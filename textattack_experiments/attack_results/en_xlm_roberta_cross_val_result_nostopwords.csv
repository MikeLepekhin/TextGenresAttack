CHAPTER VI The next day commenced as before , getting up and dressing by rushlight ; but this morning we were obliged to dispense with the ceremony of washing ; the water in the pitchers was frozen . A change had taken place in the weather the preceding evening , and a keen north-east wind , whistling through the crevices of our bedroom windows all night long , had made us shiver in our beds , and turned the contents of the ewers to ice .

That 's how I went to school -- pretty much a government guy pointing a gun , and told my father , "" You have to make a choice . "" So I walked very comfortably to this missionary school , that was run by an American missionary , and the first thing the American missionary gave me was a candy . I had never in my life ever tasted candy . So I said to myself , with all these hundred other boys , this is where I belong . Stayed -- ( Laughter ) -- when everybody else was dropping out .

I read a great article in the March 2010 Harvard Business Review . According to their research , twice as many Indian leaders as U.S. leaders think that human capital drives business success . Among the Indian firms they studied , 81 % of the heads of HR reported that employee training and development was essential to building competitive organizational capabilities , whereas according to a survey by the American Society for Training and Development , only 4 % of U.S. Chief Learning Officers head that view of their own operations . Their research demonstrates that they place an intentional focus on employee motivation by : • Creating a sense of mission ; • Engaging through transparency and accountability ; • Empowering through communication ; and • Investing in training . According to its authors , creating a real sense of social mission , whereby employees can feel that their work has impact , is a harder but achievable goal as is becoming a role model for employees . They believe Western leaders would do well to understand the managerial approaches that have fueled the rise of India's largest companies , and mindfully adapt to them .

Mitsubishi Heavy Industries has successfully tested a combined-cycle power generation system incorporating solid oxide fuel cells and a micro gas turbine , a first in Japan . MHI has been developing the system since 2004 , and the recent testing verified 75kW of power generation by the system at the company's Nagasaki Shipyard & Machinery Works . MHI now aims to start production of a 200kW combined-cycle power generation system this October . The company will then continue developing systems with larger capacities and higher efficiency to eventually develop a system suitable for utility applications . The SOFC is a ceramic-based fuel cell that directly produces electricity by chemical reaction between oxygen in the air and hydrogen removed from city gas through reforming . The SOFC-MGT combined-cycle power generation system uses unreacted hydrogen contained in the city gas exhausted from the SOFC and hot air also discharged from the SOFC . The gas and air from the SOFC are used to drive an MGT to generate electricity . This two-stage power generation system achieved power generation efficiency above 50 per cent , significantly higher than conventional power generation systems . MHI said large-scale SOFC combined-cycle power generation system could help reduce CO 2 emissions , alongside nuclear power generation and high-efficiency utility-use thermal power generation systems .

Iran Cuts Oil Exports to UK , France Iran has stopped oil exports to British and French companies , the Islamic republic's oil ministry said on Sunday . A statement the ministry's website that Iran , OPEC's second biggest oil producer after Saudi Arabia , would sell oil to "" new customers . "" Iran's English-language television station Press TV said the move was "" in line with the decision to end crude exports to six European states . "" The European Union said last month it would stop importing Iranian crude from July 1 in a bid to force Iran to agree to halt its nuclear program . Western powers suspect Iran of seeking to create a nuclear bomb but Tehran insists its program is peaceful . Iranian media reported on Wednesday that Iran had cut oil exports to the Netherlands , Greece , France , Portugal , Spain and Italy in response to the EU oil embargo , but the country's oil ministry later denied this . The 27-nation bloc currently buys about 20 percent of Iran's oil exports . </doc>",0.0

( Two varieties : mugo , eastern and uncinata , western ) Dwarf mountain pine This shrub is a native of the mountains around the Mediterranean basin . It has been widely planted in parks and gardens throughout northern Europe and America Like most pines it is host to many phytophagous species such as the pine sawfly . It also hosts adelgids - woolly aphids which are eaten by several species of ladybird . Thus the interest on this site ! All pine ( Pinus ) species have their attractions including our native P. sylvestris . Ladybirds on pines include the eyed , striped , cream-streaked and 18-spots . They are often quite numerous but are not very commonly observed since tend to stay up in the foliage at the tops of trees . Impressive , even beautiful things they may be , but only the most dedicated entomologist would be willing or able to climb a mature pine tree ( right ) . Pinus mugo has the advantage that it is seldom over 2m tall and the non-athlete can examine branch tips with ease . This shrub in Sheffield bore five species during 2004 - the best ladybird plant in the garden . This included the conifer specialist eighteen-spot and cream-streaked ladybirds as well as more generalist species . The most numerous ladybird was the cream-streaked ladybird Harmonia quadripunctata . The sixteen-spotted form ( left ) is hardly cryptic against pine needles although perhaps more so against developing cones and branch tips ( right ) ? In sunlight , the spotless form ( below far right ) seems to fit in better ? However , the larvae and pupae ( below and below left ) seem to blend much better with their environment .

Good morning . Let's look for a minute at the greatest icon of all , Leonardo da Vinci . We 're all familiar with his fantastic work -- his drawings , his paintings , his inventions , his writings . But we do not know his face . Thousands of books have been written about him , but there 's controversy , and it remains , about his looks . Even this well-known portrait is not accepted by many art historians . So what do you think ? Is this the face of Leonardo da Vinci or is n't it ? Let 's find out . Leonardo was a man that drew everything around him . He drew people , anatomy , plants , animals , landscapes , buildings , water , everything . But no faces ? I find that hard to believe . His contemporaries made faces , like the ones you see here . En face or three quarters . So surely a passionate drawer like Leonardo must have made self-portraits from time to time . So let 's try to find them . I think that if we were to scan all of his work and look for self-portraits , we would find his face looking at us . So I looked at all of his drawings , more than 700 , and looked for male portraits . There are about 120 , you see them here . Which ones of these could be self-portraits ? Well , for that they have to be done as we just saw , en face or three-quarters . So we can eliminate all the profiles . It also has to be sufficiently detailed . So we can also eliminate the ones that are very vague or very stylized .",0.0

Iran This article is about the modern nation . For other uses , see Iran ( disambiguation ) . Iran is heir to one of the world's oldest civilizations , [ 18 ] [ 19 ] beginning with the formation of the Proto-Elamite and Elamite kingdoms in 3200 – 2800 BC . The area was first unified by the Iranian Medes in 625 BC , who became the dominant cultural and political power in the region . [ 4 ] Iran reached its greatest geographic extent during the Achaemenid Empire founded by Cyrus the Great in 550 BC , which at one time stretched from parts of Eastern Europe in the west , to the Indus Valley in the east , making it the largest empire the world had yet seen . [ 20 ] The empire collapsed in 330 BC following the conquests of Alexander the Great , but reemerged shortly after as the Parthian Empire . Under the Sassanid Dynasty , Iran again became one of the leading powers in the world for the next four centuries . [ 21 ] [ 22 ] Etymology The term Iran derives directly from Middle Persian Ērān , first attested in a 3rd-century inscription at Rustam Relief , with the accompanying Parthian inscription using the term Aryān , in reference to Iranians . [ 34 ] The Middle Iranian ērān and aryān are oblique plural forms of gentilic ēr - ( Middle Persian ) and ary - ( Parthian ) , both deriving from Proto-Iranian * arya - ( meaning "" Aryan "" , i.e. "" of the Iranians "" ) , [ 34 ] [ 35 ] argued to descend from Proto-Indo-European * ar-yo - , meaning "" skillful assembler "" .

NO fine was given by the judge even though she could have done so . Barbara Harrod often "" gets "" her baby tigers from Larry Wallach whom is licensed out of NY and Ft Lauderdale . Barbara uses these babies for pets then tosses them into a tiny cage for the rest of their lives which typically is n't very long .

Xenon lights spark debate The increasing use of Xenon car headlights , which are up to three times brighter than standard halogen bulbs , is sparking a debate about whether they increase or decrease safety . 40 % of road traffic collisions take place in the hours of darkness . Driver tiredness and alcohol related factors play a part , but poor lighting is also considered a significant factor . On the one hand , reports say that Xenon lights viewing radius is increased by up to 70 % , which helps to illuminate blind spots on the road and enable drivers to see hazards such as debris , animals and pedestrians . However , there are counter arguments that the lights have dangerous implications for safety as their brightness can blind other motorists . Ken Parham , a London cabby , was so disturbed by the lights that he and Howard Redwood , a driver training consultant , have set up an online petition to persuade the government to investigate what they consider a serious problem . Ken Parham says : "" I was getting regularly blinded by fellow taxi drivers . I 've spoken to hundreds of people and about 75 % agreed that there appears to be a problem with this new type of headlight . "" Comments : I think having automatic lights is dangerous and I for one do not like this idea for this to be implemented in any vehicle and the reason has been stated here already . for a computer to have full control of lights is not a good idea . I would personally rather having full manual control of my vehicle than some computer . John , Dublin , Ireland Yes David - I 'm all for educating drivers but",0.0

The Phanerozoic Eon , also known as the eon of visible life , is divided into three major eras of time largely based on fossils of different groups of life-forms found within them : the Paleozoic ( 542 million to 251 million years ago ) , Mesozoic ( 251 million to 65.5 million years ago ) , and Cenozoic ( 65 . 5 million years ago to the present ) eras . The three eras can be divided into a collection of 12 different periods . During each period , Earth's continents made steady progress toward their present configuration through such processes as continental drift , mountain building , and continental glaciation . Although the Phanerozoic Eon represents only about the last one-eighth of time since the Earth's crust formed , its importance far exceeds its relatively short duration , because the eon is characterized by the rapid evolution of life , sometimes through cataclysmic mass extinction events , and other challenges . The descendants of these early life-forms are the plants , animals , and other life that abide on Earth today . Cambrian Period : 541 million to 485.4 million years ago Adapted from C.R. Scotese , The University of Texas at Arlington The Cambrian differed greatly from modern times , but it was also quite different from the preceding Proterozoic Eon ( 2 . 5 billion to 541 million years ago ) in terms of climate , geography , and life . Average global temperatures during much of the Neoproterozoic Era ( 1 billion to 541 million years ago ) were slightly cooler ( at around 12 ° C ) than today's average global temperature ( around 14 ° C ) However , the global average temperature of Cambrian times were warmer , averaging 22 ° C",0.0

The first five years of my life were spent on a farm in Surrey . As far as I can remember , it was idyllic . And then my father died and my mother had a sort of breakdown , so my travels began ; I ca n't recall all the people and all the places I was sent to , but wherever I was I would raid the bookcase and read - anything and everything . At six I went to boarding school where I decided I would become a concert pianist . I thought you had to be man to write books , probably because of Rudyard Kipling , R L Stevenson , Charles Dickens and Co. I had n't met Jane Austen or the Brontes . For two years I was frightened of everything and everyone , and then I became bad . When I was sixteen I decided to run away , this took the form of joining a repertory company instead of taking my A-levels . It was heaven . At twenty-one I went to London to seek my fame and fortune on the West-end stage . Nothing happened . So I became a Governess in Italy . The boys I was supposed to be teaching were bigger than I was , they educated me instead . When I returned to Britain I joined the BBC as a photographic researcher , then worked my way up to Floor Manager in the News Department and finally a Director / Editor for children's television . My producer told me I should write my own books but I did n't think I was good enough . One day I met a Welsh painter , whom I eventually married . My husband inherited an old watermill in Powys ,",0.0

Sixth session Geneva , 17-21 June 2002 The sixth session of the Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee for an International Legally Binding Instrument for Persistent Organic Pollutants was held at the Geneva International Conference Centre , Geneva , from 17 to 21 June 2002 . The session was opened by Mr. John Buccini ( Canada ) , Chair of the Committee , at 10.30 a . m . on Monday , 17 June 2002 . An opening statement was made by Mr. Philippe Roch , State Secretary , Director of the Swiss Agency for the Environment , Forests and Landscape . In his statement Mr. Roch said that persistent organic pollutants ( POPs ) present a problem of global dimension which called for concerted efforts on a global scale . In that regard , several remaining problems needed to be discussed and resolved , such as the question of technical assistance for capacity-building . An efficient way had to be found to evaluate the specific needs of different regions and subregions and the transfer of technology required by developing country Parties and Parties with economies in transition . In order to respond to the needs of the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants , and to those of the Convention to Combat Desertification , the Global Environment Facility ( GEF ) , which had been designated as the financial mechanism , must have the necessary funds at its disposal , without reducing its means of intervention in other areas , namely climate and biodiversity . He said that to enable both Conventions to enter into force it was necessary that contributions to GEF be increased . KMON On the issue of enhancing the synergies and linkages between multilateral environmental agreements , as a means of strengthening international environmental governance , Mr. Roch",0.0

T.J. Oldfield , L.S.D. Caves , B. Grant , A. Rodrigues , & C. Dieterich . The analysis of large amounts of data generated from protein X-ray crystallography / NMR , as well as genomic sequencing , is a daunting task given the size of the data . We are approaching this problem using mathematical data mining techniques . Data mining is the analysis of a set of data using only mathematical targets ( numerical occurrence , derivatives and 2nd derivatives ) to define a signal ( something interesting in the data that is not noise ) . This has the advantage that any result from the analysis is not biased by any preconceived ideas about protein structure or genome content . Its main disadvantage is that the method does not give the biological reason for a particular result because the target of the analysis is a simple mathematical metric . To date , the analysis of protein data has focused on the understanding of folds within the proteins and local interactions of residues / atoms . The latter identifies ligand-binding sites . The analysis of genomes has focused on the mathematical derivation of information content within genomes / ORFs and has generated some interesting relationships between coding and non-coding regions of genomes .

John looked all about him , drinking the clear air like wine ; then his eyes returned to the cabman's face as he sat , not ungleefully , awaiting John's communication , with the air of one looking to be tipped . The features of that face were hard to read , drink had so swollen them , drink had so painted them , in tints that varied from brick-red to mulberry . The small grey eyes blinked , the lips moved , with greed ; greed was the ruling passion ; and though there was some good nature , some genuine kindliness , a true human touch , in the old toper , his greed was now so set afire by hope , that all other traits of character lay dormant . He sat there a monument of gluttonous desire . John's heart slowly fell . He had opened his lips , but he stood there and uttered nought . He sounded the well of his courage , and it was dry . He groped in his treasury of words , and it was vacant . A devil of dumbness had him by the throat ; the devil of terror babbled in his ears ; and suddenly , without a word uttered , with no conscious purpose formed in his will , John whipped about , tumbled over the roadside wall , and began running for his life across the fallows . He had not gone far , he was not past the midst of the first afield , when his whole brain thundered within him , ' Fool ! You have your watch !

COMMITTEE ON THE RIGHTS OF THE CHILD Thirty-third session 19 May-6 June 2003 General comment No. 4 ( 2003 ) Adolescent health and development in the context of the Convention on the Rights of the Child Introduction The Convention on the Rights of the Child defines a child as "" every human being below the age of 18 years unless , under the law applicable , majority is attained earlier "" ( art . 1 ) . Consequently , adolescents up to 18 years old are holders of all the rights enshrined in the Convention ; they are entitled to special protection measures and , according to their evolving capacities , they can progressively exercise their rights ( art . Adolescence is a period characterized by rapid physical , cognitive and social changes , including sexual and reproductive maturation ; the gradual building up of the capacity to assume adult behaviours and roles involving new responsibilities requiring new knowledge and skills . While adolescents are in general a healthy population group , adolescence also poses new challenges to health and development owing to their relative vulnerability and pressure from society , including peers , to adopt risky health behaviour . These challenges include developing an individual identity and dealing with one's sexuality . The dynamic transition period to adulthood is also generally a period of positive changes , prompted by the significant capacity of adolescents to learn rapidly , to experience new and diverse situations , to develop and use critical thinking , to familiarize themselves with freedom , to be creative and to socialize . The Committee on the Rights of the Child notes with concern that in implementing their obligations under the Convention , States parties have not given sufficient attention to the specific concerns of adolescents as",0.0

Influential midfielder Steve Sidwell faces a two game ban after picking up his tenth yelow card of the season . Steve Sidwell will be forced to watch from the stands when Reading take on league leaders Ipswich Town at the Madejski Stadium next weekend . The 22-year-old , who became the club's youngest ever captain last month , faces a two-game spell on the sidelines after picking up his tenth yellow card of the season away at Burnley this afternoon . Gritty midfielder Sidwell has been a consistent performer in the centre of the park this season so will be sorely missed . The former Brighton and Brentford loanee will also miss our league game against Plymouth Argyle in early February or , if we win our Third Round replay , our FA Cup Fourth Round fixture against either Leicester or Blackpool But top of the Championship Ipswich will prove tough opponents for Reading next weekend so Harper and Hughes , who are likely to fill the two central midfield spots , will have to be at their best if the Royals are to pick up three precious points . It is thought that American winger Bobby Convey will retain his place in the team for the game against the league leaders having put in some impressive performances in his last two outings . Veteran frontman Les Ferdinand could be back from injury in time for next weekend's big game , although he will miss out on playing in Monday night's cup replay at Swansea . </doc>",0.0

Pam Musk Media Fellows Pam Musk Aligning the Strategic and Conservation Goals of New York's Audubon Centers Hilary Clinton said , "" Fail to plan , plan to fail . "" Pam Musk took her advice to heart ! She 'll employ this philosophy to transform Audubon Centers throughout New York State into the most effective hubs for conservation they can be within their communities . Musk is the Director of Centers and Education for Audubon New York , where she is responsible for both the quality of the education programs and the operations of the State's six Audubon Centers . She has seen firsthand how environmental education provides the stepping-stones needed for individuals to pursue conservation careers . She also understands that educators must meet people where they are comfortable and help them build on their comfort , knowledge , and interest in the environment . Audubon Centers are uniquely positioned to inspire individuals to get involved in the environment , as they offer physical places that attract community members . Since each Audubon Center in New York is at a different point in its development , Musk believes a concerted planning effort is critical to ensure they are effective venues for achieving strategic and conservation goals . For her TogetherGreen Conservation Fellowship , Musk designed software to plan and implement conservation , education and advocacy goals at Audubon Centers in New York . The planning now forms the basis for all work done at the Centers , whether it be conducting education programs for young children or reducing the threats to conservation targets at that site , making the Center a conservation hub within its community . She convened the partners of the Montezuma Audubon Center to complete a conservation plan for the site and started to take",0.0

Posted on Jan 8th , 2011 . 0 comments Philip Slater wrote a lot about money and sex in his 1970 book , "" The Pursuit of Loneliness . "" In the chapter , "" Putting pleasure to work , "" he describes how we eroticize anything that can be sold – cars , potato chips , toothpaste , etc – for economic reasons . "" The gross national product will reach its highest point when a material object can be interpolated between every itch and its scratch , "" Slater wrote . But for the model to work , stimulation has to be ramped up constantly . Mass media is how it gets done . Every TV show , magazine , advertisement , movie , billboard , etc. , has to be sexier than the last . At the same time , we have to clamp down on gratification . Otherwise , no sale . So Justin Timberlake can sing about bringing sexy back , but he ca n't show us Janet Jackson's nipples . That gets uncomfortably close to gratification . According to P. Slater , the job of the economy and our culture is to generate "" esoteric erotic itches that can not be scratched . "" We buy things hoping for relief , get none , and buy more . The Charlie Brown / Lucy metaphor applies – we never get to kick the football , but we never stop trying . That fact that maximum stimulation and minimum gratification drives us all crazy is an unfortunate side effect – at least the economy is functioning . Sort of . Of course , Slater was writing all this before cable television , rap music , video games , the Internet , sexting , etc. etc. etc.",0.0

I bought a tractor -- then it broke . I paid to get it repaired -- then it broke again . Then pretty soon I was broke too . I realized that the truly appropriate , low-cost tools that I needed to start a sustainable farm and settlement just did n't exist yet . I needed tools that were robust , modular , highly efficient and optimized , low-cost , made from local and recycled materials that would last a lifetime , not designed for obsolescence . I found that I would have to build them myself . So I did just that . And I tested them . And I found that industrial productivity can be achieved on a small scale .

Monday , 25 November , 2002 , 15 : 06 GMT Lords defy Blunkett on life sentences Jail terms ' should be determined by judges ' The home secretary's power to increase the minimum sentence handed down to convicted murderers is "" incompatible "" with human rights laws , the Law Lords have ruled . This is the first step towards taking away the powers home secretaries have to extend the length of time murderers must serve before they can apply for parole in England and Wales . Murderers' cases that could be reviewed : Dennis Nilsen - killed 15 men Rose West - murdered 10 young women , including her eldest daughter Heather , 16 . Arthur Hutchinson - killed a solicitor , his wife and their son and raped their daughter during a burglary Jeremy Bamber - killed his adoptive parents , his step-sister and her six-year-old twin sons In a test case affecting 225 prisoners , a specially convened panel of seven Law Lords accepted the argument by defence lawyers that judges should be handed back the task of fixing minimum tariffs for prisoners serving life for murder . Lord Bingham said the power exercised by the home secretary to decide how long sentences should be , was "" incompatible "" with article six of the European Convention on Human Rights - the right of a convicted person to have a sentence imposed by an independent and impartial tribunal . But Home Secretary David Blunkett has promised new laws to establish a set of principles which judges will use to fix minimum tariffs in the future .

Carlos Fallanty lost his wife at the time of the Violent Unknown Event . She was a voluble , untidy woman who made her own clothes and washed once a week in the water wrung out of the laundry . She was invaluable to her husband . She looked after his poultry , kept his accounts , and when roused , was as uxorious a wife as Carlos could wish to have . On the night of June 12th of the VUE , Carlos's wife suffered a stroke , and Carlos transferred his affection to a turkey . The VUE Directory records for Carlos a debilitating malfunction of the left ventricle , bone-marrow disease , and save for the VUE immortality clause , would have normally given him six months to live . Carlos had buried his wife in the floor of his greenhouse . The local authorities later had the body exhumed . Now Carlos lived in the greenhouse to keep his turkey company . A fowl-pest epidemic finally erased Carlos's other poultry , and two veterinary officials came to make sure he had burnt or buried all the corpses . Insisting that the one remaining bird should be destroyed as well , the vet promised to compensate Carlos with at least a set of photographs . These are the photographs taken as the vet stalked the bird with his camera , whilst the vet's assistant stalked the bird with a shotgun . Carlos was not happy with the photographs . He is now awaiting trial at Clichy for shooting the vet . </doc>",0.0

Russia's Ukrainian Path to the Future MOSCOW – Russia and the West are losing each other yet again . The magnetic attraction and repulsion between the two has been going on for centuries . Indeed , historians have counted as many as 25 such cycles since the reign of Tsar Ivan III . In the past , however , Russia's sharp anti-Western turns were reversed – usually out of simple necessity – after relations reached rock bottom . Not this time . On the contrary , the deterioration of the relationship nowadays has developed a momentum of its own . There are four reasons for this . First , the "" loss "" of the Cold War , and with it imperial and superpower status , has created a deep and so far unresolved crisis in the collective mentality of Russia's political class . Russian leaders continue to perceive the West as a phantom enemy in opposition to which all the traditional mythologies of Russian foreign policy are being resurrected . Second , by the end of Vladimir Putin's second presidential term , Russia's modernizing dreams had been shattered . Modernization , indeed , simply turned out to be yet another redistribution of property to those on top , particularly those who came out of the St. Petersburg mayoral office and the Federal Security Bureau ( FSB ) . The image of the West as an enemy has become the only ideological excuse for Putin's model of the corporate state . Third , the soaring price of oil has made the Kremlin's inhabitants believe that they are all-powerful . Today's Russia , which thinks of itself as a "" great energy state , "" laughs at its previous meager desire to catch up with little Portugal in terms of living",0.0

This is preserved intact . His mother , Mary Arden , was one of the daughters of Robert Arden , a yeoman farmer of Wilmcote : his father , John Shakespeare , was a glover and wool dealer of good standing who held the office of Bailiff of the Borough in 1568 . From the age of seven to about 14 , he attended Stratford Grammar School receiving an excellent well rounded education . At the age of 18 he married Anne Hathaway , who was seven years his senior and three months pregnant . She was of ' yeoman ' stock - her family owned a farm one mile west of Stratford in Shottery . He endured her until he could stand it no longer and fled to London to become an actor . He then became actor-manager and part-owner in the Blackfriars and afterwards the Globe Theatres . He was a first-rate actor , but it is as a writer of plays that he has achieved lasting world-wide fame . His plays are thought to be the finest ever written in any language . His 37 plays vary in type ; historical romances , light , fantastic comedies , some are tragedies , all including the comical and the farcical . He was",0.0

Queensland ( abbreviated as QLD ) is the second-largest and third-most-populous state in the Commonwealth of Australia . Situated in the north-east of the country , it is bordered by the Northern Territory , South Australia and New South Wales to the west , south-west and south respectively . To the east , Queensland is bordered by the Coral Sea and Pacific Ocean . Queensland has a population of 4,750,500 , concentrated along the coast and particularly in the state's South East . The state is the world's sixth largest sub-national entity , with an area of 1,852,642 km 2 . The capital and largest city in the state is Brisbane , Australia's third largest city . Often referred to as the "" Sunshine State "" , Queensland is home to 10 of Australia's 30 largest cities and is the nation's third largest economy . Tourism in the state , fuelled largely by its warm tropical climate , is a major industry . The history of Queensland spans thousands of years , encompassing both a lengthy indigenous presence , as well as the eventful times of post-European settlement . The north-eastern Australian region was explored by Dutch , Spaniards and French navigators before being encountered by Lieutenant James Cook in 1770 . The state has witnessed frontier warfare between European settlers and Indigenous inhabitants ( which did not result in any settlement or treaty ) , as well as the exploitation of cheap Kanaka labour sourced from the South Pacific through a form of forced recruitment known at the time as "" blackbirding "" . The Australian Labor Party has its origin as a formal organisation in Queensland and the town of Barcaldine is the symbolic birthplace of the party .

Dear Ms. Blacksmith , Did you know that in Genovia : · Only 33 % of kids get to see the inside of a high school classroom ? · 56 % of kids will die from starvation or easily-curable diseases before they see adulthood ? · 98 % of the population is illiterate ? When I 'm asked why we should care about what happens in Genovia , I think about Sophie . When Sophie first came to our school , she could n't read . As the eldest sister , she was in charge of caring for her siblings while her parents went out and worked . Her future looked bleak : without an education , she was destined to live a life on the streets . Because of our mobile school for Genovian children , we were able to provide comprehensive care for Sophie's whole family . Sophie went to school , while her younger siblings were also cared for . Sophie is in medical school now . Her goal ? To become a doctor , and come back to work with Genovian children to provide much-needed health care . Investing in Sophie's life , was like investing in all the children of Genovia . This year , we have the ambitious goal of opening more Mobile Classrooms . Wo n't you consider helping us give the children of Genovia a brighter future ? After all , your small investment can last for generations . Sincerely , Francis Fake , Executive Director Hope for Genovia </doc>",0.0

At the start of the game , players draw lots to decide which colour will go first . Rules : The objective is to get all your own counters in the hole before your opponent does . To do this , you use your own yellow counter and your cue to hit the others in . Each time you get one of your own counters in the hole , you earn an extra hit . By getting one of your opponent's counters in the hole , you get no extra hits , and you lose your turn to your opponent . If you get the yellow counter into the hole , you are penalized by having to take one of your counters out of the hole . Hit : Lay the yellow tile on the line closest to you . Press the button on your mouse and hold it down while you aim . Draw the mouse toward you while continuing to press the button to increase the speed of your shot .

Fisherman's Friends deaths : Door company fined £ 30 , 000 A company has been fined £ 30 , 000 following the deaths of a shanty group singer and the band's promoter after a two-tonne steel door fell on them . The stage door collapsed on Fisherman's Friends vocalist Trevor Grills and Paul McMullen at Guildford's G Live venue in 2013 . Shropshire-based Express Hi-Fold Doors Ltd was found guilty of a health and safety breach at Guildford Crown Court . Director David Naylor , 57 , was cleared of manslaughter by gross negligence . The door , which allowed backstage access from outside , was designed and manufactured by the company . Father-of-three Mr Grills , 54 , from Port Isaac , Cornwall , and Mr McMullen , from Disley in Cheshire , were at the venue ahead of a performance due to be staged by the 10-piece group . Mr McMullen , 44 , died at the scene and Mr Grills in hospital three days later . Sentencing , judge Philippa Whipple , said there was no "" deliberate disregard for the law "" but the company "" fell far short of the appropriate health and safety standard "" . The court heard the door had been folded in half and was being lifted "" like a canopy "" above the men when it collapsed . Two drive chains linking the motor and gearbox to the drive shaft failed , and the chains themselves also failed , jurors were told . The court heard there had been four similar failures involving the company's doors before 2010 , including the collapse of a hangar door at Shoreham Airport in 2003 . The judge said : "" The company made some modifications , but it failed to respond more fundamentally",0.0

Letter dated 7 October 2001 from the Chargé d ' affaires a . i . of the Permanent Mission of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland to the United Nations addressed to the President of the Security Council In accordance with Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations , I wish on behalf of my Government to report that the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland has military assets engaged in operations against targets that we know to be involved in the operation of terror against the United States of America , the United Kingdom and other countries around the world , as part of a wider international effort . These forces have now been employed in exercise of the inherent right of individual and collective self-defence , recognized in Article 51 , following the terrorist outrage of 11 September , to avert the continuing threat of attacks from the same source . My Government presented information to the United Kingdom Parliament on 4 October which showed that Usama Bin Laden and his Al-Qaeda terrorist organization have the capability to execute major terrorist attacks , claimed credit for past attacks on United States targets , and have been engaged in a concerted campaign against the United States and its allies . One of their stated aims is the murder of United States citizens and attacks on the allies of the United States . This military action has been carefully planned , and is directed against Usama Bin Laden's Al-Qaeda terrorist organization and the Taliban regime that is supporting it . Targets have been selected with extreme care to minimize the risk to civilians . It is important to underline that these operations are not directed against the Afghan population , or against Islam",0.0

A heart murmur is a result of faulty blood flow within the heart . The familiar ' lub-dub ' sound of the heartbeat is brought on by the rhythmic closing of the heart valves . A heart murmur is an additional humming or whooshing sound , taking place between the heartbeat sounds . Lots of kids have ' innocent ' heart murmurs that do not require treatment . Nevertheless a harmful heart murmur may be a result of congenital heart disorders , mitral regurgitation , aortic regurgitation , mitral stenosis , harm to the cardiac muscle , anaemia , hyperthyroidism or stress . The acquainted ' lub-dub ' sound of the heartbeat is caused by the rhythmic closing of the heart valves as the blood is pumped in and out from the chambers . A heart murmur is a sound brought on by blood flow within the heart . Instead of ' lub-dub ' , the heartbeat may have an added sound like a hum , a whoosh or a rasp . The reason for the whooshing sound is the vibration of blood as it circulates through the heart , that is generally undetectable by stethoscope . Blood can flow abnormally through the heart for several reasons including defective valves , congenital heart disorders as well as anaemia . A ' noisy ' heart is n't always a sign of health problem or malfunction . Several kids have ' innocent ' heart murmurs that do n't require any treatment or observation . However , medical tests are usually needed to distinguish between a hazardous heart murmur and an innocent one , since they could sound the same through a stethoscope . Symptoms Heart murmurs are themselves usually asymptomatic ( have no symptoms ) . Commonly , they are innocent and",0.0

Now most of the time , you think of pain as a symptom of a disease . And that 's true most of the time . It 's the symptom of a tumor or an infection or an inflammation or an operation . But about 10 percent of the time , after the patient has recovered from one of those events , pain persists . It persists for months and oftentimes for years .

Findings The literature review showed that strong coupling between component pairs often forces changes to propagate between them . Also , components may have strong dependencies between them even though they may not interact directly . These couplings are not always obvious due to the complex nature of component interactions . Early results suggests that hierarchical products models may be suitable for modelling such complex interactions to enable effective product change

Findings The literature review showed that strong coupling between component pairs often forces changes to propagate between them . Also , components may have strong dependencies between them even though they may not interact directly . These couplings are not always obvious due to the complex nature of component interactions . Early results suggests that hierarchical products models may be suitable for modelling such complex interactions to enable effective product change",0.0

The normal thing is for internet marketing <font color = blue>specialists</font> to take charge on their own on-page SEO and to outsource the link building aspect . This makes sense as they have specialist knowledge with conversion optimization and may constantly tweak landing pages . Having knowledge of both conversion optimization and SEO enables an internet marketer to build a high converting and well optimized landing page . The majority focus would be on the sales conversion aspect while good basic on-site SEO would enable each landing page to have a decent organic SEO ranking . Working with a company with specialist knowledge of internet marketing SEO can further improve potential returns . This is due to them having expert staff members able to deal with both aspects of performing SEO and optimizing landing pages for sales conversion . As more and more people turn to the internet to buy goods and services , it is becoming more important to rank highly on search engines to get found . Competition is fierce and will continue to grow in the next few years . This could mean a profitable internet marketer doing everything themselves quickly falls behind and struggles to survive . If they had outsourced the work beforehand when the times were good it would be easier for them to remain profitable as they would have a much more diverse product range to offer consumers . </doc>

I 'd like to talk today about the two biggest social trends in the coming century , and perhaps in the next 10,000 years . But I want to start with my work on romantic love , because that 's my most recent work . What I and my colleagues did was to put 32 people , who were madly in love , into a functional MRI brain scanner . 17 who were madly in love and their love was accepted ; and 15 who were madly in love and they had just been dumped . And so I want to tell you about that first , and then go on into where I think love is going . "" What ' tis to love ? "" Shakespeare said . I think our ancestors -- I think human beings have been wondering about this question since they sat around their campfires or lay and watched the stars a million years ago . I started out by trying to figure out what romantic love was by looking at the last 45 years of research on -- just the psychological research , and as it turns out , there 's a very specific group of things that happen when you fall in love . The first thing that happens is what I call -- a person begins to take on what I call , "" special meaning . "" As a truck driver once said to me , he said , "" The world had a new center , and that center was Mary Anne . "" George Bernard Shaw said it a little differently . He said , "" Love consists of overestimating the differences between one woman and another . "" And indeed , that 's what we do .",0.0

As someone who has spent his entire career trying to be invisible , standing in front of an audience is a cross between an out-of-body experience and a deer caught in the headlights , so please forgive me for violating one of the TED commandments by relying on words on paper , and I only hope I 'm not struck by lightning bolts before I 'm done . I 'd like to begin by talking about some of the ideas that motivated me to become a documentary photographer . I was a student in the '60s , a time of social upheaval and questioning , and on a personal level , an awakening sense of idealism . The war in Vietnam was raging , the Civil Rights Movement was under way , and pictures had a powerful influence on me . Our political and military leaders were telling us one thing , and photographers were telling us another . I believed the photographers , and so did millions of other Americans . Their images fueled resistance to the war and to racism . They not only recorded history , they helped change the course of history . Their pictures became part of our collective consciousness and , as consciousness evolved into a shared sense of conscience , change became not only possible , but inevitable . I saw that the free flow of information represented by journalism , specifically visual journalism , can bring into focus both the benefits and the cost of political policies . It can give credit to sound decision making , adding momentum to success . In the face of poor political judgment or political inaction , it becomes a kind of intervention , assessing the damage and asking us to reassess our behavior . It",0.0

Japanese Lessons for China's Currency SHANGHAI – The question of how much China's currency should appreciate to rebalance its trade has become a global hot-button issue . But the answers have been all over the map , with some finding that the yuan is not undervalued at all , while others argue that it should appreciate against the dollar by more than 30 % . Clearly , there must be major differences in the macroeconomic models used to produce such a wide range of estimates . But the one thing about which everyone seems to agree is the theoretically and empirically unjustified assumption that an equilibrium exchange rate actually exists . The theoretical problem is simple : a country's trade balance depends on a lot more than the value of its currency in the foreign exchange markets . Interest rates , employment , aggregate demand , and technological and institutional innovation all play a role . As the economist Joan Robinson pointed out in 1947 , just about any exchange rate will be the equilibrium value for some combination of these other variables . The equilibrium exchange rate , she famously argued , is a chimera . Not surprisingly , the empirical evidence that trade imbalances can be resolved through exchange rate changes alone is unconvincing . In the case of China , the most useful precedent is probably that of Japan in the period from the end of the Bretton Woods fixed exchange-rate regime in August , 1971 , to the collapse of its "" bubble economy "" in 1990 . During that period , the yen's value more than doubled against the dollar , rising from its original fixed rate of 360 to 144 at the end of 1989 . Yet , even as Japan's exports became much",0.0

Sometimes it 's easy to overlook that your distribution center is called upon to operate as a two-way street : Product heads out in one direction , but it also can shift into reverse and come back to you . One of the biggest problems with this boomerang effect is the time it takes for distribution centers to figure out what to do with returned goods . After all , the primary goal is to get goods out of the door . Hence , reverse logistics . As fast as you can ship out a product , it can be headed right back to you . The better prepared you are to handle such situations , the more smoothly your distribution center will function . The fact that many businesses are willing to pay someone else to take care of this tells you it 's a valuable service . And if someone 's willing to pay an outsider to come in and do it , why not do it yourself and save the money ? Time is the single greatest enemy to handling reverse logistics . Processes grind to a halt and distribution center employees are forced to research and make decisions for each item or product that comes back in your door . There 's a two-step solution for this : Identify the categories / reasons for return , and There are seven core reasons for returns : manufacturing problem service problem recalls end-of-life obsolete end-of-use problem under warranty Once you 've determined the core cause for return , it 's easier to drop it into one of six "" asset recovery disposition "" buckets : restock to resell refurbish destroy repackage to resell sell to secondary market , and return to manufacturer .

Posts Tagged ' steel school buildings ' Let 's face it . Educational systems are often faced with budget constraints , especially with regards to new construction . However , when there is already an acute need for more space and there is no other way but to build a new structure , there is an alternative to traditional construction that is not only cost-effective nut also long-lasting . Over the years , prefabricated steel buildings have evolved from unsightly metal boxes used as warehouses or factories to today's metal structures that are things of beauty , with some even considered as works of art . Truly , there are still metal warehouses and factories . But applications of modern prefabricated steel buildings are now found in all sectors of the economy including industrial complexes , commercial centers , office spaces , supermarkets , strip malls , retail stores , airport hangars , churches , temples , residences and many more . Prefabricated steel buildings may seem costly upon purchase . But in the long run and starting from their construction , owners will already enjoy the savings that they offer . That is why school buildings made of steel is a viable idea . The cost-effectiveness of prefabricated steel buildings starts from their time they are constructed . The whole structure is computer-engineered and all the components are manufactured in the factory based on their exact specifications . This is the reason why the construction of prefabricated steel buildings is simple , fast and efficient . The only thing that needs to be done is to connect the elements with the stainless steel fasteners and the building is done , resulting in savings of up to 50 % off the cost of traditional construction . After construction , expect",0.0

A true picture of how busy we are IT IS a common and justifiable complaint by police forces across the country - they only get the credit for half the work they do . Scores of incidents each day , many of them reports of anti-social behaviour , go unaccounted for because they are not classed as crime . The result is a false picture of just how busy the police service is . Now , thanks to Cambridgeshire and 10 other forces , all that could be about to change . From the start of next month ( April ) , the 11 will take part in a pilot scheme aimed ultimately at the introduction of a National Standard for Incident Recording ( NSIR ) . NSIR is widely seen as a natural progression from the controversial National Crime Recording Standard , enabling performance management to also focus on the non-crime work which occupies so much of police time . The pilot scheme , and a second pilot which is intended to include all forces from October this year , is aimed at the national adoption of NSIR in April next year . That will give the first comprehensive and accurate picture of police work at local and national levels , catering for all performance information needs . Cambridgeshire and the 11 other chosen forces' role in the first pilot scheme will be to test and challenge the design of NSIR to assess its value , including its ability to provide a customer - focused approach . The Home Office , which is driving NSIR , has identified 57 incidents to target during the pilot . These are split into four categories - road related , anti-social behaviour , public safety and crime related . It is demanding compliance",0.0

Date : April 2006 Implementation date : April 2006 Review Date : October 2008 GUIDELINES FOR SUPERVISORS OF MIDWIVES IN THE EAST MIDLANDS MATERNAL DEATHS BACKGROUND The Confidential Enquiry into Maternal and Child Health ( previously CEMD ) is a triennial report , which provides on overview of the numbers and causes of maternal death in the United Kingdom . The collated and anonymised information shows where improvements in clinical practice or service provision may help to prevent future deaths . It is therefore important that all cases are notified promptly so that full information on each case is readily available . CEMD and the Confidential Enquiry into Stillbirths and Infant Deaths ( CESDI ) merged to form the Confidential Enquiry into Maternal and Child Health ( CEMACH ) on the 1 st April 2003 . These enquiries form part of the National Institute of Clinical Excellence ( NICE ) work programme . It is statutory requirement that all health professionals provide information and participate in confidential enquiries and supervisors of midwives should ensure that other areas of the health service , such as Accident and Emergency units and Intensive Care are aware of this requirement and have a local process in place to report maternal deaths to the supervisor of midwives . The aims and objectives of the CEMACH Enquiry are to ; · Assess the main causes of and trends in maternal deaths",0.0

Take Action – Now ! If it 's going to be , it 's up to me In my clinical practice , I treat people who suffer from just about every imaginable emotional malady – depression , anxiety , anger , addictions , eating disorders , sexual malfunctions , obsessions and compulsions , borderline personality disorders , impulsive acting out , relationship dysfunction , and on and on . To every single one of my patients , I emphasize how important it is for them to step up to the plate and take responsibility for their recovery . How do I do this ? I first help them understand the precise nature and cause of their problems . Then , in the spirit of what the psychologist Carl Rogers taught , "" Insight is necessary but not sufficient , "" I do my best to convince them that , to get better , they need to work hard , really hard , not only during our sessions , but also in the days between our sessions . I tell them : "" The measly forty-five minutes you spend with me each week pales in comparison to the hours you spend with yourself , unwittingly rehearsing and practicing your irrational thinking and dysfunctional behavior . I 'll do everything in my power to teach you what to do , but , if you do n't work your therapy every day , you could very well come to our next appointment next week worse than better . "" In this vein , I make it a point to never let a patient leave my office without at least one between-session therapy assignment . It can be some therapeutic reading , a cognitive restructuring assignment , a behavioral task , or some combination",0.0

What is the latest age that reading <font color = red>should</font> be taught formally ? And is this a <font color = red>good</font> idea ?

Dr Tom Sticht <font color = red>said</font> : There is no latest age . People all around the world have learned to read up into their late age . In the <font color = red>US</font> adults well into their <font color = red>retirement</font> ages have learned to read . Professor Peter Tymms said : This is a very interesting question to which I do n't think there is a clear answer . There has been a lot of work carried out on school readiness and much research has been carried out into child <font color = red>development</font> . There are also good assessments of young children , which are predictive of later success in reading and early mathematics . However , it has not been demonstrated that there is a particular stage or age at which children should or should not start school or be formally introduced to reading . It is , however , clear that individuals should not be introduced to anything more advanced than their next phase of their developmental trajectory - the zone of proximal development to use Vygotsky's phrase . For different children they will be ready to start to read at different ages . Most children can learn to ready at the age of 4 or 5 , this could be delayed until 7 or later . But what is best ?

The Winchester Mystery House was the estate of Sarah Winchester , widow of gun magnate William Winchester . Legend has it that Mrs. Winchester believed the home was haunted by people killed by Winchester rifles , and only constant construction and remodeling of the mansion would appease the ghosts . Nightly séances informed her building plans , and construction financed by the Winchester rifle fortune continued day and night from 1884 until her death in 1922 , resulting in a 160 room mansion . The current owners of the mansion registered the "" Winchester Mystery House "" word mark and a logo with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office , and have extensively marketed the tourist attraction locally and internationally . In 2008 , the owners entered into an exclusive movie agreement with a production company for use of the house as a location , and for use of certain trademarks and copyrights in promotional materials . The following year , the Defendant , another production company , inquired with Plaintiff about rates for using the house for a low budget haunted house / ghost story movie . Plaintiff declined to give Defendant location rates and mentioned that it had signed a contract with "" another company for the exclusive rights to the Winchester story , "" but they failed to give additional details . Defendant went ahead and filmed its movie , using Plaintiff's word mark in the film's title , "" Haunting of Winchester House . "" The film was loosely based on the story of Sarah Winchester , with additional fictional elements , and the DVD cover featured a shot of a different Victorian-style house . Defendant publicized production of the film on its website in July 2009 , and Plaintiff immediately sent Defendant a cease and",0.0

President : Mr. Petko Draganov ( Bulgaria ) The PRESIDENT : I declare open the 861st plenary meeting of the Conference , the last for the 2000 session . I should like at the outset to extend a warm welcome , on behalf of us all , to the three new colleagues who have recently joined us as representatives of their Governments to the Conference , Ambassador Roberto Betancourt Ruales of Ecuador , Ambassador Rakesh Sood of India and Ambassador Mario Maioloini of Italy , and assure them of our full cooperation and support in the discharge of their functions . Allow me also to bid farewell to the representative of Ukraine , Ambassador Mykola Maimeskul , who , I understand , will soon be leaving his post to take up important responsibilities in his Government . Ambassador Maimeskul has represented his country in this Conference since August 1996 and we had the privilege to work under his presidency at a difficult time , when efforts were being made to widen the areas of agreement on the Conference's programme of work . He discharged his functions with dedication and diplomatic skill . It is an especially moving occasion for me , because he was presiding over this Conference when I first appeared in it and you will also recall that it was under his presidency and skilful leadership of this Conference that the Conference took a decision on the establishment of the Ad Hoc Committee on fissile material . I am sure that you will all join me in extending to him and his family our best wishes for the future . I have on",0.0

Fair Value in Utah Author ; Talon C. Stringham & Derk G. Rasmussen We 've all seen it : shareholders who ca n't get along . So what happens when the shareholders of a private company ca n't resolve their differences ? In Utah , there are two statutes that govern these situations . The first , known as a judicial dissolution statute , applies when shareholders are deadlocked . This statute allows a shareholder to petition the court to dissolve the corporation or , pursuant to an election , allows the corporation to repurchase shares for fair value . The second , known as a dissident shareholder action , allows minority shareholders that have been "" squeezed out "" to dissent from the corporate action and receive fair value for their shares . Helpful Employment Law Websites Author ; Compiled by Katherine K. Hudman How long does a plaintiff have to file an employment discrimination charge with the EEOC ? What should an employer's family medical leave policy say ? Are employees entitled to a lunch break ? Answers to these , and many other employment law questions , can be found on the Internet . Making Your Case at the Legislature There is a considerable difference between making the law and applying it . Making the law is not about reaching a favorable result based on a particular set of facts . It is , instead , about making the case for why a certain word or concept is worthwhile and socially acceptable as compared to the alternatives . Clearly , we , as lawyers , can make this case , whether in support or opposition to a bill , and make it quite effectively by , among other things , keeping in mind some of the following",0.0

What is a relational database ? A relational database consists of two or more tables whose records are related to each other . The relationship is created by linking a field in one table with a field in another table . Both these fields must be exactly the same datatype . In one of the tables it must be a Primary Key . Key fields are the heart of relational database management . The value in a key field uniquely identifies a particular occurrence of a given record type . For example a customer record might have a key field called Account and a particular customer's Account field might have a value of 123 to distinguish it from others . Storing copies of the value 123 in order records generated by that customer lets us relate the customers and order records . Only one customer record can have an account number of 123 but many order records can have the value 123 , relating them to the same customer . This is called a one-to-many relationship . The golden rule of relational database design : Never store the same information twice unless there is a very good reason The advantage of a relational database is that there is no more duplication , other than the link fields . The following diagram illustrates this . The Primary Keys for each table are in blue . ( Only a few fields are shown . ) Looking at the customers table , if we want to know more about the rep for each customer , all the data is contained in the Sales Rep table . The sales rep for customer accounts 123 and 124 is AJ and this links to the Primary key AJ in the sales Rep table , so we",0.0

The college recruits police officers who are at the leading edge of their specialism to train other police officers - in ICT , for example . These trainers stay on average three years in the college before returning to normal duties . So there is constant movement of officers ( or students as we would now like to call them ) . The intention is to make the work based learning programme compulsory guaranteeing a healthy supply of students . The officers have a qualification up to level two , so by undertaking six modules at level three with Glasgow Caledonian University over their stay at Jackton , they will be able to graduate with a general degree . The curriculum will cover : Personal and Professional Development ; Teaching and Learning ; Leadership , Motivation and Group Dynamics ; Curriculum Development including Training Needs Analysis ; Quality and Evaluation and Organisational Culture and Change .

Annex to the letter dated 5 July 2006 from the Permanent Representative of the Sudan to the United Nations addressed to the President of the Security Council [ Original : Arabic ] At a time when the Government of National Unity and its partners from the Sudan Liberation Movement ( SLM ) are intent on implementing the Darfur Peace Agreement , we regret to inform you of a treacherous act of aggression perpetrated with the aim of wrecking the Darfur Peace Agreement in its early stages and extinguishing the glimmer of hope for the restoration of peace and stability in the Darfur region . This act constitutes a blatant challenge to the will for peace and to the will of the international community , in particular the Security Council . It is hardly surprising that such an act of aggression should have been perpetrated at this time by a group that openly refused to sign the Agreement and publicly",0.0

Policy Statement by Achim Steiner , UN Under-Secretary General and UNEP Executive Director at the 24th Session of the UNEP Governing Council / Global Ministerial Environment Forum ( GC / GMEF ) President of the Governing Council , Excellencies , Ladies and Gentlemen , Dear Colleagues , I would like to make this statement a policy statement of major issues and priorities alongside reporting back to you on our activities at UNEP since taking up the post of Executive Director seven months ago . However let me begin by stating something referred to a number of times this morning -- this Governing Council may just be a Governing Council like others before it , some times interesting , some times important and some times controversial . But all too often the GC and the GMEF have not been moments when the world's environment ministers met and the world listened . In fact , very often we meet in the context of GCs and GMEFs and talk about some of the most pressing issues of our time . Yet apart from",0.0

Aggression by the Republic of Armenia against the Republic of Azerbaijan 49 - 53 11 Efforts to mediate a settlement to the conflict 54 - 58 12 The Republic of Azerbaijan lies in the borderlands of Asia and Europe . It is situated in the south-eastern part of the southern Caucasus and shares borders in the north with the Russian Federation , the south with the Islamic Republic of Iran , the west with Turkey , Georgia and Armenia and in the east its neighbours across the Caspian Sea are Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan . The Autonomous Republic of Naxçivan is part of the Republic of Azerbaijan . History Scholars consider Azerbaijan to include "" the land populated today by the Azeri Turks , the people who inhabit the region stretching from the northern slopes of the Caucuses mountains along the Caspian Sea to the Iranian plateau "" . Azerbaijan is among the areas of earliest human settlement , with evidence of human habitation since the Palaeolithic age . Settlements engaging in agriculture and livestock-raising were widely distributed about this area in the seventh and sixth millennia BC . Rock paintings in Gobustan near Baku are dated by scholars to the end of the seventh and beginning of the sixth millennia BC . The well-known Norwegian explorer Thor Heyerdal , who made special trips to Baku in 1979 and 1994 to study these rock paintings , believes that the shores of the Caspian Sea were the cradle for the civilization which then spread over water , southward and northward . Heyerdal found support for his hypothesis not only in the Gobustan petroglyphs of reed boats , remarkably similar",0.0

Back in December , our Humane Law Enforcement Agents arrived at Dennis' Brooklyn home and found Dora in a severely neglected state . They rushed the skeletal dog to the ASPCA's Bergh Memorial Animal Hospital where veterinarians discovered she weighed 6.55 pounds . Dora was put on intravenous fluids to combat dehydration , and her coat was shaved due to excessive , painful matting . "" You do n't have to hit , beat or kick an animal to be cruel to them , "" says Howard Lawrence , Senior Director of Operations for the ASPCA's Humane Law Enforcement Department . "" Animal <font color = red>cruelty</font> also includes situations where an owner fails to provide necessary food , water , shelter or veterinary care . "" Since 2010 , 83 percent of the ASPCA's arrests have involved some form of animal neglect . After receiving intensive treatment , Dora now weighs 9.2 pounds – a 40 percent increase ! She is continuing her recovery at the hospital and will eventually be made available for adoption . But sometimes that very attribute that we all seek in our pets – the ability to live long , healthy and happy lives – can present a challenge . This is particularly the case with large captive exotic birds such as parrots , macaws and cockatoos that can live more than 65 years . Since many large birds can outlive their human guardians , they are often by necessity re-homed several times during their lives . Unfortunately , it 's often difficult to re-home a bird and many animal shelters do not take in homeless birds . Birds of all sizes can be wonderful companions , as they are intelligent and captivating . They can also be loud and messy when expressing their natural behaviors .

University of Sheffield - Reduce Your Testing on Animals Freedom of Information requests discovered that the University of Sheffield killed 82,512 animals in tests during the 2015 / 16 academic year - an average of 226 animals killed each day . In 2014 / 15 , 67,236 animals were used and killed for testing purposes , with this figure going up 22.7 % during 2015 / 16 . The University should be cutting down not increasing the number of animals it uses in experiments ! With almost 90 % of drugs that pass animal tests failing human trials , these animals are undergoing immense suffering for very limited benefit , undermining public support , social progression and current medicinal advancements . We are requesting for the University to move away from testing on animals such as pigs , rabbits , mice , rats , gerbils and fish and to cruelty-free testing methods such as digital dissection software and human simulators . </doc>",0.0

Water vapor is the most potent of the greenhouse gases in Earth's atmosphere , and it 's sort of a unique player among the greenhouse gases . The amount of water vapor in the atmosphere can not , in general , be directly modified by human behavior – it 's set by air temperatures . The warmer the surface , the greater the evaporation rate of water from the surface . As a result , increased evaporation leads to a greater concentration of water vapor in the lower atmosphere capable of absorbing infrared radiation and emitting it downward . Surface-level ozone Johnny Stockshooter – age fotostock / Imagestate The next most significant greenhouse gas is surface , or low-level , ozone ( O 3 ) . Surface O 3 is a result of air pollution ; it must be distinguished from naturally occurring stratospheric O 3 , which has a very different role in the planetary radiation balance . The primary natural source of surface O 3 is the subsidence of stratospheric O 3 from the upper atmosphere toward Earth's surface . In contrast , the primary human-driven source of surface O 3 is in photochemical reactions involving carbon monoxide ( CO ) , such as in smog . </doc>",0.0

Finding Your Next Superstar Although your admissions staff is likely complete at this point in the cycle , it 's never too early to start the search for new talent . How to spot the next superstar to bring in well-qualified students who will be retained and wo n't require heavy discounting to enroll ? One who will stay more than a year or two , wo n't experience premature burnout and has the potential to be promoted ? While your own student ambassadors and tour guides are an obvious starting point , beware of filling your permanent openings exclusively from their ranks . As a young alumnus , your current student guides will likely have only one institutional perspective , and that , from a student point of view . Can they adjust that focus to include the viewpoints of families and referral sources , as well ? One obvious danger of going directly from the classroom to an entry-level admissions office at the same college or university is that your new staffer will not know his or her "" subject "" well . As a student , his or her "" subject "" was English , or education , or business . Now , as an alumnus and novice admissions counselor , the subject to master is "" your institution . "" Can your new staffer transcend his or her personal student experiences to take a broader , objective view ?

Hanukkah falls on the eve of the 25th of the Jewish month of Kislev and lasts eight days . That lands it somewhere in December ( though in 2013 it fell on Thanksgiving in November , an extremely rare occurrence ) . In 2016 – or 5777 , according to the Jewish calendar – Hanukkah begins at sundown on December 24 and lasts through January 1 . For the first time since 1978 , Hanukkah will overlap with the Christmas holiday and end on New Year's Day . Also called the Festival of Lights , Hanukkah celebrates events from more than 2,000 years ago . First and foremost , it commemorates the rededication of the Second Temple in Jerusalem after a successful revolt of the Jewish people led by Judah Maccabee against their Syrian-Greek oppressors , who had tried to assimilate the Jewish people and , in so doing , had desecrated the Temple . The reason the holiday is celebrated for eight days stems from what is told in the Talmud : when it came time for the rededication of the Second Temple , only one day's worth of pure oil was found to use in the temple's menorah – which was meant to burn all night every night – but miraculously the oil burned for eight days . This gave enough time to collect a fresh supply of oil and , with the belief that a miracle from God had occurred , a reason to celebrate for a full eight days . Today , especially in North America , Hanukkah is often thought of as the Jewish counterpart to Christmas , an association that developed because of Hanukkah's proximity to December 25 . The giving of gifts and displaying of holiday decorations have nothing to do with the",0.0

We 're 25 , 26 years after the advent of the Macintosh , which was an astoundingly seminal event in the history of human-machine interface , and in computation in general . It fundamentally changed the way that people thought about computation , thought about computers , how they used them and who and how many people were able to use them . It was such a radical change , in fact , that the early Macintosh development team in ' 82 , ' 83 , ' 84 , had to write an entirely new operating system from the ground up . Now , this is an interesting little message , and it 's a lesson that has since , I think , been forgotten or lost or something . And that is , namely , that the OS is the interface . The interface is the OS . It 's like the land and the king ( i . e . Arthur ) they 're inseparable , they are one . And to write a new operating system was not a capricious matter . It was n ' t just a matter of tuning up some graphics routines . There were no graphics routines . There were no mouse drivers . So it was a necessity . But in the quarter century since then , we 've seen all of the fundamental supporting technologies go berserk . So memory capacity and disk capacity have been multiplied by something between 10,000 and a million . Same thing for processor speeds . Networks , we did n't have networks at all at the time of the Macintosh's introduction . And that has become the single most salient aspect of how we live with computers .

While a great idea is a reward in and of itself , the NATSO Foundation is going to award $ 500 to the truckstop or travel plaza operator that shares the best great idea during the Great Ideas ! for Independent Operators Session at The NATSO Show 2014 . Tom Heinz , chairman of The NATSO Foundation and president of Coffee Cup Fuel Stop , said he hopes the award will add energy to the already exciting event and also encourage operators to think through their best ideas ahead of time . "" Best ideas are often not immediately quantifiable or are impossible for operators to measure , so they may not realize just how great they are until they take time to think them through , "" he said . "" We want operators or their staff to think about successful things they 're doing and come prepared to share for a chance to win . "" The Great Ideas ! for Independent Operators Session has been designed with independent owners and operators in mind and serves as an interactive platform where operators join together to collaborate and uncover new solutions and business opportunities that can improve their operations . "" Most great ideas take a long time to evolve and they often need to collide with other ideas , which is why the Great Ideas ! Session is the perfect venue for those in the travel plaza industry to find their next best practice , "" Heinz said . "" There are all kinds of little , doable things in our operations that could be made a little bit better , which will make the customers' experiences better , "" Heinz said . "" This session encourages all of us to think through every experience a customer goes",0.0

Eben Sadie : winery profile by Richard Kelley MW It is fitting that Eben ' surfer-philosopher ' Sadie should name his wine after Lucius Junius Moderatus Columella , author of ' De Rustica ' ( ' On Country Matters ' ) , the most comprehensive account of Roman viticulture that dates back two millennia . The wine itself comes from seven different , unirrigated , fully controlled leased parcels across 52km of the Swartland . The area has a remarkably stable climate , allowing for consistent quality albeit with vintage variation . The distinction of Columella is derived from its terroir , the character of the vintage and a very hands off winemaking approach ( more time for surfing , or jetting off to Spain to prune vineyards , or to rack wine in his Priorato venture ) .

Five of the seven parcels are planted with bushvines and each site reflects a different soil profile , encompassing slate ( at Porcelain Mountain ) , coffee stone , an iron rich soil ( Rheeboksfontein ) , and granite ( Aprilskloof ) . To say selection is rigorous is an understatement . The vines are pruned to allow for around 25 hl / ha so as to encourage full phenolic maturity . Picking takes place in the early morning into 15kg lug boxes and refrigerated down to 5 degrees C for 24 hours , when a team of 20 women painstakingly select , often grape by grape , into a final selection bin . These are destemmed and about 50 % are crushed and allowed to cold soak for two to four days . All parcels are vinified separately . Fermentation takes place in open wooden vats with",0.0

Child abuse is an immense problem that does require immediate help provided to the child from the side of specialists . Once a teacher gets an allegation of abuse from a child , he must not require a written statement from the child or must not make the child repeat the allegation in front of other teachers or adult people . The teacher must not wait until the end of the school day , but report immediately by the means of telephone and support it with a written report within the next 36 hours . The teacher takes individual responsibility for the report , so it can not be done anonymously . Both the telephone and the written report are subjects of certain legal procedures . The telephone report should include detailed information about the person making the report and detailed information about the child , suspected of being a victim of abuse : location , special needs , injury , ect . Afterwards all the details must be repeated by the contact person and approved by the reporting teacher . By no means a teacher should contact the child's parents and a teacher should not make an investigation . The next step after the telephone report is the written report . A fax report is an interchangeable form of a written report , required by the "" Department of Children and Family Services "" . The written reports are made through the forms : SS 8572 or SS 8572 ( 2 ) , reporting the fact of child abuse and by the form DOJ 900 , which is a medical report . Copies should be made and saved by the reporter for further organizational process . Generally all the forms if needed are provided by the child protective agency",0.0

However , there are two downsides , one is the sheer amount of hard graft and the other is the expense . Seeds , for starters , cost anything from one to two pounds per packet . I made the mistake of spilling my seed a little too promiscuously with some of the early sowings . I must have planted , for example , around 150 lettuces where there was room for only 15 to grow . That meant throwing away many many seedlings , which seemed like an awful waste . I 've also had to buy planks to build the raised beds , that was a cost of about fifty quid . Then there 's been the wheelbarrow , fork , spade , bamboo canes , bark chipping , black plastic sheeting , Growmore fertiliser , watering cans , sprayer , twine , little plastic pegs for showing you what 's growing where , black plastic sheeting for laying on the paths , bark chippings , gardening books , pencil , weedkiller ( organic ! ) , lime for liming the soil ( whatever that means ) .

I want to open by quoting Einstein's wonderful statement , just so people will feel at ease that the great scientist of the 20th century also agrees with us , and also calls us to this action . He said , "" A human being is a part of the whole , called by us , universe , a part limited in time and space . He experiences himself , his thoughts and feelings , as something separated from the rest , a kind of optical delusion of his consciousness , that separation . This delusion is a kind of prison for us , restricting us to our personal desires and to affection for a few persons nearest to us . Our task must be to free ourselves from this prison by widening our circle of compassion , to embrace all living creatures and the whole of nature in its beauty . "" This insight of Einstein's is uncannily close to that of Buddhist psychology , wherein compassion , karuna , it is called , is defined as , "" The sensitivity to another 's suffering and the corresponding will to free the other from that suffering . "" It pairs closely with love . Which is the will for the other to be happy . Which requires , of course , that one feels some happiness oneself and wishes to share it . This is perfect in that it clearly opposes self-centeredness and selfishness to compassion , the concern for others , and , further , it indicates that those caught in the cycle of self-concern , suffer helplessly , while the compassionate are more free and implicitly more happy . The Dalai Lama often states that compassion is his best friend . It helps him when he is",0.0

A good way to understand reinforcement learning is to consider some of the examples and possible applications that have guided its development : A master chess player makes a move . The choice is informed both by planning---anticipating possible replies and counter-replies---and by immediate , intuitive judgments of the desirability of particular positions and moves . An adaptive controller adjusts parameters of a petroleum refinery's operation in real time . The controller optimizes the yield / cost / quality tradeoff based on specified marginal costs without sticking strictly to the set points originally suggested by human engineers . A gazelle calf struggles to its feet minutes after being born . Half an hour later it is running at 30 miles per hour . A mobile robot decides whether it should enter a new room in search of more trash to collect or start trying to find its way back to its battery recharging station . It makes its decision based on how quickly and easily it has been able to find the recharger in the past . Phil prepares his breakfast . When closely examined , even this apparently mundane activity reveals itself as a complex web of conditional behavior and interlocking goal-subgoal relationships : walking to the cupboard , opening it , selecting a cereal box , then reaching for , grasping , and retrieving the box . Other complex , tuned , interactive sequences of behavior are required to obtain a bowl , spoon , and milk jug . Each step involves a series of eye movements to obtain information and to guide reaching and locomotion .

Posted on Sep 22nd , 2013 . 339800 comments At the Hendrix museum in Seattle , you can see Jimi's famous white Stratocaster , the guitar he played at Woodstock . It 's in a temperature and humidity controlled case , having been purchased for the Experience Music Project by Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen for an undisclosed amount . Around $ 2 million , the Internet rumors say . How much Hendrix valued the guitar is another matter . It was clearly important to him – but it 's also true that Jimi lived in the moment , and his guitars came and went . According to drummer Mitch Mitchell , Hendrix rather casually gave him the White Strat after what would turn out to be his last live performance at the Isle of Fehmarn in September 1970 . Years later , when Mitchell auctioned the guitar at Sotheby's he offered this description : "" Jimi Hendrix was always breaking his guitars and getting new ones but this particular white Fender Stratocaster serial number 240981 was a particular favourite of his . He used it at the Woodstock Festival in August 1969 playing the now famous "" Star Spangled Banner "" on this guitar . I had given him a drum kit as a present some time before and I said to him ' I 'll have that guitar before you break it up ' ( I do not think that he would in fact have broken this particular guitar ) . He said , as was his way ' You got it ' and he then gave me the guitar . In retrospect I think it was by way of a gift as my daughter had just been born a few days previously .

Weight and Body Mass Index A more realistic statistic of how your own body weight compares with general population norms , is an estimate of Body Mass Index ( or BMI ) . This takes into consideration your weight and height ( but not your build ) . You could try the following calculation : Take your weight in Pounds and multiply this by 700 Then divide by your height in Inches Again , divide by your height in Inches The sum is a number representing your BMI If your BMI falls below 20 , than this suggests that you are underweight . If your BMI falls above 27 then this suggests that you are overweight . If your BMI falls below 18 or above 30 then you should speak to your GP about this . For example for a person who weighs 9 stone 7 lbs. ( 133 lbs. ) , and who is 5 feet 5 inches ( 65 inches ) tall 133lbs multiplied by 700 = 93100 Divided by 65 inches = 1432 Divided by 65 inches = a body mass index of 22 ( which falls within the healthy range ) Remember that this calculation gives you only a rough guide to weight in comparison with your height and that there are many other factors which contribute towards maintaining a healthy body weight . If you are concerned about your weight why do n't you make an appointment to see your GP , or visit the Health Centre to see the Practice Nurse or to attend A Well Woman / A Well Man Clinic . You could also visit a counsellor at the Counselling Service to discuss some of your concerns . This page is maintained by the Student Support and Counselling Service </doc>",0.0

Quality control guidelines The CCC grant involves transporting unique primary source materials between the Digital Production Centers of Duke , NCSU , and UNC-Chapel Hill for scanning . In the first few months of the grant , the Production & Materials Management Working Group developed guidelines for performing quality control at each Digital Production Center and workflows for verifying digital files . Below is an outline of the guidelines created for the grant . Duke scanning and postprocessing Scanning Following specific instructions developed for each collection , the scanner operator uses the appropriate equipment , settings and digitization guide to digitize the collection . Benchmark tests are performed and saved during each scanning session . During the capture process the operator monitors the images for quality and file naming errors . The images are saved in a structured way on the local drive and the digitization guide is updated to reflect the completion of an item . At the end of each shift , a DPC staff member moves the images to the DPC server . While the majority of the collection anomalies should be identified and resolved before digitization begins , if the scanner operator encounters an anomaly that is not covered in the scanning guidelines he or she stops digitization and reports the problem to the supervising DPC staff member . Quality Control 1 The Quality Control process is different depending on the scanning device and the nature of the material . Typically , unless automated during capture , the images are manually cropped ( leaving a 50 pixel background margin ) , de-skewed , correctly oriented , and processed at the proper resolution . The operator inspects all images for the correct file name , clipping , banding , blocking , color fidelity , uniform crop ,",0.0

BMW's and Chinese Justice * * * * * In most places , the name "" BMW "" implies luxury and exclusivity . But in China , the brand has unwittingly found itself enmeshed in tales that illustrate the powerlessness of ordinary Chinese against the powerful and corrupt . The first scandal occurred last year , after a tractor filled with green onions scraped the side of a BMW in Harbin . The drivers of both the tractor and the metallic-silver luxury car were 45-year-old women , but any similarity between them ended there : the former was a peasant , the latter the wife of a wealthy businessman . After a confrontation between the two , the wealthy wife drove her BMW into the growing crowd of spectators on the roadside , killing the peasant woman and injuring 12 others . The case went to the local court , where the judge ruled it an "" accidental traffic disturbance "" and gave the driver a two-year suspended sentence . The judge's ruling spurred rumors that he went easy on her because her husband was related to senior provincial officials . It quickly became a story of "" rich versus poor , "" widely cited as an example of high-level corruption . Over the next few months , newspapers and television stations ran with the story as it snowballed into a national obsession . Alarmed by the public reaction , the Harbin magistrate ordered the case reopened , only to have the suspended sentence confirmed when the case was closed this March . The big BMW story of late 2003 resurfaced quietly , before being buried again forever . That same month , a lottery scandal threw the BMW brand into the limelight once again .

Posted on May 6th , 2011 . 0 comments Kirkus Reviews calls Wire to Wire "" A dizzying , speed-laced debut novel ... with plenty of peek-between-your-fingers moments for good measure . "" Including some combustible stuff . Here 's the full review : With Dexedrine-slamming rail riders , a glue-sniffing femme fatale and a lead protagonist whose point of view is skewed under the best of circumstances , the book is a worthy combination of Bob Seger nostalgia and dope-fueled noir , but it 's not always the easiest story to follow . The framing device : video editor Michael Slater's editing suite , where the pill-popping film slicer screens scenes from his own life . Michael has never been quite the same since a peculiar , life-altering incident . While riding on top of a hurtling freight train with his amigo Harp Maitland , a power line zaps the young adventurer with 33,000 volts to the forehead . Now Slater has a head full of holes , and he sometimes sees people who are n't there . From there , it 's a hallucinatory road trip from Arizona to Michigan , which Slater describes in loving detail . It 's a blistered postcard of passing Americana , stitched together with diners , pool halls and pickup trucks , not to mention the freight trains that Sparling himself rode . Technically , it 's a crime novel – there 's violence and sex and things on fire . But it 's obvious that the author is more interested in what 's bouncing around in his hero's fractured head and spilling it out onto the page than he is in tidy endings .

In July 1957 British Prime Minister Harold Macmillan told fellow Conservatives at a rally in Bedford , England , that "" most of our people have never had it so good . "" The generation of novelists , playwrights , directors , and filmmakers who became known as the "" Angry Young Men "" could n't have disagreed more . From the mid-1950s to the early 1960s , they produced a body of arresting work that was grounded in the "" kitchen sink "" reality of working-class life , railed against the class-conscious British social order , and reflected the alienated , rebellious , and pessimistic mood of many in post-World War II Britain . Here are 10 of the most prominent figures in that cantankerous lot . Woodfall Film Productions Charles Lumley , the protagonist of John Wain ' s novel Hurry on Down ( 1953 ) , a recent university graduate with contempt for the conformity of his privileged class , and Jim Dixon , the antihero of Kingsley Amis ' s comic classic Lucky Jim ( 1954 ) , who has risen from a modest background to the relatively cushy post of university lecturer , are often cited as precursors , but the ur-Angry Young Man ( AYM ) was Jimmy Porter , the furious focus of John Osborne's play Look Back in Anger ( 1956 ) . First played onstage by Kenneth Haigh and on film by Richard Burton , trumpet-playing Jimmy is a bilious but articulate working-class lad whose university degree has landed him a job as the proprietor of a sweet stand in a market . His rage against class-based oppression and pretension is most often sadistically directed at his wife ( whom he calls "" Lady Pusillanimous "" ) and her upper-middle-class family",0.0

NASA / TRACE / SMEX A transit is when one astronomical body passes in front of another . When Johannes Kepler was preparing tables of celestial events and planetary positions for the years 1629 to 1636 , he paid special attention to any possible transits of Mercury and Venus in front of the Sun . With the invention of the telescope , Kepler believed it would be possible to definitively observe a planetary transit . He calculated a Mercury transit for November 7 , 1631 . Kepler was not too sure about his calculations , so he urged astronomers to also observe both the day before and the day after . Kepler died on November 15 , 1630 . The next November astronomers eagerly awaited the transit . There was poor weather in Europe , so only a handful of astronomers saw the transit . About 9 AM on the 7th , just a few hours off from Kepler's prediction , a small spot started to move across the Sun . All who saw it thought it was a sunspot at first , because the then-accepted size of Mercury was much larger than reality . However , ideas about the size of Mercury ( and the other planets ) predated the telescope . The scale of things in the solar system changed that day . From Kepler's time on , the orbit of Mercury was determined more precisely . With Newton's law of gravitation , the orbits of the planets were explained . After the discovery of Uranus in 1781 , discrepancies in its orbit led to the prediction and discovery of Neptune in 1846 . French astronomer Urbain-Jean-Joseph Le Verrier began work on the Uranus problem in 1845 , and on September 23 , 1846 , he asked Johann",0.0

Man Booker prize shortlist 2016 : Eileen by Ottessa Moshfegh is wickedly suspenseful – review Ingenious narration and a sinister air distinguish Ottessa Moshfegh's brilliant novel Eileen , says Anthony Cummins P erverse , squalid and sinister , this expertly paced novel – the first British outing for a rising star from the United States – spends so much time hinting at the past crimes of its outsider heroine that I felt sure the eventual "" reveal "" would be an anticlimax . And that 's exactly where Ottessa Moshfegh wants you : softened up and ready to be knocked flat by a narrative left turn of gut-curdling horror . The time is 1964 , the place a sleepy Boston suburb where dowdy prison clerk Eileen Dunlop lives with her father , a gin-soaked , paranoid ex-cop . Hooked on laxatives , refusing to wash , with a dead mouse deliberately preserved in the glove compartment of her car , she 's got troubles of her own . But while her brain boils with vengeful fantasies of suicide and murder , most people notice only an acne-ridden girl wearing a shabby coat held together with tape . Hooked on laxatives , refusing to wash , with a dead mouse deliberately preserved in the glove compartment of her car , Eileen's got troubles of her own E ileen pins hopes of deliverance from the frustrations of her life on the beefy prison guard she stalks at weekends . But then a new colleague arrives : Rebecca , a glamorous Harvard graduate hired to teach the young inmates . The novel tells the story of why , days after Rebecca's arrival , Eileen flees , never to return . "" Let me make this clear : I was not a lesbian ,",0.0

Orpheus Gustave Moreau drew much attention when he painted Orpheus in 1865 . The intriguing composition regards the famous Greek legend of Orpheus , a poet and musician so talented that he was believed to be able to charm beasts into submission . Moreau , known for his wild imagination , created a unique ending to the myth , and depicted it on canvas . The story goes that when Orpheus charmed the maenads , ( seductive female followers of the god of wine ) , and then refused their advances , they tore him apart and threw his head and lyre into a nearby stream . While most artists chose to paint the horrific events of the raging women murdering Orpheus , Gustave Moreau opted to depict his personal idea of what happened after the tragic slaying . He includes a young girl dressed in delicate oriental garments who , after having salvaged Orpheuss decapitated head and lyre from the stream , lovingly stares at it with a sad facial expression that could signify regret or pity . The similarity of the two faces not only captivates viewers with its eeriness , but it also has them questioning the artists intention . This likeness may be symbolic in nature , but Moreau offers no explanation and leaves its interpretation to the onlookers imagination . The paintings sombre background is meticulously detailed , and harmonizes with the mystical mood of the painting . The composition is diagonally in sync ; the musicians at the top left of the canvas are balanced by the two turtles at the bottom right .

Application-level fault-tolerance is a sub-class of software fault-tolerance that focuses on the problems of expressing the problems and solutions of fault-tolerance in the top layer of the hierarchy of virtual machines that constitutes our computers . This book shows that application-level fault-tolerance is a key ingredient to craft truly dependable computer systems – other approaches , such as hardware fault-tolerance , operating system fault-tolerance , or fault-tolerant middleware , are also important ingredients to achieve resiliency , but they are not enough . <font color = purple>Failing</font> to address the application layer means leaving a backdoor open to problems such as design faults , interaction faults , or malicious attacks , whose consequences on the quality of service could be as unfortunate as , e.g. , a physical fault affecting the system platform . In other words , in most cases it is simply not possible to achieve complete coverage against a given set of faults or erroneous conditions without embedding fault-tolerance provisions also in the application layer . In what follows the provisions for application-level fault-tolerance are called application-level fault-tolerance protocols . As a lecturer in this area , I wrote this book as my ideal textbook for a possible course on resilient computing and for my doctoral students in software dependability at the University of Antwerp .

DIY Tire Mounting & Balancing – a Realistic Option ? Dave Gran Race Tires While I do n't exactly enjoy spending money on tire purchases , at least I feel like I 'm getting something for what I 'm spending . Paying a shop between $ 100 and $ 120 to mount and balance each set of tires ? That just frustrates me ! Considering how often many of us racers need race tires mounted and balanced , this becomes expensive quickly . There 's got to be a better way . Tire Mounting : I first looked into manual tire mounting machines such as the Roger Kraus System which retails for $ 565 plus shipping . My online searches did n't produce any used units available and from what I saw when used ones do go on sale , they go quickly and tend to hold their value . I spoke with the company for a bit and it sounded like it might work . My concern is that the Hoosier tires I use are even a challenge to the experienced guys who work at tire shops . ( I put a 225 wide tire on a 6 '' wide rim . ) When talking with them about this concern , they said that it does take some time to get the technique down . If you 've read any of our garage adventure articles , you 'll quickly realize that maybe this is n't the ideal solution for us . I know what you maybe thinking – I wish they tried it and captured the mayhem on video ! Then I began looking at pneumatic tire mounting machines . I found a used one from a shop that had closed down , but later realized that this was",0.0

To get ready for the workshop , I 'm making a list of things I want to address . Here 's what 's on it so far : Dialogue as story information – exceptions where it works How many people in a scene can talk ? Situations where no one should talk Sometime in the next ten days , I 'll get an outline together to make sense of all that .

In producing a signlist and analysing its contents , it is obviously very important to consider the question of what actually constitutes a "" sign "" . Much has changed since the traditional Assyriological signlists were first produced , both in Assyriology and in the description and analysis of writing and writing systems in general . The minimal unit of written language - and this applies equally to logo-syllabic scripts such as cuneiform as it does to alphabetic scripts - is the grapheme . One might describe this as the smallest contrastive unit of writing . By substituting one such unit for another , a significant change in meaning ( using the term in its broad sense ) occurs . Grapheme is not an unproblematic term ( notice , for instance , that there is no one-to-one relationship between graphemes and phonemes ) but it is both defensible and useful , as far as the present study of cuneiform is concerned , at least . There are many and various indications of what ancient scribes considered units in cuneiform ; in light of these , a set of criteria is being drawn up to allow the identification of signs . The CDP project will catalogue and analyse these units , these graphemes . Thus for the signlist , the sign is a grapheme . There are two further levels at which cuneiform signs can be described . Graphemes may appear in several different , yet equally valid , forms ; these are labelled allographs . Each instance - the actual mark or set of marks one sees in the clay - is an example of an allograph of a grapheme ; these are labelled graphs . To illustrate the difference between graph , allograph and grapheme , consider alphabetic writing",0.0

Ms. Europe or Frau Germania ? BERLIN – Just what is the matter with Angela Merkel ? Only a short while ago , she was celebrated as "" Ms. Europe "" ; now , she increasingly gives the impression of being Frau Germania . Instead of providing resolute leadership in the global financial and economic crisis , the European Union's largest economy is withdrawing into its shell . Germany has always been the motor of European integration , in accordance with its political and economic interests . Every post-World War II government has always been willing to harness Germany's financial strength to further that aim , i . e . , to foot the bill for Europe . The motto was simple : Germany gives and profits in turn . Should Germany spurn the first part of this formula , the European project would suffer serious damage – and so will German national interests . Yet this is the direction in which Chancellor Merkel seems to be heading . Indeed , in the wake of the Greek crisis , Merkel spoke publicly of the need to be able to exclude eurozone members that do not play by the rules . Does she seriously believe that the euro and the EU would survive such punitive action ? Instead of ideas for strengthening the solidarity and stability of the eurozone , absurd proposals are floated in Berlin . The idea that Germany would show financial solidarity with weakened eurozone members only if they accept draconian stabilization measures is similarly unrealistic . Such measures would only exacerbate deflation in these countries , which are the most important markets for German exports . What is essential is the right combination of stability and financial aid , even if the latter is unpopular with the",0.0

And the way they <font color = red>perceive</font> it depends on the teacher's personal particularities that are transmitted to children through interaction and the knowledge that the teacher offers them . A good teacher is a person who finds individual approach to every pupil , taking care about the child's adaptation in class , increasing one's social status in class and making sure the children learn to take into account and respect the thoughts of other people .

Residents and businesses in the Powys part of the Dyfi Valley are being invited to help create an action plan that will improve the quality of life and vitality of the area . Each of the four public events planned for July will focus on a specific theme and will bring together the two community organisations that have been researching local needs . Each meeting will also discuss the relevant section of the draft Powys Community Strategy . The Communities First process in Machynlleth , Cadfarch , Glantwymyn and Llanbrynmair is entering a new phase . A lot of suggestions concerning the future of the Dyfi valley have been gathered during the community consultations . Equally , many people in the same area have contributed their ideas during the events organised by the Local Community Forum ( part of the community strategy process in Powys ) . Andy Rowland is the Chair of the Forum . "" All these ideas have been sorted into a number of themes "" , he explained , "" but now we need to turn them into a draft action plan for the area . "" This means deciding which ones will make a real difference , who will bring them about and how soon , as well as seeing what kind of vision they add up to .

Mike Rawalt began RRR Enterprises in January of 1991 as a sideline to supplement Mike's Army pension . You see , Mike had just retired from an Army career in August of 1990 and along with his wife Barbara , had just completed building their log home in Delta Junction , Alaska , which is located 100 miles SE of Fairbanks at the official end of the ALCAN Highway . RRR Enterprises began selling , servicing & installing SNO-WAY Plows , added the Ariens line of snow-blowers , then began custom manufacturing small ATV trailers called "" Meatwagons "" in one half of their large attached garage . You can probably guess that it was n't very long before Barb's complaints of the noise , dust , welding fumes , etc. , that found their way into the house , required immediate action on Mike's part . Before another construction season passed , Mike had the new shop up and running . In fact , he had to turn down business just so the shop could be completed before moose hunting . Now if you have ever built a shop or garage you know that it does n't take very long to realize you should have built it larger , right ? But then after all , how much space do you need to custom build trailers one at a time ? With an increasing desire to see more of their two sons & now six grandkids in Anchorage ( 350 miles south west ) and after a few years praying about relocating , the decision was made in the spring of 2005 . Trailer manufacturing ended so the preparations for selling and moving could begin . Mike continues to sell his trailer plans through the RRR web site (",0.0

Fitting - Sizes - Models : PHN 's come in two models . The smaller UltraLight , and the larger FullSize . There are no "" sizes "" such as one finds when trying on shoes . The type of hat is the determining factor , not the size of the head . Nets are fitted to drape nicely , and protect a full sized adult . When compared to the different size-shape of net required to cover a full size hat vs a baseball cap , the size differential of nets for smaller vs larger people is quite minimal . Many hundreds of PHN's are out there , and so far we 've yet to run across the individual with a noggin so small or so huge that net size is an issue . A 6 ' man has roughly the same size head as a 5 ' woman . Thankfully , our heads are not like her size 6 vs his size 15 feet , and so we enjoy a confidence in PHN's appropriate fit that 's well proven over time . the UltraLight - This is our original head net .

Apichatpong Weerasethakul : The Serenity of Madness , reviewed by Adeline Chia / ArtReview Apichatpong Weerasethakul : The Serenity of Madness Adeline Chia reviews the Thai artist's first retrospective in his homeland , in Chiang Mai's brand new museum Maiiam Museum of Contemporary Art , Chiang Mai , 4 July – 10 September 2016 If anyone can make you lose your mind in a relaxing way , it 's Apichatpong Weerasethakul . Memories , ghosts , reincarnation , Thai history and a reality-loosening , faculty-scrambling sense of joy and wonderment come together so sweetly in this midcareer survey of the critically acclaimed filmmaker's short films and video installations that the experience is , as the title suggests , a kind of safe letting go . Cynics would look at the content and say that it 's more of the same , but when the same 's so good , can you bring yourself to complain ? The Serenity of Madness brings together the ' gallery work ' of the Thai auteur best known for the Palme d ' Or-winning Uncle Boonmee Who Can Recall His Past Lives ( 2010 ) . Over the years , he 's built up a reputation on both the film-festival and biennial circuits , but his output for the latter remains scattered and unconsolidated , and often portrayed as the interesting but poorer cousin of his movie career . Hopefully , this exhibition will provide some corrective reimagining of the relation-ship between the two halves of his life . Another artist-filmmaker , Steve McQueen , once said his work was ' all one thing , as if film was the novel and visual art is poetry ' ; Weerasethakul's pieces have a similar kinship .

LIVING THE SPIRIT OF PENTECOST It is said that the events of September 11 2001 changed the world forever . Certainly the world feels to me a less safe place to be . In our anger , our confusion and our despair - where was God ? In our grief , our helplessness , perhaps even our desire for revenge - where was God to be found ? For many God seemed absent . But for many more , God was very present . In our confusion and our tears we were drawn together across denominations and Faiths , to celebrate the presence of a God who walks with us , suffers with us and pours out hope . For if the idea of the world as a global community is to mean anything , it forces us to recognise that we live connected with the deepest griefs of humankind . What affected the peoples of America affected us too . We care because God cares passionately . We weep because God weeps . We pray because God prays too . When we recognise and experience our connections with each other we touch the love and the grace of God . We know each other as graced and blessed to the extent that we become points of grace and blessing for each other . More than that , we set free the divine grace that transforms despair and gives wings to hope . To recognise and to experience God's connective love and grace between peoples across the world and throughout history is to live the Spirit of Pentecost . For the Holy Spirit is the source of all connectedness . It is the Spirit who invites us again and yet again to be co-workers with God . It is the",1.0

A eulogy of the Soviet Union would read that the 74-year-old superpower succumbed to a prolonged illness on December 31 , 1991 . During its final months , increasingly desperate measures were used in an attempt to stave off the demise of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics , but these served only to delay the inevitable . The bureaucratic structures that had governed one-sixth of Earth's landmass crumbled , and a succession of former Soviet republics declared their independence . The Baltic states of Estonia , Latvia , and Lithuania became independent in September , and the sovereignty of Ukraine was confirmed via plebiscite in December . Although the Commonwealth of Independent States ( CIS ) was intended to serve as something of a successor to the Soviet Union , the bulk of the Soviet state's geopolitical weight – as well as its nuclear arsenal – shifted to Russia . On December 25 Mikhail Gorbachev resigned as Soviet president , and six days later the U.S.S.R. ceased to exist . The Cold War had largely defined international relations in the latter half of the 20th century , but despite the ever-present threat of nuclear war , there existed a degree of stability . Although the arsenals controlled by Moscow and Washington , D.C. , were capable of destroying the world many times over , the promise of mutually assured destruction meant that cooler heads prevailed , even in tense confrontations such as the Cuban missile crisis . The détente that had prevailed through the 1970s ended abruptly with the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in December 1979 , and the subsequent quagmire hastened the decline of the Soviet empire and provided a fertile breeding ground for the Taliban and al-Qaeda . As casualties mounted in Afghanistan , the Soviet government",1.0

Ebbers was not a detached , unknowing chief executive Financial Services Committee spokeswoman Peggy Peterson An email sent on 18 March informed former chief executive Bernard Ebbers and former chief financial officer Scott Sullivan of concerns about accounting issues related to the preparation of WorldCom's annual report , the US House Financial Services Committee said . During the same month , Salomon Smith Barney's former telecoms analyst , Jack Grubman , warned Mr Sullivan that his firm was dropping WorldCom from a list of recommended shares before the information was released to investors . In an email sent on 12 March , Mr Grubman insisted that he had not been the one responsible for removing the firm from the list . "" This is our strategist , not us . Which is why I hate ever having a name on that list , "" Mr Grubman said in the email . In the know Mr Grubman's warning was forwarded by Mr Sullivan to his boss , Mr Ebbers , the investigators said . Mr Sullivan could be sent to prison for 65 years A third email which was sent in May revealed that Mr Sullivan had tried to brush off an inquiry from the credit rating agency Moody's Investors Service .

THE QUESTION IN SCOTLAND FIFTY YEARS AGO . I. One of my earliest recollections is the rattle of the muskets when a company of soldiers , marched into Easter Ross to keep down the excited population in 1843 , grounded their arms in the High Street of the old burgh of Tain . They were drawn up in front of the grey tower on the Castle hill , which half hid the long blue line of Sutherlandshire hills , while far to the right our horizon showed the ruined Keep of Lochslin , the birthplace of the Bloody Mackenzie . It was the centre of a district in which the display of some military force had become necessary . About a year before , the Church of Scotland had solemnly undertaken to disestablish itself ; and that promise had now to be fulfilled , but by a very different process from the comfortable euthanasia of retaining a life-interest in the benefices . Most of the Northern ministers adhered to their pledge ; but each of them still held that the church of the parish belonged to its congregation , and the congregations ( who were with them almost unanimously ) held still more strongly that the manse ought to be left with the outgoing minister . That was not to be . It was found not easy to drive the Gaelic congregations from the low grey walls of the Easter Ross churches , each surrounded by the generations of its dead . And though it was easy enough to send out from his home each minister and his family , the actual accomplishment of this , which was now going on , filled every household in the Highlands with a dangerous mixture of anguish and indignation .

This may vary from vendor to vendor , but NSS has n't tested the capabilities of these devices to "" learn "" the networks they 're installed in without manual intervention . The recommendation has always been to install them in a passive monitoring mode , watch what they alert on , and then have custom exclusions written for unique applications . NGFWs do not natively include the ability to ' self-learn ' the behavior of custom apps . It requires manual intervention to identify the unknown application traffic in order for the NGFW to properly identify and manage the application . What impact will the trend of social media webpages like Facebook moving towards https have on the ability to block "" specific "" traffic or traffic patterns ? You will need SSL interception capabilities on your NGFW . The most common problem in this type of implementation is to manage the whitelist / blacklist sites . For regulatory reasons corporations do not want to intercept SSL connections to employee benefits / payroll / personal banking sites . Many organizations now require secure file transfers ( SFTP or FTPS ) ... how can a next-gen firewall inspect that traffic if the data is encrypted ? Absolutely . One reason why you do n't hear much from most NGFW vendors about IPv6 is that they have not built in the dual-stack support and feature & performance parity necessary to provide the same level protection for IPv6 as they deliver for IPv4 traffic . In other words , they hope you do n't have a requirement to support IPv6 because they ca n't support it today . Why this is an issue is threefold : You likely have IPv6 traffic in your network whether you know it or not . Many",1.0

Excellent portrayal of the social gap between the less fortunate ( beggar ) , and the more affluent , ( father with children ) , in just 5 minutes .

Green MEP Calls for Climate Change ' Revolution ' 30th Jun 2005 Top Green challenges Bush and Blair at alternative G8 Summit WORLD leaders gathering in Gleneagles next week must embrace a ' climate change revolution ' and slash military spending if they hope to make real progress on tackling extreme poverty in Africa , according to Euro-MP Caroline Lucas . The South-East England MEP and Green Party principal speaker will make her comments during an alternative G8 counter-summit at venues around Edinburgh next Sunday ( July 3rd ) . "" Tony Blair has promised to make tackling climate change and extreme poverty in Africa his two priorities during his presidency of the G8 , "" she will say at the ' G8 Corporate dream ... Global Nightmare ' conference . "" But if he is to have any success he will have to accept - and persuade George Bush and other G8 leaders to accept - that these challenges are simply different sides of the same coin . "" Both extreme poverty in the developing world and runaway greenhouse gas emissions which are fuelling climate change - which Tony Blair has himself describes as ' the greatest threat we face ' - are inevitable consequences of the G8 countries' relentless pursuit of ever freer international trade and economic globalisation . "" If the G8 leaders are serious about tackling these problems they will have to accept that social and environmental protection require stepping back from the goal of forcing open ever-more developing markets to unfettered free trade - and replacing their goal of increased economic growth with the pursuit of increased economic , social and environmental security . "" Dr Lucas will join a roll-call of green and progressive thinkers - including George Monbiot , Trevor Ngwame , Walden",1.0

Supervisors : Mustafa BA Djamgoz and Suzanne Eccles Project : Cellular and molecular biophysics of angiogenesis Angiogenesis ( the formation of new blood vasculature ) is a biological process of fundamental importance both during development and in a variety of pathological situations - in particular the growth and spread of cancers . Although angiogenesis is a complex process , involving a variety of activating molecular signals , it incorporates an integrated series of basic cell behaviours , such as cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesion , motility , invasion protease secretion , and tubular differentiation . It is clear that activated endothelial cells responding to angiogenic stimuli share many common downstream signalling pathways and functions with invasive cancer cells , and these can be exploited as therapeutic targets ( Eccles 2004 ) . We have provided substantial evidence that the invasive potential of several types of cancer ( prostate , breast and leukaemia ) are potentiated by voltage-gated sodium channel ( VGSC ) expression and / or activity . Importantly , we now have promising new evidence that human endothelial ( blood vessel ) cells also express electrophysiologically-detectable VGSCs and that their activity controls formation of vessels ( ' tubules ' ) as well as their invasive capability . In addition , at least one type of VGSC is induced by hypoxia ( low oxygen levels ) . Hypoxia within tumours is one of the key drivers of angiogenesis and invasion . These findings raise the possibility that VGSC blockers may effectively inhibit the progressive growth and spread of cancers . This project will use cellular and molecular biophysical techniques to further characterize VGSC expression , activation and regulation in human endothelial cells and to elucidate the contribution of VGSC activity to tumour angiogenesis . </doc>",1.0

Upper-class reformers These people feared that without change there might be a revolution .

The banker Thomas Attwood founded the Birmingham Political Union in 1829 . The purpose was to campaign for change . In 1832 it had 25,000 members . Most wanted the vote for other middle-class people – not necessarily the poor . Working-class reformers Some political unions wanted the vote for all men . Many working-class people realised to get change – say the better working conditions , they needed Parliaments help . Parliament did not represent their concerns .

I kept my adab ( one must have kept good manners ) and walked up to the crowd . Then the crowed opened up like the sea opened for Musa . a . s. I gave my salaams .

Terrain reconstruction and sub-surface modeling over archaeological sites , using geophysical prospection data . Geophysical survey data from archaeological sites is now widely used in prospecting and evaluating archaeological sites prior to more detailed investigation such as excavation . Visual inspection of geophysical data can reveal much about the organizational structure , form and extent of the archaeological site . However , information contained in such images potentially contains a rich , currently untapped , source of information about the physical nature and depth of buildings and ditch structures . To access this information requires application of reconstruction and modeling methods to able to build a realistic 3-dimensional model of the sub-surface features . Such modeling from geophysical images would provide the next generation of archaeologists with detailed structural information prior to potential excavation . A substantive part of this will include utilization of new image-processing reconstruction techniques , with ground-truth data from physical properties of site materials . The student undertaking this research should have a numerate background in a physical science , good mathematical ability and experience of programming ( or willingness to learn ) .

Kingsbridge is actually made up of three distinct neighborhoods : Kingsbridge proper , Kingsbridge Heights , and Van Cortlandt Village . The neighborhood is considered a part of Bronx Community Board 8 , and is sometimes considered a sub-section of Riverdale , since it shares the same zip code 10463 with Riverdale . Kingsbridge proper's ill-defined boundaries are Van Cortlandt Park to the north , Bailey Avenue to the east , West 230st Street to the south , and Broadway to the west . Kingsbridge is patrolled by the New York City Police Department ' s 50th Precinct . Contents Kingsbridge has detached , semi detached , and attached homes , and Broadway has apartment buildings where many Dominicans reside . Streets connecting Riverdale and Kingsbridge include "" step streets "" , with stairways of as many as 160 steps climbing the slope . Some jokingly refer to Riverdale as the "" rich uncle "" of Kingsbridge which has its origins during the Irish period . The neighborhood is also part of a business improvement district that is home to 200 merchants , which is one of the largest retail shopping districts in the Bronx . River Plaza Shopping Center is located nearby ( in Marble Hill , Manhattan ) but it is not part of the business improvement district . During the past several years there have been significant improvements in the infrastructure of the community .

Long before "" sustainable "" and "" environmentally friendly "" became public statements , the professionals already knew all about the energy-saving possibilities of a well designed home . Unfortunately , they were often forced to conform to "" houses must face the street "" , rooms had to conform to what worked in the past rather than what was best for local conditions . Because of this many structures are not in line with today's standards of sustainability . Across Australia , and in some other countries in the world , new houses and renos are required by law to provide minimum standards of energy efficiency . While these laws vary from state to state , country to country , all require a 4-star or 5-star energy efficiency rating . The homebuyer then has to decide on whether to pay out the extra cash at construction , or have regular and continuing savings in the future . The critical component in sustainable design is the building's orientation on the land . Not only the direction the house faces but particularly way the windows are facing . In small buildings ( houses ) orientation allows the proper control of summer and winter heat loads which penetrate through a building's outer shell . Research needs to be done on movement of sun , slope of land , prevailing breezes , existing trees and vegetation and any other special characteristics in each individual state / territory . Different climate zones within the area must also be taken into consideration . Strategies for the tropics are different to those in temperate or alpine areas . In the southern hemisphere , ideally the longest axis for the home should run east to west , with living areas facing north . North-facing rooms accumulate winter",1.0

This diminishing brand loyalty is brought to life in analysis of today's shopping journeys : consumers often abandon a cart – especially online – due to poor site navigation and subpar experiences , according to research from the e-tailing group and MyBuys . As many as 33 % of respondents said they left a web site because they found it difficult to browse for products . Once consumers exited a retailer's e-Commerce site , they typically visited Amazon ( 42 % ) and Google ( 60 % ) to research the same purchases . The Emergence Of Omnichannel Personalization To combat consumers' high expectations and short attention spans , retailers must ensure they provide the best possible experience by delivering seamless and consistent messaging , pricing , offers and content across all channels . In addition , retailers should work to make brand interactions personalized and tailored to the unique wants and needs of every one of these demanding customers . "" Without an integrated , omnichannel operation , personalization remains a siloed , channel-specific experience , "" said Deena Amato-McCoy , Research Analyst for the retail branch of Aberdeen Group .

The service was to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the ceasefire in the Suez canal zone . A spokesman said the veterans had commented on the anniversary's importance and recognising the service of their comrades . The military was sent to Egypt to defend British interests in the Suez Canal , an important shipping link . The military was sent to Egypt to defend British interests in the Suez Canal in 1951 . The canal , which runs through Egypt , remains an important shipping link between Africa and Asia , and Britain at the time already had a military presence in the area . But tensions with Egypt and a rise in nationalism in the area led to the declaration of an emergency period until 1954 and military action , by Israel , Britain and France began in 1956 as they tried to maintain Western control .

France and Germany Must Act in Iraq Next week , President Bush , President Chirac , and Chancellor Schroeder will meet on the cliffs of Normandy to mark the 60th anniversary of the D-Day invasions that led to the liberation of Europe . They should also seize the moment to liberate themselves from the bitterness that has divided the Atlantic Alliance over the Iraq War , argue Pierre Lellouche and Christoph Bertram . When the United States launched the war against Saddam Hussein's Iraq , France and Germany rightly warned that the invasion could well end up worsening instability in the Middle East and increase the threat of radical Islamic terror . But now that America and its coalition have proven themselves to be incapable of bringing stability to Iraq on their own , the French and German governments can no longer rest and smugly say , "" I told you so , "" as the situation deteriorates even further . Both governments must now become seriously and fully engaged in what must now be a united Western effort . Of course , it would be best for everyone - France and Germany included - if the current US-led coalition were to succeed and Iraq could turn into a pillar of Middle East stability and modernization . Yet , however desirable this outcome , it is no longer likely ( if it ever was ) . Internal stability and economic recovery continue to be elusive , with the specter of civil war hovering ever closer . A divided Iraq at war with itself would be a disaster for the region , for America's international credibility and authority , and for transatlantic relations . In an already fragile region , a major Arab country like Iraq would most likely prompt interventions",1.0

Have you heard about Form-Based Codes - New Zoning Tool to be Utilized with Plan Build Live Cincinnati's great neighborhoods originally were built as pedestrian-oriented , mixed-use communities . Residents could walk to restaurants , groceries , retail and meet their daily needs in their vibrant neighborhood business districts . Originally zoning focused on the quality of the places we designed and built and not solely on specific uses , as current zoning does . A major focus of the Plan Build Live project is the creation of a powerful new zoning tool called a Form - Based Code . Form-Based Codes reinforce strong neighborhoods , business districts , and downtowns by focusing on the physical character of buildings , and the relationship of buildings to each other and to the street . By concentrating on the form , rather than the use , of buildings , form-based codes also address the streets and sidewalks – the ' public living rooms ' of our neighborhoods . Most traditional zoning codes are auto-oriented and produce patches of similar use , forcing long distances between the things we all need to do . Many of Cincinnati's walkable , mixed-use neighborhood business districts would not be able to built today under traditional zoning . Form based codes are a powerful new tool that will permit neighborhoods to reinforce their character and their competitive advantage by once again concentrating on the physical massing of buildings , the relationship of the buildings to the sidewalks and street , and the character of the community . The vision and hope of every neighborhood to be a vibrant place where all residents can live , work and play is made possible through the adoption of a form-based code .

News & Events news Waiting list relief for Scottish patients Waiting times to see a specialist about hearing problems have been slashed in the Lothians after hundreds of thousands of pounds were spent on new testing rooms . Deaf and hard of hearing patients now wait an average of around seven months to see an audiologist and have a hearing aid fitted - down from more than 18 months two years ago . Waiting times are set to fall even further with the appointment of a further six audiologists at the Ear , Nose and Throat ( ENT ) department at Lauriston Place . But the latest figures still fall three weeks short of the Scottish Executive's target of 26 weeks , which came into force in March this year . Nanette Milne , health spokeswoman for the Scottish Tories , said : "" It is very good news for people in Edinburgh and the Lothians that waiting times have already been reduced and that new audiologists have been appointed . "" I am not too concerned about Executive waiting times , as long as the needs of patients are being met and the fact that the wait has been cut by so much is fantastic . "" She added : "" I know waiting lists in audiology have meant people have been waiting a terribly long time to have hearing aids fitted . "" The new permanent staff will replace locums who are currently carrying out the work , saving NHS Lothian £ 180,000 a year . Two have already started work , and the others are set to begin soon . Some of them will later be moved to the audiology department at St John's Hospital , Livingston . In February , the health authority spent £ 470,000",1.0

Recorder players are most likely to be familiar with Robin Walker's A Book of Song and Dance ( both the edition published by Forsyth Brothers and a recording of the collection have been reviewed in The Recorder Magazine ) pieces from which have been included in grade exam syllabuses . This CD provides an opportunity to hear two more of Walker's recorder pieces together with a selection of other instrumental works composed during the last twenty years . Mr Gilbert dines at the Modern Hindu Hotel for descant recorder and piano was composed in 1994 to celebrate composer Anthony Gilbert's 60th birthday . Lasting a little under three minutes and certainly an occasional piece , it is nevertheless a significant work , exploring textures and sonorities found also in Rite in A Book of Song and Dance composed at around the same time . His Master's Voice for sopranino recorder and piano was written in 2001 for Walker's composition teacher David Lumsdain on his 70th birthday . It proceeds in alternate calm and energetic sections that achieve further contrast by setting the recorder very effectively against the piano's higher and lower registers . This and the above are two recorder works striking in their originality that leave you eager to hear more of walker's work for the instrument . His years as a chorister in York Minster under the direction of Francis Jackson clearly gave Walker a strong sense of organ sonorities that is very evident in two impressive works for the instrument , Dances with Chant and Chorales and Invention . The earliest composition on the disc is Dance / Still for the unusual ensemble of flute , clarinet , violin , cello , guitar and percussion ( two players ) written in 1982 . Here , the influence",1.0

Synopsis Padmé Amidala , former queen of the planet Naboo , comes to the city-world of Coruscant to take her seat in the senate of the Republic . She becomes the target of an assassination attempt , and the Jedi knight Obi-Wan Kenobi and his apprentice Anakin Skywalker are assigned to protect her .

S. M. Bowes Time Traveler The great Albert Einstein theorized that time travel was possible by bending time and space via the means of gravitational forces . I 'd invented a time machine using his principal . Most believe that we can travel back in time , but this is not possible . The device would not have been invented ; ergo - one could not travel back further than when the machine had been invented . One could not alter history in any way . But what of the future ? Since we are weak species and seek power over those who are of a meek nature , we tend to destroy what we can not dominate . I have been to the future and have witnessed what one person had done to bring about the end of the human race . But I am getting ahead of myself . I must start at the beginning . My name is Harlen Davidson . I am a peaceful person . I could never tolerate war and longed to find a way to prevent it . I 'd invented my time machine specificlly for that purpose . After many years of trial and error I had finally perfected a machine that could travel through the dimensions of time and space . I was at the point where I could put it though the ultimate test by sending a guinea pig into the future . The guinea pig being me , of course . I would not allow another being to risk their life . The date was January 12th 2018 . I 'd decided that this was the hour I would venture into the future . I was very excited , but a little anxious about what mankind had achieved .",1.0

The biosynthesis of disaccharides , oligosaccharides and polysaccharides involves the action of hundreds of different glycosyltransferases . These are enzymes that catalyse the transfer of sugar moieties from activated donor molecules to specific acceptor molecules , forming glycosidic bonds . A classification of glycosyltransferases using nucleotide diphospho-sugar , nucleotide monophospho-sugar and sugar phosphates ( 2 . 4 . 1 . - ) and related proteins into distinct sequence based families has been described [ 1 ] . This classification is available on the CAZy ( CArbohydrate-Active EnZymes ) web site [ 2 ] . The same three-dimensional fold is expected to occur within each of the families . Because 3-D structures are better conserved than sequences , several of the families defined on the basis of sequence similarities may have similar 3-D structures and therefore form ' clans ' . Glycosyltransferase family 28 GT_28 comprises enzymes with a number of known activities ; 1 , 2-diacylglycerol 3-beta-galactosyltransferase ( 2 . 4 . 1 . 46 ) ; 1 , 2-diacylglycerol 3-beta-glucosyltransferase ( 2 . 4 . 1 . 157 ) ; beta-N-acetylglucosamine transferase ( 2 . 4 . 1 . - ) .

The report , entitled ' Transitions ' , includes not only some startling research results concerning suicide rates , using ASBOs inefficiently and the cost to the state of failing young people and not bringing them back into the workforce , but also some details of the measures to be taken by a cross - Governmental action . And a government minister spoke about the report as a necessary document given the new and difficult environment facing young people in this transition today . Generation Gap The Minister of State responsible for the SEU and Local Government , Mr. Phil Woolas MP , spoke of the need to recognise the change that society as a whole has undergone and the consequences of this , saying : ' For my generation - and my parents' generation - the transition from adolescence to adulthood was relatively straightforward : leave school , get a job , leave mum and dad's home , get married , start a family .

Booth's poverty notebooks For each of London's streets , Booth extracted information from the detailed record sheets kept by the small army of attendance officers employed by the London School Board . He and eight collaborators entered this information by hand ( mostly using pencil ) , in a total of 65 notebooks . The first 55 notebooks contain highly detailed family data , the remaining 10 notebooks contain less detailed street information . The family notebooks Early in the poverty survey , Booth began to collect information for every family in each street of London that had children . He and his collaborators entered this information into notebooks that Booth had specially printed for his inquiry . During the early part of the family survey , Booth actually had three different notebook layouts printed . As the example illustrated below reveals , the notebook entries include the street number , occupation of the head of household ( usually highly abbreviated ) , an indication of the wife's occupation ( especially if they were the household head ) , the number of childen in various age groups , the number of rooms occupied and rent paid ( often a single summary for an entire street ) , and notes on the social position of the household . Here is part of a page of the notebook recording informaiton for families in a street in Poplar : When the original information had been gathered from the attendance officers , Booth and his co-workers converted the head of household occupations into a ' section ' number , and gave each family that had children a letter ( A to H ) that indicated to which of seven social classes they belonged .

Haiti : Beyond the Capital Posted 17 January 2010 22 : 42 GMT Much of the coverage of the destruction in the earthquake's aftermath has been focused in and around Haiti's capital city , Port-au-Prince .

Back in 1992 the Boeing scientists Tom Caudell and David Mizell coined the phrase Augmented Reality to describe how aircraft assemblers in Seattle were given head-mounted displays that showed them photographic images of their work enriched with layers of technical information . Now Inge de Waard , e-learning coordinator and researcher at the Institute of Tropical Medicine in Antwerp , Belgium , reported to the ONLINE EDUCA BERLIN conference in December on how her team trialled Augmented Reality in tropical medicine . De Waard , a pioneer of e-learning projects in South Asia , Africa and Latin America , forecasts that "" AR will reach us , and change all of us , within five years "" . The Antwerp e-learning team started a pilot AR project early in 2010 , looking for a tool that would help learners to visualise complex information , often difficult to explain in words or simple pictures .

Climate tug of war disrupting Australian atmospheric circulation patterns June 26 , 2013 ? Further evidence of climate change shifting atmospheric circulation in the southern Australian-New Zealand region has been identified in a new study . The study , in the Nature journal Scientific Reports , demonstrates that mid-latitude high pressure zones ( 30 o S-45 o S ) are being pushed further into the Southern Ocean by rising global temperatures associated with greenhouse warming . This is despite more frequent occurrences of strong El Ni ? os in recent decades , which should have drawn the high pressure zones in the opposite direction toward the equator . "" What we are seeing , "" says study lead author , Mr Guojian Wang "" is a ' tug of war ' between stronger El Ni ? os driving the winds north and the greenhouse gas-warming effect driving the winds south . "" Mr Wang , said the result confirms the robustness of the Southern Hemisphere circulation changes over the past three to four decades as the global temperature rose , "" so much so that it overode the influence from strong El Ni ? os during this period . "" Study co-author , Dr Wenju Cai said the most conspicuous change is a rising sea level pressure in the mid-latitude bands and a decreasing sea level pressure over the Southern high latitudes ( 55 o -70 o S ) , a pattern referred to as the Southern Annular Mode . The changing pressures indicate a poleward or southward expansion of the tropical and subtropical atmospheric zones . In turn , this indicates that over the long-term , there is a relationship between a rising global mean temperature and an upward trend of the Southern Annular Mode . Dr Cai has",1.0

Project Frog's technology improves traditional building construction methods by combining semi-custom designs with a pre-engineered kit of energy-efficient building components . This enables higher quality , more environmentally sustainable , faster and cheaper construction . Through advanced performance modeling , Project Frog analyzes how its buildings will perform in each location , allowing owners to optimize a building kit to match their desired performance . The kits are delivered to project sites ready for assembly , and typically take one to six months to construct – less than half the time required for traditional construction . Project Frog's buildings use at least 25 percent less energy than the strictest building codes in the United States , and as much as 80 percent less energy in certain parts of the country . Project Frog manufactures its commercial building systems for educational and government organizations , healthcare offices and retail spaces . "" We make the complicated and lengthy process of new construction faster and easier for our customers by providing a kit of high precision , sustainable parts that are optimized based on the structure's size , use and location , "" said Ann Hand , CEO of Project Frog . Construction of the Project Frog building at GE's John F. Welch Leadership Development Center is expected to be completed by the end of this year . Established in 1956 , the Learning Center , also known as "" Crotonville , "" was the first of its kind and has been at the forefront of real-world application for the latest thinking in organizational development , leadership , innovation and change .

Such changes are especially likely because the court did not impose any restrictions on how retailers could use this newly permitted data , despite the ruling saying that data is solely to give online shops a better chance of fighting digital download fraud . With the explosion of mobile applications , digital content of this sort is available at a wide range of retailers . This goes beyond downloading songs , movies , television shows or ebooks to downloaded games , software applications and ringtones . How-to videos from Lowe's , jazz music sold by Starbucks and recipe collections and videos from Williams-Sonoma could all play into this digital decision . As a practical matter , this decision is likely to have little impact on traditional online versus online competition , as Amazon and other major pure-play E-tailers have already been gathering plenty of such information – despite what had been potential legal challenges . No , the change will likely happen in-store , because in-store will find new ways to leverage all of the new online data that the court has now sanctioned . Home Depot is one of many chains that has been using creative techniques – in Home Depot's case , it looks for shoppers using the same payment card online and in-store – to grab in-store activity and share it with the online operation . Now , that can be reversed , with online ( which the court said could take this data without restriction ) able to share it with in-store .

Epilogue I Siberia . On the banks of a broad solitary river stands a town , one of the administrative centres of Russia ; in the town there is a fortress , in the fortress there is a prison . In the prison the second-class convict Rodion Raskolnikov has been confined for nine months . Almost a year and a half has passed since his crime . There had been little difficulty about his trial . The criminal adhered exactly , firmly , and clearly to his statement . He did not confuse nor misrepresent the facts , nor soften them in his own interest , nor omit the smallest detail . He explained every incident of the murder , the secret of the pledge ( the piece of wood with a strip of metal ) which was found in the murdered woman's hand . He described minutely how he had taken her keys , what they were like , as well as the chest and its contents ; he explained the mystery of Lizaveta's murder ; described how Koch and , after him , the student knocked , and repeated all they had said to one another ; how he afterwards had run downstairs and heard Nikolay and Dmitri shouting ; how he had hidden in the empty flat and afterwards gone home . He ended by indicating the stone in the yard off the Voznesensky Prospect under which the purse and the trinkets were found . The whole thing , in fact , was perfectly clear . The lawyers and the judges were very much struck , among other things , by the fact that he had hidden the trinkets and the purse under a stone , without making use of them , and that , what was",1.0

Paper 26 : The application of Clifford algebra to calculations of multicomponent chemical composition . Dr John P. Fletcher , Chemical Engineering and Applied Chemistry , School of Engineering and Applied Science , Aston University , Aston Triangle , Birmingham B4 7 ET , U. K. Email : J. P. F letcher @ aston . a c . u k Abstract In a mixture of chemical compounds , the significant variable is often the proportion of molecules , normally expressed as a mole fraction in a particular sample . The fractions are constrained to add to one , so any change such as the addition of some more of any chemical component causes all of the mole fractions change in a nonlinear way . Lasenby et al [ 1 ] have applied Clifford Algebra to the problem of projection and shown that problems can be made linear and results obtained . In this paper a similar approach is used to show that some nonlinear problems , such as conversion between molar and mass basis , become linear when projected into a space of increased dimension . When this is done using the V product defined by Miralles et al this [ 2 ] can be done using a Clifford algebra with all positive signature . Examples are given of the results of the formulation . 1 Introduction Calculation of multicomponent chemical composition is necessary in many calculations in chemical engineering and chemistry . It is complicated by the fact the some of the calculations are on the basis of the mass of each component present , and others on the basis of the relative number of molecules . Different molecules differ in relative mass , expressed as the relative molecular mass , or molecular weight . The proportions of a",1.0

When it comes to choosing a solar panel , electricians may base their decision on nominal efficiency factors or the price per Watt peak . These are of course two important criteria – but , from a long-term perspective , simply not enough . After all , solar installations must last for 25 years . And they will , provided they are installed correctly and are of good quality . But how do you actually recognise good quality in a solar panel ? For Conergy Australia general manager David McCallum , such panels must fulfil three criteria : they must be high-yield , solid and safe . Efficiency delivers high-yield The solar cells themselves are responsible for the yield factor . Innovative cell designs can deliver efficiencies of 16 % to 23 % , depending on material and processing effort . The market is currently dominated by cells with two metallic collector contacts on the upper side – ' busbars ' . Some manufacturers print three busbars instead of two onto their solar panels to allow for more efficient dissipation of the generated power . David says there are definite benefits in improved power distribution . "" Three busbars help to reduce contact resistance between the cells . The result is increased and more consistent module efficiency . "" He also believes that combined with suitable cell connectors , the use of three busbars provides more reliability in terms of power generation . David and his colleagues also favour bypass diodes when it comes to module manufacturing . "" They function like a protection switch for the cells . If , for example , foliage should shade individual cells , the bypass diodes will channel away power , thus protecting the shaded cells , "" he explains . "" Once",1.0

American politics has always been defined by sex . This is not to say that the American system is inherently corrupt ; sex has played a role in the politics of all civilizations . From Caesar , who consented to an alliance with ancient Egypt out of lust for Queen Cleopatra , to Louis XIV , who allowed his personal prostitutes to determine which citizens could be present at court , sex has effectively shaped the political "" haves "" and "" have nots "" for centuries . Does the omnipresence of sex in politics mean that Americans should accept some amount of sexual deviancy in their political candidates ? The answer is far from simple . There is a tendency amongst Americans to ascribe unreasonable amounts of idolatry to politicians . Often times , we hold them to standards of perfectionism we ourselves do not adhere to . Although they are responsible for running the country , there is no inherent need for politicians to be moral dynamos , at least in terms of sex . Certainly no one would advocate electing amoral politicians , but there is a distinction between different moral ideals . For example , while being dishonest is both a moral hazard and a political hazard , overt sexuality is at best only a moral hazard . Dishonesty may cause politicians to do their jobs less effectively because they may launder money or fix elections . The same can not be said for politicians who engage in sexual acts ; unless they are engaging in sexual activities while at work , there is no reason their sexual conduct would interfere with their ability to make intelligent political decisions . I am neither arguing that politicians should engage in sexual acts unreservedly nor that there are",1.0

Mazda Deep Orange Concept : A Leap into the Future ? At first glance , the Mazda Deep Orange concept looks like it would be more at home in a space ship rather than a garage . The sleek , curved hood and slit-like headlights are reminiscent of a snake's head and causes the onlooker to wonder , "" What 's under the hood ? "" The trim hatchback juxtaposes these sporty features , combining sexy with practical and creating the perfect combination that 's unlike anything we have seen before . Engineering students at the Clemson University International Center for Automotive Research ( CU-ICAR ) first created the Mazda Deep Orange concept to represent what the Millennial generation wants in a car . This generation , which ranges from ages 18 to 33 , is a prime customer for automakers and has been the inspiration for many new vehicle remodels throughout the industry . The Deep Orange design is completely different from the usual compact cars marketed to young buyers . Not only is it larger , but the concept car also has the ability to fit 6 people comfortably with its 3 × 3 seating . "" They do n't want compact cars , they want something more mature , "" said Paul J. Venhovens , holder of the BMW-endowed chair in systems integration at CU-ICAR and head of the vehicle program there . "" Eighty percent of the vehicles purchased by this generation are used , but when they buy new they want a fairly traditional sedan with lots of space .

Almost every element is identical , but rather than use Amazon Payments as US users do , backers of UK projects will enter their details directly into the main Kickstarter website . Can members of the public based outside of the UK pledge to UK projects ? Yes . As with any other Kickstarter project , people from across the globe can pledge . Will there be a special UK Kickstarter website ? No. UK-based Kickstarter drives will be listed on the main website with all the other projects How do the fees charged by Kickstarter work for UK-based projects ? Pledges under £ 10 are subject to a 5 per cent fee , while pledges of £ 10 or over will be charged at 3 per cent . There will be no charge applied if the project is unsuccessful in reaching its funding goal . Will pledges be displayed in sterling or dollars ? UK campaign amounts will be listed in pounds , but international backers will see their donation approximated to U.S. dollars prior to completion . What else will be introduced with the launch of Kickstarter UK ? In the build up to Kickstarter UK , the platform's team also introduced a streamlined international shipping option for both US and UK projects . The update means it will be much clearer when a project creator has requested that international backers add an additional amount to their pledges to cover shipping of games and other items",1.0

The ugly duckling It was lovely summer weather in the country , and the golden corn , the green oats , and the haystacks piled up in the meadows looked beautiful . The stork walking about on his long red legs chattered in the Egyptian language which he had learnt from his mother . The corn-fields and meadows were surrounded by large forests , in the midst of which were deep pools . It was , indeed , delightful to walk about in the country . In a sunny spot stood a pleasant old farm-house close by a deep river , and from the house down to the water side grew great burdock leaves , so high , that under the tallest of them a little child could stand upright . The spot was as wild as the centre of a thick wood . In this snug retreat sat a duck on her nest , watching for her young brood to hatch ; she was beginning to get tired of her task , for the little ones were a long time coming out of their shells , and she seldom had any visitors . The other ducks liked much better to swim about in the river than to climb the slippery banks , and sit under a burdock leaf , to have a gossip with her . At length one shell cracked , and then another , and from each egg came a living creature that lifted its head and cried , "" Peep , peep .

Centennial : Eight reasons to vote no How can any Centennial elected official support the Home Rule Charter , up for a vote on June 10 ? The charter fails in several areas . Here are three ; the first should give all elected Centennial officials pause and the second should make you angry . 1 . Remove Each Other ? Section 2.13 of the Charter allows for the city council and mayor to remove , with "" good cause "" , any member of the council or the mayor . What is wrong with that ? Well , you voted them in , do n't you think you should reserve the power and right to vote them out ? Why should that right be taken away from you ? Imagine a scenario where your representative is tough , challenging the status quo and probing for answers and facts . You voted him into office with a strong majority and expect him to challenge when appropriate . Now imagine another who is a strong leader , someone who can pull or bully others to their point of view . This person needs only to gather five more votes ( total of six needed ) and your elected official could be removed from office and thereby trump the voice of the people – ignoring your vote that originally placed him or her in office . 2 . Eliminate Elected Positions ? Sections 8.5 & 8.7 of the charter remove the two elected positions that you , the citizens , voted to maintain just a few years ago . The majority of the charter commissioners voted that their logic to remove the elected City Clerk and City Treasurer is superior to your vote . They are sending the unintended message that you",1.0

Astounding Reports From Everywhere Posted on Nov 9th , 2012 . 2258 comments As a writer , I 've been fascinated by the fundraising emails and pitch letters I 've received during the presidential campaign . They 're especially interesting when you take the politics out and look at them purely from the point of view of craft . These pitches have changed a lot over time , but the essential requirements remain the same . They have to grab you immediately . They have to connect emotionally . And they must convince you to take action . Those first two imperatives also apply , in a different way , to writing fiction . In my files I have hard copies of fundraising letters from the 2000 presidential campaign – one from George W. Bush , which was actually addressed to my neighbors ( sorry guys – I did n't think you 'd mind if I kept it ) and one from Al Gore , which was addressed to me . I 've studied them from time to time , running them through Word Count , looking at words per sentence , sentences per paragraph , the Flesch Reading Ease score , and the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level score . Both letters seem nearly perfect to me , and I still use them as models when I need to write similar ( though non-political ) letters at what I call my day job . A couple things stand out as I look at those letters now . One , they 're long – several pages each . And two , they were delivered by snail mail . What the hell were we thinking back in 2000 ? We still read stuff on paper ?!? In contrast , this year's emails from",1.0

Budapest Open Access Initiative An old tradition and a new technology have converged to make possible an unprecedented public good . The old tradition is the willingness of scientists and scholars to publish the fruits of their research in scholarly journals without payment , for the sake of inquiry and knowledge . The new technology is the internet . The public good they make possible is the world-wide electronic distribution of the peer-reviewed journal literature and completely free and unrestricted access to it by all scientists , scholars , teachers , students , and other curious minds . Removing access barriers to this literature will accelerate research , enrich education , share the learning of the rich with the poor and the poor with the rich , make this literature as useful as it can be , and lay the foundation for uniting humanity in a common intellectual conversation and quest for knowledge . For various reasons , this kind of free and unrestricted online availability , which we will call open access , has so far been limited to small portions of the journal literature . But even in these limited collections , many different initiatives have shown that open access is economically feasible , that it gives readers extraordinary power to find and make use of relevant literature , and that it gives authors and their works vast and measurable new visibility , readership , and impact . To secure these benefits for all , we call on all interested institutions and individuals to help open up access to the rest of this literature and remove the barriers , especially the price barriers , that stand in the way . The more who join the effort to advance this cause , the sooner we will all enjoy the",1.0

Is Apathy Killing Your Department ? Apathy is a systemic disease for any organization ; from law enforcement to private enterprise . It starts small , making almost imperceptible in-roads that may go undetected for years . It quietly spreads throughout your building eating away at productivity , morale , ethics , effectiveness and every other aspect of your agency's existence . Predictably , the end result is the death of your department . Not in the traditional sense of an end to your existence , but in the sense that your people are no longer able or willing to uphold the duties entrusted to them when they took the oath . Just like diseases of the body , apathy is not always an unexpected or uninvited killer . We bring it upon ourselves . Like a three pack-a-day smoker , your agency could be gleefully barreling toward its own demise , aware of the consequences and simply unwilling to change current practices to save its own skin . It might not even be the result of something you are doing , but the result of many things you are failing to do . A person who fails to exercise and who fails to feed the machine a balanced diet suffers the consequences of obesity , heart disease , etc. An agency that fails to take steps to quell or prevent apathy suffers the lingering illnesses associated with a general feeling of , "" I do n't care . "" Apathy does not always target an entire department . It can be as specific as a single squad or a particular shift within your department . It can plant its roots in patrol at the lowest level of your agency or infect the desk of your highest command staff member",1.0

Question What is ' drilled ' oil valued at ? The first time a single barrel of oil is sold , after it is drilled from the ground , what does it sell for ? How many times does it change hands ( The thing that changes hand - contract that is ' the future ' ' option - WTH IS IT ? ) before final destination ? Then when it reaches what the end what is it 's cost ? If the number is never static can I get a historical ' list ' If that is too much to answer .... With no one in "" the middle "" how much does a freshly filled barrel of oil cost today ? Is there an average "" X "" less than the ' delivered ' ? Answer There is some variability in the price of oil depending on where it is drilled , what the quality of the oil is , and other factors . Here 's a great place to find info on oil prices : http://phx.corporate-ir.net/External.Fil... This is from Valero's investor relations webpage . Valero is the largest US refinery company . The spread between gas prices and oil prices is very important to Valero because Valero buys raw oil , refines it , and then sells it as gas . The difference in these two prices is Valero's profit . The chart shows several different grades of crude oil and how much they cost by location . It also shows different refined products and their prices ( including gasoline , diesel , residential fuel oil , etc. ) . http://www.valero.com/InvestorRelations/... -------------------------------------- ... Oil futures generally track the average price of oil across the globe pretty well . The futures contracts will specify what grade of oil",1.0

ALEX BRUMMER , DAILY MAIL CITY EDITOR Ratcatcher poisons pensions Alex Brummer , Daily Mail 21 December 2005 THE attempt by Rentokil to abrogate its contract with employees inside its defined salary pension scheme should be fiercely opposed . If the workers concerned are well enough organised then they could almost certainly mount a legal challenge . They could also follow the example of workers in the public sector and at Centrica , and threaten to bring the company to a halt by withdrawing their labour . The attempt to end accruals to defined benefit pension plans could ride roughshod over contract law and the rights of trustees . Senior business figures also believe that the employees concerned may well have a challenge to make under employment law , arguing that the change in pension arrangements is such an important part of their compensation package that it amounts to constructive dismissal . Efforts by second-line firms like Iceland to abolish defined benefit pensions for the existing workforce met with stiff resistance . When chairman Brian McGowan of Rentokil was seeking to fend off the unwanted attentions of Sir Gerry Robinson neither he nor his executives mentioned plans to poison the future retirement of its workforce . Paradoxically , employees might have been better protected had Robinson succeeded , since a change of control would have required approval by the Pensions Regulator . Each successive move by Labour to reform pensions has served to undermine private schemes . In addition to the 1997 tax raid , the government has added to the cost of pensions by imposing new reporting requirements and most recently through the Pensions Protection Fund . Moreover , the Turner report , by floating the idea of automatic enrolment for workers and lower compulsory contributions for employers ,",1.0

Letter dated 21 August 2000 from the Permanent Representative of the Democratic Republic of the Congo to the United Nations addressed to the President of the Security Council On instructions from my Government , I have the honour to inform you that troops from the regular Ugandan army are preparing a large-scale offensive in Equateur province . Those troops are being reinforced by Ugandan units formerly based in Kisangani , which were obliged to withdraw in order to permit administrative control of that city by the United Nations Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo . Ugandan arms and munitions from Kisangani are being transferred to Buta , from where they are being sent through a number of aerial rotations on to the Gbadolite , Gemena and Libenge fronts . Accordingly , munitions for heavy artillery were recently disembarked in Gemena . Likewise , Ugandan tanks have been positioned on the front line in the Mawiya region , 500 kilometres south of Gbadolite , and Ugandan troops are again being deployed to support Libenge . It is feared that all of this activity in Equateur province foreshadows a non-stop Ugandan military offensive against positions of the Congolese armed forces . My Government regrets this fresh violation of resolution 1304 ( 2000 ) , adopted by the Security Council on 16 June 2000 . My Government requests the Council to implement fully the aforementioned resolution , which under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations , inter alia : Demanded that Ugandan and Rwandan forces as well as forces of the Congolese armed opposition and other armed groups immediately and completely withdraw from Kisangani ; Also demanded that Uganda and Rwanda , which have violated the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Democratic Republic of the Congo ,",1.0

OMEGA's LE902 series linear encoders work on the principle of counting pulses as a series of graduations move past a detector . These graduations are deposited on a low-temperature - coefficient glass ( quartz glass ) and counted using photodetectors . Because the glass is exceptionally stable , the pitch of the graduations does not change , resulting in inherently good long term stability . Signal conditioning is performed in an in-line electronics assembly which converts signals from the probe head to a digital format which can be plugged directly into a digital readout , computer or PLC via an RS-232 adaptor or the LDN101 network card .

Schneider Electric , a global specialist in energy management , has launched its new Spacial CRS range of enclosure heaters adapted for outdoor installations , following the latest research into enclosure innovations . Offering maximum effectiveness against high humidity and condensation , the ultra thin design and very low power density per cm , allows constant heat diffusion within all enclosure surfaces . With an operational limit of -60 C , Spacial CRS heaters are also ideal for use in environments which experience extremely low temperatures . What 's more , the combination of a Schneider Electric control device such as a hygrostat , hygrometer or thermostat along with a Spacial CRS heater , allows energy consumption savings of up to 50 % compared with a heater installed without any control devices . The Spacial CRS heaters are designed to be placed closely to equipment that is highly humidity and temperature-sensitive , but with the least possible footprint . The ultra-thin design has a depth of 1 . 6mm , making them the narrowest heaters available on the market and enabling them to be installed in areas which were not previously accessible to the installer for example , the side panels , the rear part of door or the rear part of mounting plate . Five installation modes in total are now possible . The Spacial CRS heaters have a very low and steady set-off power compared with common PTC heaters , which prevents the occurrence of disturbances and preserves the electrical protection of the heaters . Furthermore , Spacial CRS heaters are UL , CUL , and VDE approved and are suitable for use in infrastructure segments for example in motorway , water , railway and public lighting applications as well as for the OEM's market . </doc>",1.0

"" Adolf Eichmann , the Nazi official who had inspired that turn of phrase , was the main organizer of the Wannsee Conference , a meeting of 15 senior Nazi leaders in suburban Berlin on January 20 , 1942 . There is perhaps no better window into the banality of evil than a collection of bureaucrats gathering at a working lunch to discuss the most-efficient means of murdering millions of European Jews . Eichmann had joined the SS in November 1932 . Just over a year later , he was assigned to Dachau , the first Nazi concentration camp in Germany . Dachau had been constructed within weeks of Adolf Hitler ' s rise to power , and it initially housed political prisoners of the Reich . In 1938 , after the Anschluss , Eichmann was tasked by SS chief Heinrich Himmler with purging Vienna's Jews , and he led a similar mission to Prague a year later . When all of Germany's security and secret police forces were consolidated into the Reich Security Central Office under Reinhard Heydrich , Eichmann was assigned to its section on Jewish affairs . It was in this role that Eichmann would convene the Wannsee Conference . Prior to 1942 , the Holocaust was carried out on a largely ad hoc basis . Jews were forced into ghettos in occupied territories , where conditions were harsh and disease was rampant , and it was assumed by Nazi officials that many would perish in forced labor camps . Germany invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941 , and the following month Hermann Göring ordered Heydrich to craft",1.0

Potential of wind power projects under the Clean Development Mechanism in India Results : CDM Potential of Wind Power Projects in India Considerable variation has been observed in the reported values of the PLF of the wind power plants in the CDM Project Design Documents ( Table 5 ) . Therefore , in this study to estimate the CDM potential of wind power projects in India the PLF of the wind power plants have been taken as 25 % . There are five regional grids within the country – the Northern , Western , Southern , Eastern and North-Eastern . Therefore , the CO2 emissions mitigation potential through wind power projects in India is estimated on the basis of the regional grids , whose emission factors have been calculated by the Central Electricity Authority ( CEA ) of the Government of India in 2006 . Table 6 presents the estimated values of CDM potential through wind power projects in India on the basis of the regional baselines . We now do a sensitivity analysis with regards to additionality determination . The case of lax additionality assumes that all wind power projects submitted are registered . The median case assumes that the rejection rate remains at the current level ( 2 out of 18 projects , i . e . 11 % ) . The case of stringent additionality assumes that 50 % of the projects are registered . In the lax additionality case , gross annual CER potential of wind power in India reaches 86 million . Similarly , based on the technical potential of wind power projects in India the CDM potential has been estimated as 25 million tonne . Among all the states in India , Gujarat has the largest CO2 emissions mitigation potential through wind power (",1.0

Cancer lie military clerk Simon Buckden jailed A former military clerk who lied about having cancer to swindle victims out of money and services worth more than £ 7 , 500 has been jailed for 16 months . Simon Buckden , 44 , from Leeds , received donations including a £ 2 , 000 holiday after lying about his condition . He also falsely claimed to have served in the SAS and seen active duty in Bosnia and Northern Ireland . He was sentenced at Leeds Crown Court having pleaded guilty to six counts of fraud midway through his trial . For live updates and more from across West Yorkshire Buckden described traumatic experiences from his fabricated career , including holding a dying child in his arms , and claimed he suffered with post-traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) as a result . But jurors heard Buckden was a military clerk who had carried out one overseas deployment to Bosnia but had never experienced front line active service . He claimed he had been diagnosed with rectal cancer midway through a challenge to run 100 marathons in 100 weeks to raise awareness of PTSD . Judge Christopher Batty told Buckden : "" You are a dishonest and manipulative man . "" Over a period from at least 2009 , you developed a fictitious persona , a dishonest life history in order to advance your own prospects in life . "" The disrespect you have shown to those who have suffered cancer and to those who have lost their battle with it is quite breathtaking . "" At one stage during the challenge he ran from Leeds to Westminster , receiving the praise of former Prime Minister David Cameron . Mr Cameron said : "" I 'm happy to pay tribute",1.0

Aereo catches over-the-air TV material that 's show completely free and flows it to users' pcs and devices for a regular monthly subscription fee . TV and show companies have actually been combating Aereo tooth and nail , and recently they petitioned the Supreme Court to quit Aereo in its tracks . Last night , it was revealed that the NFL and MLB submitted an amicus short last week urging the High court to agree journalists against Aereo . ' Technical chicanery ' The disagreement versus Aereo is in part that content copyright owners must license networks and journalists to re-transmit their programming , however Aereo asserts its streaming material is not technically a re-broadcast . The business contends it 's actually an exclusive program since each client's content is transmitted independently . Journalists do n't see it in this way , and the NFL and MLB see Aereo as a threat to their business design . "" If copyright holders shed their unique retransmission licensing rights and the substantial benefits derived from those rights when they put programming on broadcast terminals , those terminals will certainly come to be less eye-catching mediums for dispersing copyrighted content , "" the organizations' attorneys filled in the amicus short . And here 's the not-so-thinly-veiled threat : "" The alternative for copyright holders will be to relocate that content to paid cable networks ( such as ESPN and TNT ) where Aereo-like firms could not hijack and exploit their programs without permission , "" the brief continued . The MLB and NFL focused on the federal implications of this instance , and clarified that together they account for about $ ONE HUNDRED thousand of the $ 300 thousand that broadcasters gather in licensing fees general .

Bifurcation Theory In a dynamical system , a bifurcation is a qualitative change in the behaviour of the system caused by a small smooth change in the value of a system parameter . Bifurcations are responsible for the creation and annihilation of equilibria and periodic solutions in a given system and their occurrence is accompanied by a change of solution stability . The knowledge of such qualitative changes is paramount to understanding the long-run behaviour of any dynamical system . The occurrence of bifurcations can be investigated geometrically by analysing the phase space for different parameter values of a given system . Geometric representations of bifurcation structures have the advantage of allowing a visual interpretation of how the parameters of a system affect its behaviour . A bifurcation diagram is a plot of the solutions ( or some feature of the solutions such as the maximum or L2 norm ) of a given system against a single system parameter . These plots are commonly used to display how the stability of solutions changes as the given parameter is varied . In the analysis of dynamical systems with more than one parameter , it is important to determine not only which parameters will cause bifurcations when their values are changed , but also how the bifurcation structure for a particular parameter is affected when changing the value of another . This is known as two-parameter bifurcation analysis . Generally , two-parameter bifurcation diagrams include curves of codimension-1 bifurcations , as well as specific points on these curves defining codimension-2 bifurcations . In order to characterise a particular bifurcation , the behaviour of the system within the region of a local bifurcation point can often be reduced to a simplified normal form . The normal form is the system with a minimum",1.0

David Crawshaw A blazing inferno is moving quickly in your direction . You feel the intense heat and the air is clogged with smoke . Deer , snakes , and birds flee past you , even the insects attempt to escape . You would run too if you could , but unfortunately , you are a plant . The fire begins to lick at your leaves and you wait ... While no one likes the sight of a burned forest , fire is important for the functioning of a number of ecosystems and many plants are specially adapted to these fire-prone habitats . Read on to discover some of the amazing ways plants survive – and even thrive – in the face of wildfire . Eric Draper / AP Perhaps the most amazing fire adaptation is that some species actually require fire for their seeds to sprout . Some plants , such as the lodgepole pine , Eucalyptus , and Banksia , have serotinous cones or fruits that are completely sealed with resin . These cones / fruits can only open to release their seeds after the heat of a fire has physically melted the resin . Other species , including a number of shrubs and annual plants , require the chemical signals from smoke and charred plant matter to break seed dormancy . Some of these plants will only sprout in the presence of such chemicals and can remain buried in the soil seed bank for decades until a wildfire awakens them . The image shows lodgepole pine seedlings growing next to the charred remains of their parent plants following the 1988 Yellowstone National Park fires . Graphic House / EB Inc.

Latest salvos in public service delivery debate - 28 / 06 / 05 A new book by Association of Chief Executives of Voluntary Organisations ( acevo ) and the Social Market Foundation ( SMF ) calls for substantial increase in vol sector delivery of public services . But their views have not been universally welcomed . The publication ' Communities in Control : the new third-sector agenda for public service reform ' says that the government will fail to meet its manifesto commitments on public service reform unless it makes better use of the third sector . It says in terms of delivery of public services Children's services , health services , services to prisoners , even running a prison should n ' t be ruled out . Acevo head of strategy Nick Aldridge ( pictured ) said : "" We want to see the state transferring substantial sums of money to third sector organisations to enable them to take over the delivery of public services as happened with housing associations in the 1980s . ' The advantages of using the voluntary sector are that they ' personalise their services in a way that government finds very difficult through monolithic , unresponsive , one-size-fits-all public services . ' SMF acting director Ann Rossiter said : "" It will have the benefit of building social capital and building a robust civil society "" . Acevo are clear that the voluntary sector should n ' t just turn into a mirror image of the public sector and there would be no point transfering services if services do n't improve . NCVO however are wary . While they believe the sector can and does play a significant role in shaping and delivering public services , they say charities must engage in public service",1.0

The Transatlantic Index How should we assess the state of transatlantic relations nowadays ? With a nod to Wall Street , we can say that the Alliance is up , Europe is flat , and the United States is clearly down . The Alliance is "" up "" for one key reason : the warming of France's relations with the US following Nicolas Sarkozy's election as French president . For the first time since Charles de Gaulle established the Fifth Republic , France's priority is no longer to live in opposition to the US . The signs of this shift are profound , even spectacular . From a toughening of France's position on Iran to a real warming of relations with Israel , not to mention symbolic gestures like Sarkozy's summer vacation in America , or Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner's arrival in Baghdad , this is a New France , one seriously considering a return to NATO's integrated military structure . France's shift is the result of both political calculus and deeply felt emotion . For Sarkozy , the French are not anti-Americans , but simply anti-Bush . In his willingness to break with the past – in particular with Jacques Chirac's legacy – and in adding a global spin to his "" mandate for change , "" Sarkozy is paving the way for the post-Bush America that will soon be here . He knows that the "" return of France "" as an influential actor in Europe presupposes a France that is closer to America , which will automatically bring France closer to Germany and Great-Britain , not to mention Poland and Italy .

BACKGROUND Class certification allows plaintiffs' lawyers to aggregate the claims of many individuals or entities to be tried in a single proceeding , giving them enormous leverage that often overshadows the actual legal or factual merit of the claims . The certification decision is often the pivotal moment in such litigations , because if a class is certified , the company faces enormous pressure to settle to avoid even a small risk of a colossal verdict . In theory , the federal courts are supposed to certify classes only after a rigorous analysis shows that they meet certain standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23 . In antitrust cases , the most important requirement is usually "" predominance , "" which means that "" questions of law or fact common to class members predominate over any questions affecting only individual members . "" Under the federal antitrust laws , the plaintiff has to show , among other things , that it was impacted by the alleged violation ( e.g. , paid higher prices ) , and certification typically hinges on whether injury and damages to each class member can be shown with evidence common to all of them . For much of the five-decade history of the modern Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23 , the scales were tilted in favor of finding antitrust cases susceptible to class certification . That began to change in the last decade with several circuit decisions heralding a more analytically rigorous , evenhanded approach . Then the Supreme Court issued its landmark 2011 decision reversing certification of a class in Wal-Mart Stores , Inc. v. Dukes . Although Wal-Mart was an employment discrimination , not antitrust , case , and did not turn on the predominance requirement of Rule 23 (",1.0

The FTU was formed as a multi-racial organization . However , in 1960 the Fijian Teachers Union ( FTA ) was founded . The FTA limited its membership to indigenous Fijians . Most indigenous Fijian educators left the FTU , so that the FTU's membership is now overwhelmingly Indian . [ 3 ] In 2004 , the Fiji Teachers Union counted about 4,200 members ( including over 700 indigenous Fijians ) . The Fiji Teachers' Association had about 3,500 members . [ 4 ] By 1924 there were a significant number of local and overseas trained in Fiji , who saw the need for an organised group of teachers to discuss their professional and administrative matters . Under the leadership of Sewak Masih ( of Toorak Boys' School ) , the Methodist Teachers' Association was formed and had members from Suva and Rewa . It adopted a motto : "" To serve the Community is to serve God "" . This association of teachers kept meeting in Suva until 1927 when Sewak Masih was transferred to Levuka and this gave him an opportunity to invite all the teachers from Suva , Ba , Lautoka and Nadi to attend a conference in Levuka . A teacher by the name of Dukhharan travelled with his group from the Western Districts to attend this meeting . Among other matters a plan for a united organization of teachers was kumar Another conference of the Methodist Teachers' Association was held at Methodist Boys' School in Toorak in 1928 where the following office bearers were elected : President : Sewak Masih , Vice President : P M Stephen , Secretary : G P Andrew and Assistant Secretary : HR Narayan .

In certain sports , such as football , field hockey , ice hockey , handball , rugby union , lacrosse and rugby league , winger is a position . It refers to positions on the extreme left and right sides of the pitch ( the "" wings "" ) . In American football and Canadian football , the analogous position is the wide receiver . Wingers often try to use pace to exploit extra space available on the flanks that can be made available by their team-mates dominating the centre ground . They must be wary however of not crossing the touchline and going out of play . In sports where the main method of scoring involves attacking a small goal ( by whatever name ) in the centre of the field , a common tactic is to cross the ball to a central team-mate . Contents In football , a winger is an attacking midfielder in a wide position . Wingers are usually players of great pace or dribbling ability so as to provide cut-backs or crosses from which strikers can score . Their main function is to support attack from the wings . Wingers do lots of high-speed running from defence to attack . In Australian rules football , the wingers or wingmen require considerable pace and stamina , as they run up and down the ground linking play between defence and attack and are normally highly skilled in kicking . "" Winger "" , in ice hockey , is a forward position of a player whose primary zone of play on the ice is along the outer playing area . They typically work by flanking the centre forward .

CHAPTER XI IN THE TENT The man who guided Salammbo made her ascend again beyond the pharos in the direction of the Catacombs , and then go down the long suburb of Molouya , which was full of steep lanes . The sky was beginning to grow grey . Sometimes palm-wood beams jutting out from the walls obliged them to bend their heads . The two horses which were at the walk would often slip ; and thus they reached the Teveste gate . Its heavy leaves were half open ; they passed through , and it closed behind them . At first they followed the foot of the ramparts for a time , and at the height of the cisterns they took their way along the Taenia , a narrow strip of yellow earth separating the gulf from the lake and extending as far as Rhades . No one was to be seen around Carthage , whether on the sea or in the country . The slate-coloured waves chopped softly , and the light wind blowing their foam hither and thither spotted them with white rents . In spite of all her veils , Salammbo shivered in the freshness of the morning ; the motion and the open air dazed her . Then the sun rose ; it preyed on the back of her head , and she involuntarily dozed a little . The two animals rambled along side by side , their feet sinking into the silent sand . When they had passed the mountain of the Hot Springs , they went on at a more rapid rate , the ground being firmer . But although it was the season for sowing and ploughing , the fields were as empty as the desert as far as the eye",1.0

You are here : Home "" News "" Archive "" 2006 "" April "" Charity demands action on child ASBOs ( 12 April ) Charity demands action on child ASBOs ( 12 April ) Anti-social behaviour orders ' becoming entirely routine ' Anti-social behaviour orders -- ASBOs -- are ' catapulting children into custody ' , the charity Barnardo's has warned . When ASBOs were first introduced in 1998 they were intended for use with children only in ' exceptional circumstances ' , said Barnardo's chief executive Martin Narey . In the two years to the end of 2000 , there were only 61 child ASBOs . By contrast , in 2003 there were more than 500 in 2003 and more than 1,000 in 2004 . ' This is not exceptional use , ' Mr Narey said . ' In some areas the use of ASBOs on children is becoming entirely routine . ASBOs have their place but their overuse is unnecessarily catapulting children into a custodial system which has so many children in it that the chances of rehabilitation are extremely slim and the chances of deeper criminalisation very likely . ' Barnardo's is calling for changes to the law so that an assessment of needs and circumstances must be carried out before any child is given an ASBO . It is also demanding that ASBOs for children run for shorter periods . Currently , ASBOs have to run for a minimum of two years , which the charity says to a child will ' seem like infinity ' . </doc>",1.0

The squeal of tires . The sickening sound of metal grinding against metal as you lurch forward in the driver's seat . As you climb out of the auto , you 're shaken – but fortunately you and the driver who hit you are not injured . Regrettably , the identical is not accurate for your car . Even soon after you endure the hassle of dealing with insurance organizations and the inconvenience of taking your car in for repair , the bottom line is that your car just is n't worth as considerably . "" The resale worth of a automobile with an accident history is considerably significantly less than a comparable car that 's never ever been in an accident , "" says Omar Quddus , President and Co-Founder of Advocate Auto Claims LLC ( www.advocateautoclaims.com ) . This phenomenon is named "" diminished value , "" and the at-fault or third party's insurance coverage firm has an obligation to compensate the driver who was not at fault for this distinction in industry value . "" Insurance coverage firms are necessary to restore a automobile to its pre-loss situation and value , "" says Quddus . "" Regrettably , most buyers are not conscious that they are entitled to diminished value compensation – and insurance companies do not volunteer that data . "" That 's the reason Quddus is on a mission to educate consumers about their rights , and why Advocate Auto Claims pursues diminished worth claims on behalf of drivers who were n't at fault in accidents . "" Even when buyers are conscious of the diminished worth issue , they are typically ill-equipped to handle the roadblocks that an insurance coverage organization will throw at them , "" he says .

The Minister calls attention to the large-scale military action launched by the Turkish armed forces against northern Iraq on 8 May 2000 , and he urges the United Nations to meet its responsibility , as stipulated in the Charter , to prevent aggression and intimidation of the kind to which Iraq is being subjected . I should be grateful if you would have the present letter and its annex circulated as a document of the Security Council . ( Signed ) Saeed H.

This session is all about the HOW of telling a great story to engage your audience whoever they may be ... Some of the great presenters / storytellers that we see in the media appear to be effortless - spontaneous in their delivery , endlessly witty , great at timing , creating mood , leaving an unforgettable message etc. But of course , these people are professional communicators and what we do n't see is the intense preparation that goes into their message and its delivery . For example , the journalist on location researching and choosing the right examples to tug at our heart strings ; the politician telling us his values , his strategy , his motivation in the hope that it will win our votes . And the same should be true of the leader motivating others ... This high energy , fun , practical and interactive session will help leaders to start thinking about their stories , and critically , understand how to present them in a way that engages their audiences . At the end of the session , leaders should feel equipped - know their next steps ; their strengths and where they might need to focus to become a storytelling leader that creates a great personal impact and connects with their followers . The sessions will include : Constructing a great story : Understanding the essentials of great presenting Building character : Exercises and practice in creating the narrative that sticks in the mind of the listener Creating drama : How to achieve momentum in a story , without overuse of sentiment It 's not what you say ...

Dear Mrs. Caroline Orange , Do you ever wonder where the money comes from to clean up the Chesapeake Bay ? It does n't come from the government or from city funds .

Every day we use that money to pay for crews to travel to polluted regions of the waterway to remove litter , saw apart large debris and work to prevent soil runoff and erosion . Our organization has successfully removed 200 tons of waste in the past two months alone . So how do we get the funds we use ? That 's easy - through the financial support of people like you . As a nature lover , we know you support keeping our waterways clean . Would you help us further our efforts with a tax deductible donation of $ 50 or more ? With this donation , you will finance an entire day of cleanup and help us buy desperately needed supplies , such as gloves and water test kits . You can either donate online or by returning the attached reply envelope with a check made out to "" Clean the Bay .

Brexit must happen on time , Theresa May insists Theresa May has said she is "" clear "" she expects to start talks on leaving the EU as planned by the end of March . The prime minister also played down the chances of an early general election , saying the next one "" should "" take place as scheduled in 2020 . The government is appealing against the High Court's decision that MPs and peers should vote on triggering Brexit . Mrs May said judges should "" specify how "" the vote might happen , if ministers are defeated again . The High Court ruled last Thursday that Parliament should have a say before the UK invokes Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty - which triggers up to two years of formal EU withdrawal talks . Labour has said it will not attempt to delay or scupper this process .

My own go-to resource , when faced with a matter that requires a political frame in which to examine how best to synthesize a way forward where paths appear to divide , is Socrates . ( If you know all matters of library management are political , then you can probably manage – not knowing this already , however , is no preclusion to your blossoming as a leader – albeit , a leader who best learn that all library management matters do , indeed , have a vein of politics threaded through . Thus the big [ ger ] bucks ) . Socrates , unlike a manager , did not direct , supervise or set performance standards . Socrates asked questions , and not just random questions but questions that demand reflection , imagination and a willingness to experience some level of personal ambiguity or discomfort on the part of the person who works to find the best response to each such question . The nonmanager leader in the library needs to learn how to frame such questions . The best questions a leader poses bring the management forward ; they do n't push a personal agenda , coerce , or belittle management as it is . The best questions focus management attention on how to synthesize the leader's new , perhaps strange ( to the nonleader ) vision with political reality . And what do managers who are fairly certain that their forte is administrative rather than visionary have to offer such leaders to forestall their disaffection with outgrowing the library that needs their guiding light ? Cetainly the top of the possible heap of responses to that one is a willingness for ambiguity and mild intellectual discomfort ( conditions from which no one dies and unfortunately too",1.0

The best way to keep yourself safe when you 're out is to take sensible precautions . For instance , it 's a good idea to have a personal attack alarm ( you can buy them in DIY stores ) for when you 're walking by yourself especially in the dark . Hold it in your hand so you can set it off easily if anyone tries to attack you , or take your bag or mobile . Stay in well-lit streets , and cross the road if you think anyone is following you . If they are , get to somewhere where there are other people as fast as you can . You 're always safer walking with friends than on your own - if it 's late , take a licensed taxi . Try and avoid isolated bus stops after dark , and never take short cuts through dark alleys , parks , woods or across waste ground . Do n't accept lifts from anyone you do n't know if a car stops and you feel threatened , get away as fast as you can , or set off your personal alarm if you have one . Keep your mobile hidden in your pocket , and cover jewellery as much as possible . You 're better off not wearing your personal stereo when you 're out either , because you wo n't be able to hear traffic or people coming up behind you . If anyone tries to steal your bag or phone , the safest thing to do is just let it go . If you get mugged , attacked or threatened in any way , tell the police about it as soon as you can . </doc>",1.0

Warm Air Heaters The majority of modern air conditioners are equipped with heating pumps which allows them to be turned into heating units . This is particularly important in winter months , when traditional heating methods , including radiators , tend to create stuffy and dust-ridden atmospheres . AC units , by creating hot air which is circulated around the room , allows users to get the benefits of warmth , while still moving the air in order to prevent dust and allergies . These air conditioning units , which are often called HVAC ( Heating and Ventilation Air Conditioning ) units , can be much more efficient than traditional radiators in creating a warm environment for offices and shops . In winter , AC units can be turned into heaters by reversing the processes usually used to cool air . The conditioner , which usually takes heat from the atmosphere , now evaporates this heat into the room , while the evaporator , usually expelling cold air into the room , now condenses the heat from indoors , warming it up before it is released . Therefore , this process actually helps in removing cool air as well as heating up the room using traditional methods . By combining the two elements of an air conditioning unit to create heat in a room , the office will become warmer more quickly , and will also cost less to heat . This is because the HVAC is not expending energy in heating up air in a cool environment . Instead , it is removing that air and replacing it with heat . This should also mean that office workers feel comfortable at a lower temperature , as there is less contrast between cool airs and warmth next to the radiator",1.0

Comcast initially declined they were doing anything to web traffic , than changed course and acknowledged they were slowing ( or "" throttling "" ) the traffic speeds but only as a "" reasonable "" measure to manage the traffic loads on their network . Peer to peer software , like Bit Torrent , often involves substantially more uploading of data than is typical for regular Internet browsing and email behavior . The throttling was claimed to be justified as a necessary step to balance the load this puts on servers and insure Comcast can provide and equally high quality of service for all customers . In November several consumer groups and a few companies asked the FCC to look into the allegations . Two of the groups even suggested an outrageous fine of $ 195k per subscriber . ( Comcast has about 12m subscribers ) . The FCC will now officially investigate whether Comcast ' s load balancing behavior was reasonable . They 'll also look into what obligation Comcast had to disclose these practices to their subscribers . Comcast stands by their statement that their actions are reasonable and "" in accordance with the FCC's policy statement . "" The investigation will hopefully determine that .

Great Goddess hypothesis The Great Goddess Hypothesis is that in Palaeolithic , Mesolithic and / or Neolithic Europe and Western Asia and North Africa , a singular , monotheistic female deity was worshipped prior to the development of the polytheistic pagan religions of the Bronze Age and Iron Age . Having first been proposed as an idea relating to ancient Greek religion in 1849 , it subsequently achieved some support amongst classicists . In the early 20th century , various historians began to postulate about the theory applying across Europe , and it was widely propagated by the archaeologist Marija Gimbutas in the 1980s . It has since been adopted by various feminist religious groups such as Dianic Wicca as a part of the mythology of their faith . The theory had been first proposed by the German Classicist Eduard Gerhard in 1849 , when he speculated that the various goddesses found in ancient Greek paganism had been representations of a singular goddess who had been worshipped far further back into prehistory . He associated this deity with the concept of Mother Earth , [ 1 ] which itself had only been developed in the 18th century by members of the Romanticist Movement . [ 2 ] Soon after , this theory began to be adopted by other classicists in France and Germany , such as Ernst Kroker , Fr . Lenormant and M.J. Menant , who further brought in the idea that the ancient peoples of Anatolia and Mesopotamia had influenced the Greek religion , and that therefore they also had once venerated a great goddess . [ 3 ] These ideas amongst various classicists echoed those of the Swiss judge J.J. Bachofen , who put forward the idea that the earliest human societies were matriarchal , but had",1.0

Acts 27 Paul Sails for Rome 1 When it was decided that we would sail for Italy , Paul and some other prisoners were handed over to a centurion named Julius , who belonged to the Imperial Regiment . 2 We boarded a ship from Adramyttium about to sail for ports along the coast of the province of Asia , and we put out to sea . Aristarchus , a Macedonian from Thessalonica , was with us . 3 The next day we landed at Sidon ; and Julius , in kindness to Paul , allowed him to go to his friends so they might provide for his needs . 4 From there we put out to sea again and passed to the lee of Cyprus because the winds were against us . 5 When we had sailed across the open sea off the coast of Cilicia and Pamphylia , we landed at Myra in Lycia . 6 There the centurion found an Alexandrian ship sailing for Italy and put us on board . 7 We made slow headway for many days and had difficulty arriving off Cnidus . When the wind did not allow us to hold our course , we sailed to the lee of Crete , opposite Salmone . 8 We moved along the coast with difficulty and came to a place called Fair Havens , near the town of Lasea . 9 Much time had been lost , and sailing had already become dangerous because by now it was after the Fast .

Reduce Cancer Reoccurrence , Wheatgerm Extract , Cancer : The Wheatgerm Extract That May Help Reduce Cancer Reoccurrence Cancer treatment has come a long way since the use of mustard gas derivatives in the early 1900s - or has it ? When doctors discovered during World War I that mustard gas destroyed bone marrow , they began to experiment with it as a way to kill cancer cells . Although they had little success with the mustard gas , it did pave the way for modern chemotherapy - which involves the most toxic and poisonous substances anyone deliberately puts in his body . These treatments kill much more than cancer cells - they have a devastating effect even on healthy ones . Sometimes it seems as if only a miracle could provide a cure that 's both safe and effective . And a miracle is just what Dr. Mate Hidvegi believed he found when he patented Avemar . Studies have shown that Avemar , a fermented wheatgerm extract , helps reduce cancer reoccurrence , possibly speed up cancer cell death and helps the immune system identify cancer cells for attack . A miracle in the making Back in World War I , Dr. Albert Szent-Györgyi ( a Nobel Prize recipient in 1937 for his discovery of vitamin C ) had seen the effects of mustard gas personally and was determined to find a safer alternative for cancer treatment . His goal was to prevent the rapid reproduction that is characteristic of cancer cells . He theorised that supplemental quantities of naturally occurring compounds in wheatgerm called DMBQ would help to chaperone cellular metabolism , allowing healthy cells to follow a normal course but prohibiting potentially cancerous ones from growing and spreading . His early experiments , published in the 1960s",1.0

I 'm Jessi , and this is my suitcase . But before I show you what I 've got inside , I 'm going to make a very public confession , and that is , I 'm outfit obsessed . I love finding , wearing , and more recently , photographing and blogging a different colorful , crazy outfit for every single occasion . But I do n't buy anything new . I get all my clothes secondhand from flee markets and thrift stores . Aww , thank you . Secondhand shopping allows me to reduce the impact my wardrobe has on the environment and on my wallet . I get to meet all kinds of great people ; my dollars usually go to a good cause ; I look pretty unique ; and it makes shopping like my own personal treasure hunt . I mean , what am I going to find today ? Is it going to be my size ? Will I like the color ? Will it be under $ 20 ? If all the answers are yes , I feel as though I 've won . I want to get back to my suitcase and tell you what I packed for this exciting week here at TED . I mean , what does somebody with all these outfits bring with her ?

Critique of the Gotha Programme -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 1 . "" Labor is the source of wealth and all culture , and since useful labor is possible only in society and through society , the proceeds of labor belong undiminished with equal right to all members of society . "" First part of the paragraph : "" Labor is the source of all wealth and all culture . "" Labor is not the source of all wealth . Nature is just as much the source of use values ( and it is surely of such that material wealth consists ! ) as labor , which itself is only the manifestation of a force of nature , human labor power . the above phrase is to be found in all children's primers and is correct insofar as it is implied that labor is performed with the appurtenant subjects and instruments . But a socialist program can not allow such bourgeois phrases to pass over in silence the conditions that lone give them meaning . And insofar as man from the beginning behaves toward nature , the primary source of all instruments and subjects of labor , as an owner , treats her as belonging to him , his labor becomes the source of use values , therefore also of wealth . The bourgeois have very good grounds for falsely ascribing supernatural creative power to labor ; since precisely from the fact that labor depends on nature it follows that the man who possesses no other property than his labor power must , in all conditions of society and culture , be the slave of other men who have made themselves the owners of the material conditions of labor .

The sociologists had set up a stage to test the buying behavior of consumers in a busy department store . What they did was rather fiendish once you step back to take a look at the test . In the department store , they had set up a small stage with three stoves side-by-side . On each machine , they put a tag , which the customer was to take to the cash register for completion of their purchase . Next , they trained their hidden cameras to focus on the stoves and the activities of those folks who contemplated purchasing any of the machines . Additional hidden cameras were stationed at the checkout stand to correlate the purchaser to the purchase . At the end of one month , the sociologists gathered the tags that were taken to the cash register to make the determination as to which stoves were actually purchased . This is where we expose the fiendish scheme of these sociologists and the purpose of their test . Each of the three stoves was exactly the same ! The only difference between the three machines were the price differences on the stoves ! One was priced low , one was priced mid-range , and the other was priced expensive . Without fail , 20 % of all customers purchased the most expensive machine shown . For these people , few took the time to examine the differences between the units . Again without fail , another 20 % spent little time studying the differences between the stoves , and then opted to buy the cheapest one shown . The people who conducted the test were astonished to note that most people studied the stoves with extreme care as if to learn the difference between the machines",1.0

FAQ How does H & M check that suppliers abide by the Code of Conduct ? We employ full-time auditors whose job it is to check compliance with our Code of Conduct . During audits they go through a list containing over 300 points , relating to working conditions , the working environment , etc. After each audit we collate the results in a report that specifies the areas where improvements are needed , and the supplier is set a deadline for submitting an action plan . The auditors then visit the factories to follow up whether these actions have been taken . H & M also supports suppliers' improvement work through training and projects of various kinds . Read more about our Code of Conduct follow-up here . Is it possible to buy clothes produced with limited environmental impact at a good price ? H & M's business concept is to offer fashion and quality at the best price . We manage this by buying direct from the manufacturers , by having efficient logistics and by having our own stores – not by compromising on our environmental requirements . We are also cost-conscious at every stage and the fact is that a cheaper mode of transport – such as by ship – causes lower carbon dioxide emissions than more expensive means of transport , such as aircraft . So there is no conflict of interest between good prices and low climate impact . We make efforts to support our suppliers so that production takes place with consideration for the health of customers and workers as well as for the environment .

Timing Matters : How Social Influence Affects Adoption Pre - and Post-Product Release Sara B. Soderstrom , a Brian Uzzi , b Derek D. Rucker , b James H. Fowler , c Daniel Diermeierd a ) University of Michigan ; b ) Northwestern University ; c ) University of California , San Diego ; d ) University of Chicago Abstract : Social influence is typically studied after a product is released . Yet , audience expectations and discussions begin before a product's release . This observation suggests a need to understand adoption processes over a product's life cycle . To explore pre - and postrelease social influence processes , this article uses survey data from Americans exposed to word of mouth for 309 Hollywood movies released over two and a half years . The data suggest pre - and postrelease social influences operate differently . Prerelease social influence displays a critical transition point with relation to adoption : before a critical value , any level of social influence is negligibly related to adoption , but after the critical value , the relationship between social influence and adoption is large and substantive . In contrast , postrelease social influence exhibits a positive linear relationship with adoption . Prerelease social influence is argued to require more exposures than postrelease social influence because of differences in the diagnosticity and accessibility of the information . To complement the survey data , computational models are used to test alternative hypotheses . Evidence from the computational models supports the proposed model of social influence .

A How-To Guide for Purchasing Salvage Vehicles in Colorado Salvage yards are locations where vehicles that are worn out because of usage , cars that are no longer usable on the road , or vehicles that have been marked salvage by the state are kept . In addition , salvage yards in Colorado and other states are a destination for cars which have been seized by the state , an insurance company , or a financier . These institutions may repossess a vehicle from its owner because the owner defaulted on tax payments . Salvage yards may also house cars which have been recovered from crime scenes or have been found stolen . It may be difficult for the institutions that have seized the cars to maintain and store these vehicles because storing cars is an expensive endeavor . Said institutions may find it easier to sell off these cars to salvage yards in Colorado and other states to save costs . Therefore , salvage yards also house relatively new cars , which are brought to the site by these companies to be sold to new buyers for a cheaper price . The problem with newer salvage cars may be that their bumper is broken or their tail lights are smashed because of dangerous driving or from mishandling . There are numerous salvage yards in Colorado , and each of these yards also hosts their own website . If a potential buyer needs to locate salvage yards in Colorado , one simply needs to consult the yellow pages or go online and search for the salvage yard closest to one's vicinity . If one is interested in buying a car from a salvage yard in Colorado , one should follow a few steps . Firstly , one needs to register",1.0

Friday , 26 October 2012 "" first they came ... "" another extradition controversy The latest controversy revolving around extradition to the US comes hot on the heels of the resolution of another two . First came the extradition of Abu Hamza and four associates – the convicted terrorist's sermons inspired 9 / 11 plotter Zacarias Moussaoui as well as would-be shoe-bomber Richard Reid . Lawyers defended the eight-year long process by saying it shows Britain's determination to be fair . While Abu Qatada was often free to roam and preach hate-sermons during his extradition process and Gary MacKinnon lived at home , Robinson is being held alongside Muslim prisoners . British Freedom leader Paul Weston was also detained , when he refused to leave the reception area of Wormwood Scrubs prison without news of Tommy's whereabouts and safety . ( Can anybody now doubt that habeas corpus no longer exists ? ) Tommy Robinson neither preaches hate sermons nor encourages others to be violent . He has never compromised another country's defence . So if you are reading this I hope you will find his arrest sinister and disturbing , regardless of your views on the English Defence League . At the very least follow his case and , if his extradition should be placed on the fast track , ask yourself how you 'll fare when it 's your turn to stand up against the British Establishment . 1 comment : Can we see some paper work of freezing of funds , denial of legal help , costs awarded to the Police ( 11th Sept ) .

11 Total energy in the DRF model The total energy in the DRF model is may be partitioned in various contributions : energy of the quantum system This is the energy of the quantum-mechanical system , as calculated with the supported wave functions . Any change in energy upon interaction with the classical system is to be measured against a vacuum calculation on the quantum-mechanical system . energy of the classical system This is the energy of the classical system , calculated as if there were no QM system present . The zero of energy depends on the specification of the classical system ; for example , atoms may be defined to be part of molecules , excluding their interactions , making the infinitely separate molecules defining the zero of energy , rather than infinitely separate atoms . In this energy interactions between classical subsystems ( e.g. molecules ) are included . They may be electrostatic , dispersion , repulsion , and induction interactions . interaction energy This is the sum of all separable interaction energies : electrostatic interactions : interactions between point charges in the classical system and the QM charge distribution ( nuclei and electrons ) . Induction Interactions , also called screening . This is the interaction of one subsystem with the reaction field induced by another subsystem . The interaction of the subsystem with its own reaction field is also part of the interaction , and is used to calculate the polarization energy , which is half the energy gain from induction at equilibrium . dispersion interactions : an estimate of the dispersion energy between QM and classical subsystems , based upon the Second-order Perturbation ( SOP ) expression for the dispersion interaction , may be calculated ( see also section 12.4 ) . model repulsion",1.0

Rabbits are social animals and should therefore preferably be kept in pairs or groups , ideally reared together from birth . When you get a new rabbit or a pair of rabbits together , it is wise to get one , or ideally both , of the rabbits neutered . If opposite gender rabbits are kept together with no intention of breeding then one or both will need to be neutered from 4 months old . Watch for the male's testicles to descend from 3 months old and separate the rabbits immediately this is seen , keeping them in sight and sound of each other . At Wendover Heights Veterinary Centre , our vets and nurses are experienced with rabbit anaesthesia and surgery , and we will be happy to discuss with you what having your rabbit neutered involves . Reasons for spaying Does : prevention of pregnancy if kept with male prevention of uterine cancer ( some statistics suggest as many as 80 % of entire does may develop uterine cancer over 5 years of age ) to eliminate aggression which may develop at puberty to eliminate false pregnancy to prevent spraying if kept indoors The best age is 5-6 months old . Reasons for castrating Bucks : to prevent pregnancy if kept with a Doe to reduce aggression to prevent spraying if kept indoors The best age is as soon as the testicles descend into the scrotum , around 4 months old . Remember that Bucks may still be fertile for about a month after castration .

A new-comer of any age or either sex was an im - pressive curiosity in the poor little shabby village of St. Petersburg . This boy was well dressed , too -- well dressed on a week-day . This was simply as - tounding . His cap was a dainty thing , his close - buttoned blue cloth roundabout was new and natty , and so were his pantaloons . He had shoes on -- and it was only Friday . He even wore a necktie , a bright bit of ribbon . He had a citified air about him that ate into Tom's vitals . The more Tom stared at the splendid marvel , the higher he turned up his nose at his finery and the shabbier and shabbier his own outfit seemed to him to grow . Neither boy spoke . If one moved , the other moved -- but only sidewise , in a circle ; they kept face to face and eye to eye all the time . Finally Tom said : "" I can lick you ! "" "" I 'd like to see you try it .

Stellar Evolution Stellar evolution is a description of the way that stars change with time . On human timescales , most stars do not appear to change at all , but if we were to look for billions of years , we would see how stars are born , how they age , and finally how they die . The primary factor determining how a star evolves is its mass as it reaches the main sequence . The following is a brief outline tracing the evolution of a low-mass and a high-mass star . The life of a star Stars are born out of the gravitational collapse of cool , dense molecular clouds . As the cloud collapses , it fragments into smaller regions , which themselves contract to form stellar cores . These protostars rotate faster and increase in temperature as they condense , and are surrounded by a protoplanetary disk out of which planets may later form . The central temperature of the contracting protostar increases to the point where nuclear reactions begin . At this point , hydrogen is converted into helium in the core and the star is born onto the main sequence . For about 90 % of its life , the star will continue to burn hydrogen into helium and will remain a main sequence star . Once the hydrogen in the core has all been burned to helium , energy generation stops and the core begins to contract . This raises the internal temperature of the star and ignites a shell of hydrogen burning around the inert core . Meanwhile , the helium core continues to contract and increase in temperature , which leads to an increased energy generation rate in the hydrogen shell . This causes the star to expand enormously and",1.0

Contributions have risen from £ 5 . 3bn to £ 6bn in a year Employers' contributions to pension schemes have risen by 25 % during the past two years , according to research published on Monday . PENSIONS IN CRISIS 75 % of final salary schemes will close within five years ( Hermes ) Only a fifth of people under 34 are concerned about their future retirement ( Mercer ) People from ethnic minorities are at higher risk of pensioner poverty ( Pensions Minister ) Get more from BBC News Online's pensions website And in the past year they increased to £ 6bn from £ 5 . 3bn , the survey of 339 schemes suggested . Incomes Data Services said its study showed the "" vast scale "" of company money flowing into pension schemes . However , IDS says the rise is nothing to do with generosity on the part of the companies concerned . Instead , it reflects the way many companies took £ 18bn in "" pension holidays "" during the 1990s boom , using the rising price of investments to justify halting their contributions or even taking money out of their funds . More than a quarter of the total payout in the 24 months under review was for "" special contributions "" , to make up for shortfalls and to cover early retirement and other contingencies . Those "" special contributions "" account for more than the total rise in overall contributions . Radical action The survey also highlights the fact that one out of every 10 schemes receive no employer contributions at all . Pensions have become a major concern of trade unions following the closure of many schemes that guaranteed employees a fixed proportion of their final salaries on retirement . And Britain's",1.0

Nature of problem : The problem treated is the analysis of the effect , on the detected AC signals , of imperfections in and misalignment of the optical components of a polarization-modulation ellipsometer . This permits correction of the values of psi and delta ( characteristics of the sample surface ) for systematic error , estimation of the uncertainty in the final result , and identification of the most significant sources of experimental error . Solution method : The transmitted amplitude vector is computer using the Jones matrices of the individual components . The modified Jones matrices introduced by O ' Handley are used to separate the DC and AC components of the detected intensity .

Because we live in a society where everything is fast paced – where folks are always on the go and yearning for the opportunity to decide how they 'd like to watch TV , video or listen to music – accessibility has become very important to ones living . A large number of Web TV services have sprung up over the web with the arrival of web technology that continues to steam forward to meet consumer needs . The way things use to be during the past when consumers were limited to their TVs is not the case nowadays . Give thanks to Internet connecting mobile devices and computers that let you download apps / software to get fast , easy access to all kinds of free content , or at minimal cost , across the world . Take for example a service like iSatelliteLink that offers software which can be downloaded to any Windows-based desktop or laptop with a wireless or preferred broadband web connection . And they provide more accessibility when offering a 3 in 1 package consisting of TvonPC , mobile compatibility , and legal film downloads . Now consumers can watch whatever they desire , on the go , without the utilization of a TV-set . Where technology is today one can only guess what lies ahead , as leading edge technology raises the bar and continues to gear itself toward the web . There 's something you can be certain of – More paid TV subscribers will cut the cord or dish and opt for the cheapest route , even if it implies giving up some of the higher quality to some extent . In turn , they will get fast and easy access to their favourite content from any location and that 's where",1.0

Despite the Iraq precedent , the odds are against a US attack on Iran any time soon .

Given the Iraq precedent , and with senior US officials now regularly coming forward with similarly dire warnings about the Iranian threat , Europeans are understandably inclined to believe reports such as those recently published by Seymour Hersh in the New Yorker that Washington is getting ready to bomb Iran , possibly even with tactical nuclear weapons . It would be foolish to take these concerns lightly . President Bush has vowed never to ' permit the world's most dangerous regimes to threaten us with the world's most destructive weapons , ' and he has proven to be a leader willing to implement his threats even in the face of considerable international and domestic opposition . He may be convinced that only he has the courage to deal with the Iranian nuclear threat and that only an American military attack can reliably do so once diplomatic efforts have been tried and failed .

Just as injuries vary , so do our tolerance levels . Some people can be very uncomfortable with a smaller injury and need more medication to get by , while others may have a higher tolerance and need very little assistance . Learning and applying the techniques needed in order to find relief often takes time . Medical professionals are available to teach patients these techniques and help them learn the skills that will better help them cope . Many people rely on medications and often they are helpful . But there are still other ways to relieve the issue and find comfort without always depending on pills . Addiction to prescription drugs is often a worry and an added danger . The longer a patient takes pain medication , the less effective it becomes . Before long it takes more medication to cover the same amount of pain . The patient becomes dependent and therefore relies on it much more so as time goes on . There are a number of tools that one could use to find relief . Many use ice packs or heating pads , while others may find more comfort with stretching exercises . Learning how to best use the variety of tools available provides the patient with a feeling of control and empowerment . Others find a more relaxing way of coping . Emotional exercises are very beneficial . Relaxation techniques have long been encouraged for patients . Knowing how to apply these exercises in a busy world also takes some practice .

It was very natural and they made it really good fun . They 're really cool guys and it was good because I managed to put my own team around me .

Performance of a Contrarotating Small Wind Energy Converter 1 . Introduction Wind energy has been shown to be one of the most feasible sources of renewable energy . It presents attractive opportunities to a wide range of people , including investors and entrepreneurs . The main goal of wind energy industry is to minimize the cost of wind energy in order to make it more competitive compared to other energy sources . How to reduce the cost of wind energy is a vital engineering challenge presented by the interlocking disciplines of aerodynamics , structure , control , electrical conversion , and electronics . In fact , technologies in these related areas are still under active research and development to achieve high efficiency and low cost . In the shadows of advancing multimegawatt wind turbines is another growing sector within this industry , the small wind turbines . Small wind energy converters ( SWECs ) for urban or rural applications range in size from a few hundred watts to thousands of watts ( usually with a rated capacity of less than 100 kW ) and can be applied economically for a variety of power demands . These systems can be used in connection with an electricity transmission and distribution system , or in stand-alone applications that are not connected to the utility grid and are appropriate for homes , farms , or even entire communities . Investments in this sector are feasible not as stand-alone only , but as components of an integrated power-generating system that include various forms of energy resources . The main technical challenges for SWECs are the design of a system that has maximum efficiency in turbulent low speed winds ; ability to comply with both efficiency expectations and the requirements of grid utilities ; and have",1.0

Posted on Nov 20th , 2011 . 8 comments Despite what you may have heard from various small-minded people in my past , I am not the one who ruined Christmas . But I do know how to save it . First , about these vicious rumors , let me say that I 've always been a stalwart supporter of Christmas and Hanukkah and any other holiday you might choose to celebrate this time of year . True , we usually order take-out on December 25 , but from the good Chinese place , not the much cheaper but bad Chinese place we order from on other days . But if there 's no turkey on our dining room table during the holidays , it 's not because we hate Christmas . It 's because we have no dining room table – a situation related to the fact that we also have no dining room . That 's how we roll in Sucker Lake . Possibly , you once had us over for dinner , and now several years or perhaps a couple decades later , you 're still wondering why we did n't reciprocate . The answer's simple . It 's because no matter how good a friend / cook / host you are , it 's not worth a $ 25 , 000 + addition to our house just to have a place to set a table we do n't own with china we do n't have and food we do n't know how to cook .

Tel-Aviv District Court Finds No "" Right to Forget "" As reported by Dan Or-Hof , Manager of the Information Technology , Internet and Copyright group at the Israeli law firm of Pearl Cohen Zedek & Latzer , in a first of its kind decision , the Tel-Aviv district court ruled on November 30 , 2010 that a subscriber of cellular services does not have a general right to have his phone records deleted . Cellular providers maintain and store , as a general practice , a record of the calls made by their subscribers . The phone records include lists of phone numbers called , received calls , call durations and calls dates and time . The right to privacy is a fundamental ( semi-constitutional ) right under Israel's Freedom and Human Dignity Basic Law . In addition , the Privacy Protection Act sets a balance between the right to privacy and other rights and legitimate interests and regulates data protection . The Act provides , in relevant part , that a person may use data stored in a database the person owns only if ( i ) the database is lawfully registered and ( ii ) any use of the data is consistent with the database's registered purposes . The plaintiff , Amir Liran , a subscriber of two cellular providers ( Pelephone and Partner ) , filed a civil action against the providers , on grounds that they unlawfully retained his subscriber's phone records for periods of 8 to 10 years , respectively . The plaintiff argued that cellular providers store phone records for billing purposes only , and as soon as a subscriber pays for the calls he made , the relevant phone records should not be retained .

Definitions vary , though everyone seems to agree that the muscles of the trunk form the basis of the "" core "" . At its simplest , it might be helpful to visualise the core as a cylinder , with a wide corset-like band running around the central part of the torso . The muscles of the lower spine form the rear of the cylinder , while the abdominal muscles make up the front . The pelvic floor forms the bottom of the cylinder and the thoracic diaphragm ( found just below the lungs ) can be thought of as the top . Other muscles in the back , bottom and even legs are often credited with contributing to this picture , but let 's keep it simple for now . so what does the core do ? The muscles of the core have many different functions - too many ( and in some cases , too intimate ! ) to examine in detail in this brief summary . Posturally speaking , the core muscles work together in order to stabilise the spine , ribs and pelvis of the body . In doing so , they help to align the entire skeleton , keeping it aligned despite whatever external forces the body encounters . And that function of ' keeping things under control ' when moving ( i.e. resisting dynamic force ) is key . Without it , any movement , whether making a serve on the centre court at Wimbledon or reaching up to take something down from a high shelf , runs the risk of transferring unnecessary stress to the bones , joints and muscles of the spine . Over time , the cumulative effect of such uncorrected stresses and strains can lead to back pain . It",1.0

Role of stem cells and differentiated cells in the genesis of squamous cell carcinoma Fiona M Watt CR-UK London Research Institute , London , UK It is widely accepted that oncogenic mutations in stem cells are responsible for driving the development of epidermal tumours . Nevertheless , there is growing evidence that non-dividing cells that are undergoing differentiation can play a role in determining whether an epidermal tumour will progress or regress . In addition , communication between epidermal cells and cells of the immune system can affect tumour formation . In my talk I will discuss some of the mechanisms by which differentiated cells can influence squamous cell carcinoma formation . </doc>",1.0

The key link between the base / infrastructure and the superstructure in societies is established by the class relationships of the given society . It is the class relationships which act as the link between the economy and the politics and culture of a society . Specifically , Marx invokes the idea of the ' class-struggle ' . The class-struggle is the driving force of human history for Marx . History is a series of Modes of Production and in each of these ' Modes ' there are two fundamental classes which are in conflict with each other . In the present Mode of Production - called Capitalism - the two important classes are the capitalists - who own the means of production - and the proletariat ( working class to you and I ! ) - who have to sell their labour-power . Marx suggested that it was important to recognise the inequalities of social power in the relationship between these two classes . The capitalists , as a result of their ownership of the means of production , are the dominant class . This power allows this class to exploit the other class - the proletariat . Importantly , because of this exploitation the working classes are said to be alienated . To be alienated means to feel distant from or to feel estranged from one's community or social world . For Marx the workers feel alienated from the production process by virtue of the fact that they do not own it and therefore do not make decisions regarding what to produce and how to produce it . In fact Marx suggests that even the capitalist class will be alienated . This is a result of the fact that the capitalist production process is geared to the goal",1.0

CORE MESSAGE AREA : READING / LITERACY Introduction : The revision of the Reading / Literacy Core Messages was based on significant advances in the national research community concerning best practices to improve reading and literacy ( reading , writing , speaking , and listening across the curriculum areas ) . Two critical examples are the National Institute of Education Sciences 1 and the What Works Clearinghouse 2 , which provide resources to objectively evaluate programs and practices according to accepted rules of science . In addition , the creation of national Common Core Standards 3 along with the move towards organizing interventions in a Response to Intervention ( RTI ) 4 framework have created exciting and challenging new opportunities for improving outcomes for California's students . It is important to note that Reading is a part of the larger context of Academic Literacy . Academic Literacy is defined as the skills of reading / writing / speaking and listening that all work together across the content areas . This unified concept is clearly aligned with the Common Core Standards that use reading and literacy across the curricular areas and present both as a shared teaching responsibility . </doc>",1.0

Form PF is the documentation used by the Securities and Exchange Commission and other regulators to understand the financial health of a hedge fund and the effects its potential collapse might have on the overall economy . The largest private fund managers were required to submit the form as of late August following their registration with the SEC mandated under the U.S. financial reform legislation . The largest alternative fund managers are required to update the information quarterly and have a lot more sections on the document to fill out than the smallest fund managers which must only provide the basics on annual updates . Kaal , who teaches international finance , did not ask hedge fund managers specifically about their responses to Form PF so he offered no hard core numbers to back his stance . The information , he tells www.iss-mag.com was provided during discussions with attendees of conferences where the paper was presented . "" No one wanted to clarify just what the phrase flatten out meant , "" explains Kaal . "" It was the exact wording they used in discussing how they responded to PF which suggests that they took advantage of the SEC allowing them some leeway in how they would answer some of the questions . "" A random survey of about a dozen hedge fund compliance executives conducted by www.iss-mag.com on Wednesday also provided little insight into how US hedge funds might have presented information on Form PF . None wanted to publicly elaborate , but privately gave credence to Kaal's "" anecdotal evidence , "" saying they "" hedged "" their answers when necessary to provide as little information as possible which would expose their trading strategies to competitors if it fell in the wrong hands .

Women in focus : Crime and justice The police returned details on 26,000 incidents of domestic abuse recorded between April and December 1999 . However , the majority of incidents recorded ( 57 % ) comprised behaviour that did not lead to the recording of a crime or offence . If an incidence of domestic abuse did lead to a crime or offence being recorded , the most common occurrence was a recording of an offence of petty assault ( 21 % of all incidents ) or breach of the peace ( 18 % of all incidents ) . Crimes which are generally regarded as more serious than offences , were only recorded in respect of 5 % of all incidents . Where a crime was recorded , it was likely to be vandalism ( 1 . 6 % of all incidents ) or , a non-sexual crime of violence ( 1 . 5 % of all incidents ) . Males accounted for 87 % of all convictions in 1999 : more males than females were convicted for almost all crime and offence categories . The main exception to this was "" other "" crimes of indecency , where females accounted for 82 % of what are mainly offences related to prostitution . The other categories where females formed a higher than average proportion of those convicted included shoplifting ( 28 % ) , "" other theft "" ( 21 % ) , and the "" other "" miscellaneous offences category ( 15 % ) . The latter category mainly relates to non-payment of a television licence .

Argument Paper "" Are you hot ? Are you cold ? Are you wearing that ? Where 's your books and your lunch and your homework at ? Grab your coat and your gloves and your scarf and hat . Do n't forget ; you got to feed the cat ! "" ( 1 ) Anita Renfroe wrote these catchy words for the song "" Momisms "" , sung to the familiar tune of the William Tell Overture . Her words best describe a typical day of mayhem through the eyes of a mother . Mothers who stay at home know that at times , their lives can be discombobulating . Despite the chaos , stay-at-home mothers get the tremendous responsibility of only having one chance of raising their children in such a way that makes a difference in their children's lives and in society . Throughout history , society has looked upon the male as the breadwinner : the one expected to work and support the family . The mother has been viewed as the nurturer : the one to stay home and raise the children . During the 1960's , women wanted more rights , power , and the ability to get higher paying jobs . Women were given this right so they expressed this new found freedom by going to work outside of the home . As women sought employment , their children were left to the care of babysitters and day care workers . Because society has redefined the role of a mother to be one who is an important element in the workforce , the loss of the mother in the home has led to the decline of the family unit , and thus , to society .

"" There 's an unbalanced relationship between online advertisers and Internet users – who are basically not in control of their own data , "" points out Tristan Nitot , head of Mozilla Europe . As individual people , such asthe US student who mounted a Kickstarter campaign to sell his own data , become increasingly aware of the financial value of their digital trail , new international players are emerging , offering Internet users the means to take back ownership of their personal information . New players in the personal data market According to a report from the Boston Consulting G roupentitled ' The Value of Our Digital Identity ' , the total value of personal data for organisations ( € 330 billion ) and individuals ( € 670 billion ) will amount to a trillion euros by 2020 . "" Users will increasingly gravitate to the centre of this market , especially with the advance of the Quantified Self movement , "" predicts Gerald Bäck , co-founder of Archify , a now defunct platform set up to help people keep their digital records for their own use rather than that of advertisers .

Introduction This paper is written from the perspective of a long-serving expatriate classroom practitioner working in the Arab Gulf , and is based on a presentation given at the 2013 Fourth Annual Gulf Comparative Education Symposium . It offers a critical examination of Kennedy's ( 2001 ) model of Language Policy and Planning , explaining how that model operates within the Arab Gulf educational context , but simultaneously questioning Kennedy's relegation of teachers to the category of "" variables "" . The paper argues that teachers ought to be regarded as far more than delivery agents who are tasked with passing on a set curriculum to a homogenous student population , and guaranteeing results that will satisfy the demands of external stakeholders . It suggests that truly dedicated teachers share specific inspirational qualities , and have also adopted recognizable "" best practices "" that make then central to the entire educational process .

I am a serving classroom teacher , or classroom practitioner if you want to use a fancier euphemism . I began teaching in 1972 , and in the last 40 years , one thing that has remained unchanged is the contempt that many employers , managers and stakeholders demonstrate when dealing with classroom practitioners .

Oscar De La Hoya vs. Manny Pacquiao , also billed as The Dream Match , was a professional boxing welterweight superfight . The bout took place on December 6 , 2008 at the MGM Grand Garden Arena , Las Vegas , Nevada , United States . Pacquiao defeated De La Hoya via technical knockout when De La Hoya decided not to continue with the fight before the start of the ninth round . The card was a co-production of Bob Arum ' s Top Rank Boxing and De La Hoya's Golden Boy Promotions and was aired live on pay-per-view ( PPV ) on HBO PPV . The fight is notable for propelling Manny Pacquiao to full-blown superstar status in much of the western world ( mostly in The United States ) , as Oscar De La Hoya symbolically "" passed the torch "" , so to speak , to Pacquiao . Despite no title belts being disputed , the bout received a lot of publicity since the two boxers were decorated , with Pacquiao being the current number one pound for pound boxer in the world as judged by The Ring , and a five-time world champion in five different weight divisions ( Pacquiao was the reigning WBC lightweight champion at the time of the bout ) . Meanwhile , De La Hoya was an Olympic gold medalist and past holder of 10 world titles in six weight divisions . Pacquiao had to step up two weight divisions ( from lightweight ) , and De La Hoya had to go down one weight division ( from light middleweight ) , to be eligible for the bout's welterweight division . The ideas of having De La Hoya and Pacquiao fight came from HBO boxing analyst Larry Merchant talking with ESPN boxing",1.0

Just my daily ramblings and personal experiences of running a busy business and surviving Monday , April 3rd , 2006 Stressed Out I did too much thinking last night and stressed myself out so much that I cracked about 1am . I currently have a lot of work on , I 'm slowly clearing my list of things to do but there 's still a lot there . I currently contract for a company in Cardiff and I feel really bad that I 've not been working my full hours for them . They provide and will continue to provide a lot of work to me whilst I develop web based systems for them and also one of my closest friends works there , who got me the job , and I really do n't want to cause her or anyone else issues . I also decided to redevelop a major site of a client 's , my exboss to be accurate , and I 'd hoped to get it all finished off in March , however due to other various work I 've not even started it which has really upset me . So I spent yesterday evening in Dave's arms upset and highly stressed not really knowing what to do . I know it 's just because I 've let it all get on top of me and get too much , right now there 's very little light at the end of the tunnel , but once this clears I definitely wo n't let it happen again . This year has flown by and it just seems that I 'm barely making any dent in my pile of work . "" Filed under Business by Sarah at 10 : 54 . </doc>",1.0

Fifty-eighth session Agenda item 9 Note verbale dated 28 March 2002 from the Permanent Mission of Armenia to the United Nations Office at Geneva addressed to the secretariat of the Commission on Human Rights The Permanent Mission of the Republic of Armenia to the United Nations Office and other international organizations at Geneva presents its compliments to the secretariat of the Commission on Human Rights and has the honour to request that the attached * information be circulated as an official document of the fifty-eighth session of the Commission under agenda item 9 , "" Question of the violation of human rights and fundamental freedoms in any part of the world "" . * The annex is reproduced as received in the language of submission and in English only . Annex More than 14 years have passed since Sumgait . Sufficient time for a full appraisal of the gravity of this tragic event for the Armenian people . The events of Sumgait were a natural consequence of the atmosphere of total lawlessness , in which the Azerbaijani leaders spurred on the zealots in the country and incited them to further Sumgait-like atrocities . Whipped up into a state of nationalist histeria , the deceived masses perpetrated vicious crimes , burning people alive , demonstrating how easily entire multitudes could be reft of any semblance of humanity and many hundreds of people transformed into bloodthirsty sadists . Yet what is possibly still more monstrous than these barbarous acts is the way that the fine upstanding citizens entrusted with the reins of power in the republic and in the country did everything they could to conceal the truth about Sumgait and to shelter the culprits from justice . The impunity enjoyed by the instigators and organizers of the Sumgait pogrom is proof",1.0

I do n't have much to add to the discussion of metal bending because I do n't do that ( yet ) , but I must say that this has been a VERY informative thread , especially with Dan and Craig's exchanges . Ever since I 've "" jumped "" onto the Mentalism bandwagon , I 've realised just how hard it is . FYI , I did not jump on any bandwagon . That was a just a joke . Mentalism is something I really enjoy and have a passion for . It is very tough to do it right and I know I have a long way to go , but I 'm trying my best to get there eventually . I 've already lost track of the number of times I 've take risks doing mentalism for people and screwing up the effect . Thankfully most of these are to fellow members of my local magic society , so I 'm using this experience to learn and prepare myself for actual public performances . There are so many aspects I still need work on that sometimes I do wish I have a mentor helping me out . Anyway , just wanted to say that this thread is great . _________________ "" Trust the tale , not the teller . "" - D.H. Lawrence </doc>",1.0

The main purpose of BioAssess - the Biodiversity Assessment Tools project - is to develop biodiversity indicators - or "" biodiversity assessment tools "" - that can be used to rapidly assess biodiversity . In addition , the BioAssess project will measure the impacts on biodiversity of major land use change in eight European countries . Background : We desperately need tools to monitor change in Europe's biodiversity - never before has biodiversity been so threatened , particularly through pressures such as land use change ( e.g. urbanization , forest clearance and agricultural intensification ) , pollution , climate change and invasive species . These pressures , particularly land use change , are sensitive to EU policies . In Europe a range of instruments are intended to conserve biodiversity , notably the Convention of Biological Diversity ( CBD ) , which the EU and all its Member States are parties to , the European Biodiversity Strategy , the Birds and Habitats Directives and a range of Biodiversity Action Plans from local to national and European scales . Most EU policies are not designed to conserve biodiversity but they may , nevertheless , influence biodiversity . The Common Agricultural Policy , for example , undoubtedly affects Europe's biodiversity . Despite the many threats to biodiversity , we have a very poor understanding of their actual impact . In addition , we do not know how effective are the many policies now in place to conserve biodiversity . The reason for the deficient knowledge and understanding is that we have yet to develop effective ways of monitoring biodiversity and , in some parts of Europe , much of its biodiversity is largely undescribed . This problem is widely acknowledged and is explicitly included in , amongst other places , the CBD .",1.0

You want to join in but know you ca n't . Because you ca n't use the playground equipment . Because they forgot to include you . Because you have a disability . There are over 700,000 children under the age of 18 in Britain . Only a quarter of primary schools and 10 % of secondary schools are accessible to disabled children . Disabled children are three times more likely to be abused and neglected than non-disabled children . Every child needs to be heard , but disabled children are rarely consulted in decisions that affect their lives . Discrimination , abuse and lack of educational opportunities are facts of life for these children and all too often they are excluded from mainstream society . At The Children's Society we work with disabled children to ensure their voices are heard , that they can participate fully in everyday activities and have access to the services they want and need . With your support disabled children can learn to deal with the discrimination they face and ensure their views and wishes are respected .

From largest to smallest , the three waterfalls are the Horseshoe Falls , the American Falls and the Bridal Veil Falls . The Horseshoe Falls lie mostly on the Canadian side and the American Falls entirely on the American side , separated by Goat Island . The smaller Bridal Veil Falls are also on the American side , separated from the other waterfalls by Luna Island . The international boundary line was originally drawn through Horseshoe Falls in 1819 , but the boundary has long been in dispute due to natural erosion and construction . [ 1 ] Niagara Falls were formed when glaciers receded at the end of the Wisconsin glaciation ( the last ice age ) , and water from the newly formed Great Lakes carved a path through the Niagara Escarpment en route to the Atlantic Ocean . While not exceptionally high , the Niagara Falls are very wide . More than six million cubic feet ( 168 , 000 m 3 ) of water falls over the crest line every minute in high flow , [ 3 ] and almost four million cubic feet ( 110 , 000 m 3 ) on average . The Niagara Falls are renowned both for their beauty and as a valuable source of hydroelectric power . Balancing recreational , commercial , and industrial uses has been a challenge for the stewards of the falls since the 19th century . The Horseshoe Falls drop about 188 feet ( 57 m ) , [ 4 ] while the height of the American Falls varies between 70 and 100 feet ( 21 and 30 m ) because of the presence of giant boulders at its base . The larger Horseshoe Falls are about 2,600 feet ( 790 m ) wide , while the",1.0

The May / June ' 06 issue carried an article on the history of run-ins between morays and divers near Stingray City and the Sand Bar in Grand Cayman's North Sound ( "" It 's A Moray . . . You Do n't Always Get What You Feed "" ) . The run-ins have continued sporadically . Despite repeated requests by the Cayman Island's Department of the Environment ( DoE ) that watersports operators refrain from feeding or encouraging interaction with green morays , this practice continues . "" After all , divers and local operators have enjoyed this practice for many years , "" said a DAN Member who recently traveled to Cayman . "" Many of us feel that an occasional bite is worth the interaction . We 're dealing with wild creatures here ; that 's part of the thrill of diving with them . "" According to Cayman News Net , on Oct. 11 , 2006 , in an area off the Sand Bar known as "" the reef , "" a dive guide played with a moray for the entertainment of his diving customers . Apparently aware of possible danger , he reportedly told his group to cross their arms and clench their fists if the creature approached . The customer who recounted this incident noted that several of those on the tour were given squid to feed the eel . At some point , the guide , who was also the captain , was bitten on the arm severely enough to incapacitate him and require multiple surgeries and several days' hospitalization . The May 2006 article noted that the DoE was considering new approaches to manage such activities , including limiting the number of boats and people present at any one time , as",1.0

Tax Office intensifies attack on cash economy tax avoiders Unless you 've been holed up in a bunker , you would probably have heard about the ATO's campaign to unearth the perpetrators of tax avoidance . Labelled their ' cash economy ' drive and launched in 2009 , the ATO is on a crusade to quash tax avoidance , collect back-taxes with penalties , and bring everyone up to speed as to their responsibilities as to record keeping and maintaining adequate records . The ATO said , "" The cash economy occurs when people in business deliberately use cash transactions to hide income and evade tax obligations . We are making it harder for them to get away with not reporting cash income – making it fairer for everyone . "" ATO's cash economy campaign was recently elevated to a new level as The National Tax & Accountants' Association reported , "" There is no question that the Tax Office is continuing to turn up the heat on the cash economy and has now risk-profiled certain accounting / tax practices which can expect special attention . "" "" Anyone who thinks that the Tax Office wo n't expect the above from every tax agent in the near future must have rocks in their head , "" NTAA said . In other words , ATO suspects that some tax agents might be complicit in tax avoidance . Clearly the Tax Office is digging deeper and seeking to make examples , but there is no question that this activity will in some way affect every business owner . To strengthen their efforts , the ATO recently issued an update on their small business benchmarks and published six new industry benchmarks for landscape construction services , motor vehicle retailers ( new and used",1.0

In 2000 , for the first time in over a decade - some say for the first time ever - world-wide sales of music compact disks ( CDs ) fell . The following year the decline continued . The sale of CD singles in the US , for example , dropped by almost 40 % in 2000 , the US experiencing a further 10 % fall in music sales in 2001 ( Harmon , 2002 ) . Indeed , only France and Britain have so far bucked this world-wide downward trend , in the latter's case , partly thanks to the huge success of artists such as Robbie Williams and Dido . But with recent reports suggesting that the value of UK music shipments dropped by 3.7 % last year to £ 1 . 2bn , even the previously buoyant British market now appears to be in decline ( Cassy , 2003 : 22 ) . All of which has left music industry chiefs frantically scrabbling for explanations . Among the most popular put forward to date are the slowing down of the world economy , the increase in popularity of CD ' rewriters ' , which enable individuals to make their own ' pirate ' CDs , and the fact that most people have by now long since replaced their old vinyl recordings of Phil Collins ' ' In the Air Tonight ' with a compact disk version . But there is another explanation , one with far more profound potential consequences for the music industry : the Napster effect . Napster is a software tool for sharing MP3 files .

The National Biodiversity Network ( NBN ) is home to all information on the nation's biodiversity . You can find the Local Biodiversity Action Plan ( LBAP ) for your area from www . b iodiversityscotland . o rg or www . s earchnbn . n et The involvement of the people of Scotland is essential if we are to conserve biodiversity for today and the future . Across Scotland , people are taking action for biodiversity in their own ' back yard ' . Local Biodiversity Action Plan partnerships have been set up , involving government agencies , national and local voluntary bodies and community groups all working together . Local wildlife sites are being managed , greenspace networks established and gardens made more wildlife friendly . Public bodies are looking to include action for biodiversity in their everyday activities . Wherever you live in Scotland , there are opportunities to get involved in biodiversity conservation locally . Twenty-four Local Biodiversity Action Plans ( LBAPs ) cover the country from Shetland in the north to Galloway in the south and from the Western Isles / Na h-Eileanan Siar in the west to Aberdeen in the east . Each LBAP is overseen by a partnership of national and local organisations , some of which also contribute funding to the project . In most cases core funding is provided by SNH and the Local Authority , with a variety of other organisations contributing in different circumstances . One or more LBAP Officers may be employed ( usually by one of the partner organisations - most often the Local Authority ) to promote and co-ordinate activities . In some areas , the additional post is a Community Biodiversity Officer , with a specific remit to encourage community involvement in the LBAP .",2.0

The Iranian Nuclear Threat Goes Global Itamar Rabinovich 2012-02-16 TEL AVIV – The current drive to prevent Iran from developing a nuclear arsenal reflects two important , and interrelated , changes . From Israel's perspective , these changes are to be welcomed , though its government must remain cautious about the country's own role . The first change is the escalation of efforts by the United States and its Western allies to abort the Iranian regime's nuclear quest . This was instigated in part by the International Atomic Energy Agency's finding in November 2011 that Iran is indeed developing a nuclear weapon , and that it is getting perilously close to crossing the "" red line "" – the point beyond which its progress could no longer be stopped . Moreover , the US and its allies understand that failure to take serious action might prompt Israel to launch its own unilateral military offensive . The second change is the perception that Iran's nuclear capacity would threaten not only Israel . In a speech to the Union for Reform Judaism in December , US President Barack Obama stated that "" another threat to the security of Israel , the US , and the world is Iran's nuclear program . "" But , by this February , Obama was saying of Iran that "" my number-one priority continues to be the security of the US , but also the security of Israel , and we continue to work in lockstep as we proceed to try to solve this ... "" That choice of words was no accident ; rather , it was a sign that the US is changing tack when it comes to Iran . For more than a decade , the question "" Whose issue is it ? """,2.0

General agreement that minutes will be accepted unless anyone objects before hand . Commercial Websites on Tov Tim told the exec that there was one commercial website being hosted out of Tov that he knew about . He asked whether this was firstly sensible and secondly whether this broke any terms of service either we or the user had to agree to . General exec opinion was that this was a difficult topic , potential problems included legal action for downtime which could be a large amount if there was a significant problem . This was even a problem despite terms of service not guaranteeing any service level . Action Si is to email Union with regards this issue and obtain a legal clarification Exec / TechTeam Policy Guidelines Si presented this point stating that under Equal Ops and he felt obligations to members , there were certain areas which the Exec needed to produce a guidelines or ' policy ' for the TechTeam to ensure that problems were minimised .

Primary care referral protocol for wrist ganglia . Postgrad Med J 2003 79 : 329-331 . Bandolier has a wrist ganglion in its midst : it comes and goes ( more or less ) and causes mild to moderate pain from time to time , but only occasionally interferes with life . What can , or should , be done about it ? It is said that in olden days the standard treatment was to hit it with the family bible ( the size of the book is probably more important than the content ) , but in the absence of good quality studies of this approach , Bandolier looked further afield . There are several small randomised controlled trials and observational studies , but no systematic reviews . There is , however , an excellent review from Derby [ 1 ] , which although it does not claim to be systematic , does cover the important studies . Background Ganglia are benign fluid-filled lumps , formed when synovial fluid escapes from a joint and collects in the superficial layers . The ganglion capsule is formed from compressed stroma , with no cellular lining , and may be linked to the underlying joint capsule by a narrow channel acting as a one-way valve . Their cause is unclear , and only a small minority give a history of previous trauma . They are the most common swellings of the wrist , occurring more often in women than men , and in these aged 20 to 50 years . Many untreated ganglia resolve spontaneously , with 50 % of patients """,2.0

At the hearing , several panelists addressed concerns that the bill , the Chemical Safety Improvement Act , threatens to override state and local chemical regulations that protect health and the environment without first putting in place a federal standard or setting a deadline by which EPA must take action . Michael A. Troncoso , Senior Counsel to the Attorney General of California , testified that the bill threatens California's Proposition 65 , which requires companies to inform consumers about significant quantities of certain toxic chemicals contained in products or building materials , as well as significant releases into the environment . Troncoso and panelists from Washington State and West Virginia agreed that meaningful TSCA reform should authorize EPA to issue a nationwide minimum standard while allowing states the option to adopt stronger standards . Vitter assured the committee and panelists that he is working to revise the preemption provisions in the legislation , but it remains unclear whether the changes will fully address these concerns . Witnesses also identified ambiguity in the bill's language on the safety standard EPA must employ when deciding whether to label , restrict , or outright ban a chemical . The current standard is widely believed to have fatally weakened TSCA , but the proposed Lautenberg-Vitter bill only removes part of the troubling language , leaving it unclear whether EPA would still be required to perform cost-benefit analysis when deciding how best to reduce an unreasonable health or environmental risk . Thomas McGarity , Professor of Law at the University of Texas at Austin , explained that "" Congress could eliminate the ambiguity ( and the need for more litigation ) . . . .

We believe in one God , who exists eternally in three persons , the Father , the Son , and the Holy Spirit We believe all people , being created in the image of God , have intrinsic value , but as a result of sin are alienated from God and each other , and therefore in need of reconciliation . We believe that Jesus Christ , the Son of God , born of the virgin Mary , is fully God and fully human ; He demonstrated God's love for sinners by suffering the penalty of death in their place , rose bodily from the dead and ascended to heaven where He intercedes for His people . We believe all who repent and trust in Jesus Christ alone as Lord and Saviour are , by the grace of God , declared to be right with Him , receiving forgiveness and eternal life . We believe the Lord Jesus Christ will return personally in glory , raise the dead , and judge the world . We believe all people will rise from the dead , those who are in Christ to enjoy eternal life with God , and those who are lost to suffer eternal separation from Him .

"" While this can be helpful for gaining a greater understanding of the complex world of digital media , we should n't lose sight of what makes digital so compelling – relative to more traditional channels . This industry was built on innovation , creativity , speed-to-market , and a collaborative drive to solve business challenges without constraints . The problem is n't that these buckets exist or create rigid lines of divide – they serve a purpose and help to simplify a complicated industry .

Quantity : Ancestral Trails . The Complete Guide to British Genealogy and Family History . Second Edition . Mark D. Herber with a Foreword by John Titford . 2006 , paper , Index , 896 pp. Ancestral Trails guides the researcher through the substantial British archives , giving a detailed view of the records and the published sources available , analyzing each record and guiding the searcher to finding-aids and indexes . The early chapters help beginners take their first steps by dealing with such matters as obtaining information from living relatives , drawing family trees , and starting research in the records of birth , marriage , and death , or in census records . Later chapters guide researchers to the records that are more difficult to find and use , such as wills , parish registers , civil and ecclesiastical court records , poll books , and property records . One of the aims of the book is to link sources together to ensure that researchers can use material found in one source to assist a search in other sources . Another aim is to bring the reader up-to-date with the many important changes that have taken place in English genealogy over the last few years . These changes include the movement of census records and the indexes of births , marriages , and deaths to the new Family Records Centre at 1 Myddelton Street , London ; the opening of the 1891 census ; the placement of parish registers in county record offices ; the transcription and indexing of census returns and parish records ; and county and regional boundary changes . The scope of Herber's work is so thorough that it 's worth looking at the table of contents , where chapter headings alone tell the",2.0

"" We were very pleased with the impact and awareness generated by the Transit Connect launch poster site campaign . There is no doubt that when used in conjunction with TV , specialist press and online activity , outdoor provides a measurable lift to your activities . "" John Knight , Communications Co-ordinator , Commercial Vehicle Brand Team , Ford of Britain The Ford Transit has an automatic place on the consideration list for medium commercial vehicles . The aim for the launch of the Ford Transit Connect was to do the same for its little brother in the light and sub one tonne markets . Outdoor worked alongside TV , specialist press and online activity to promote a message that focused on the new van1s strength and design . Using 96-sheet , 48-sheet and 6-sheet formats the campaign used the tagline "" toughness now comes in a brand new shape "" to promote the all-new Transit Connect . The slogan "" Job Done "" and the trademark tick used on Transit campaigns also tied the launch into the parent brand and emphasised the "" can-do "" functionality of the two models . The research looked to test the impact of the campaign and discover whether the Transit Connect had been recognised as part of the Transit brand and the overall Ford family . Campaign results The campaign reinforced Ford1s position as a major van manufacturer . It dominated responses to the question "" have you seen any advertising for van manufacturers ? "" , scoring 36.7 % well ahead of its rivals . Total spontaneous awareness of Ford van advertising hit 83.7 % after the campaign while the Ford Transit Connect activity scored 79.7 % . Outdoor played a key role in building this awareness with 44 % of",2.0

Throughout the life of the El Camino , ad images emphasized both its sporty profile and its pickup truck-style rear , which was perfect for hauling groceries , furniture , or the kid's bicycles . The powers-that-be at Chevrolet tweaked this "" all things to all men "" formula throughout the vehicle's production years . In 1968 , these efforts resulted in the introduction of an SS package . This was essentially a carbon copy of the Chevelle Super Sport's options , including Chevy's legendary Turbo Jet 396 cubic inch engine . With this V8 monster under its hood , the El Camino could wrap up the quarter-mile in 14 seconds – respectable for the time and not too bad by today's standards . There was one crucial difference between the Chevelle and El Camino SS packages , however . Try as they might , builders could not adapt the Chevelle's heavy-duty rear anti-sway suspension to the hybrid truck-sports car frame . This was due to the fact that the El Camino was originally designed to haul freight , not burn rubber . It points out the problems that inevitably arise when a company tries to please everyone . The El Camino SS came closer than any other attempt to bridge divide between rebellious youth and responsible adulthood , however . For that alone , it deserves its place in automotive history . </doc>",2.0

The DLR successfuly deployed a 20m2 sail structure in December of 1999 , a ground-based demonstrator that consisted of four booms made of carbon fiber reinforced plastic . In August of 2000 , DLR proposed a dedicated mission to explore near-Earth asteroids ( NEAs ) using a solar sail-driven spacecraft called ENEAS . The mission concept was to rendezvous with an object called 1996FG3 with a payload ( not counting the sail assembly ) of 75kg . Such proposals run into financial difficulties familiar to anyone who recalls NASA's early solar sail work for a Halley's Comet mission that never flew . Tight budgets have kept ambitious sail missions on the ground both within ESA and NASA , but concepts continue to multiply . A new paper by Bernd Dachwald and Wolfgang Seboldt at DLR proposes a mission called ENEAS-SR , a 70m2 sail designed to return a sample from NEA 1996FG3 within ten years of launch , carrying a 300 kg payload including lander and sample return capsule . Why , other than to shake out a new technology , should we go to a near-Earth asteroid ? In addition to pure science , NEAs are significant because they are probably fragments of main belt asteroids , and therefore representative of them . The larger class that contains them is the group called NEOs , those asteroids and comets with orbits that intersect or pass near the Earth's orbit . We need , say Dachwald and Seboldt , to know much more about them . From the paper : It is today widely accepted that NEO impacts have caused at least one mass extinction ( 65 million years ago at the Cretaceous / Tertiary boundary ) , and they are suspected to have caused several global catastrophes before .",2.0

Good afternoon . There 's a medical revolution happening all around us , and it 's one that 's going to help us conquer some of society's most dreaded conditions , including cancer . And the revolution is called angiogenesis , and it 's based on the process that our bodies use to grow blood vessels . So why should we care about blood vessels ? Well , the human body is literally packed with them , 60,000 miles worth in a typical adult . End to end , that would form a line that would circle the earth twice . The smallest blood vessels are called capillaries . We 've got 19 billion of them in our bodies . And these are the vessels of life , and , as I 'll show you , they can also be the vessels of death . Now the remarkable thing about blood vessels is that they have this ability to adapt to whatever environment they 're growing in . For example , in the liver they form channels to detoxify the blood . In the lung , they line air sacs for gas exchange . In muscle , they corkscrew so that muscles can contract without cutting off circulation . And in nerves , they course along like power lines , keeping those nerves alive . And we get most of these blood vessels when we 're actually still in the womb . And what that means is that , as adults , blood vessels do n't normally grow , except in a few special circumstances . In women , blood vessels grow every month to build the lining of the uterus . During pregnancy , they form the placenta , which connects mom and baby . And after injury ,",2.0

When asked to give my own experience about how the Lord came into my life ( Testimony ) , I have to say that although I do so with joy in my heart , I also give my story with sadness . Why ? Well it 's because when I look back over the last 12 years of my life as a child of God I see so many things wrong , that I wonder if a change came into my life at all . I do not say this to discourage anyone , I say it as more of a rebuke to myself and encouragement to others , Where is the encouragement ? Well I hope if you read on , by Gods grace you will see how He can change someone's life for the better . I was born and brought up in a home and by parents who believed in God . I suppose most people brought up on the Island of Lewis can say the same . I grew up always believing that there was a God and that there was a Heaven and hell , and I suppose looking back there was more to Heaven and hell than just the good going to one and the bad going to the other . I was taught that you had to put your faith in Jesus to be saved . For a young boy growing up this was too much to take in . So to cut a long story short , I went through my young life knowing all about God and Jesus , heaven and hell , good and bad , and at that age I new enough , or at least I thought I did .

It has been almost a year since the sad passing of Rafal Kurmanski . We would like to mark the occassion of remembering Rafal , by posting up again , his rider profile from our 2004 web-site . Gone but not forgotten . Rafal Kurmanski was born in Zielona Gora , Poland on 22 August 1982 and his was a much sought-after signature in Britain , having performed so well for his hometown club . Terry Russell finally clinched a deal to bring the youngster to these shores in 2004 , making the upcoming star a full club asset of Swindon Speedway in the process . Kurmanski duly arrived at the expense of the ' doubling-up ' reserves and made his Pebley Beach Robins' debut at Poole on 12 May , when scoring a single point from four starts . The following evening , his first home appearance against the same opponents was quite remarkable inasmuch as after running two lasts , he featured in successive 5-1s with Leigh Adams and Andy Smith to finish with a tally of 5 + 1-points . Prior to joining Swindon , a career highlight was 10-points and sixth place in the World Under-21 Final at Slany , Czech Republic on 7 September 2002 . Then , last season , he was given a wildcard entry into the European Grand Prix , held in Poland at the Slaski Stadium on 17 May . Kurmanski started quietly with a third place finish in heat two , but then facing elimination he held his nerve to win heat six from compatriot Sebastian Ulamek , while both Bjarne Pedersen and Peter Karlsson headed out . That took Kurmanski on to heat twelve , but he was unable to repeat his earlier heroics and a last place behind",2.0

Socialization in also very important in interracial dating and of course the geographical location predestines the set of qualities which one will look in a partner along with the stereotypes concerning this or that race . Geographical location does truly effect how people of different races interact with one another . One of the brightest examples is between the South and the North of the United States of America . A young white woman from the North of the country and a young Afro-American from the South will have a lot of difficulties getting along together , due to the hostility of the South towards white people in general as a race .

I saw you through Newbury on Saturday morning , thought you looked smooth and wished you well . Your time may not appear in the record books but you know what time you did , that should be all that matters . While I agree with a lot of what you have said , are you aware of the incident at Old Windsor wier that caused the race to be called off ? If not I suggest that we all wait for a public airing of the facts before we make too many judgements on what happened . From what I have heard and looking back on the information about the 1998 race when some boats did go over wiers I think DW had no option ( with the EA pressure ) but to call the race off once an incident had happened . I am not part of the DW organisation but as I understand it the race was not called of until 6am - after you had got on the water and started . Perhaps there should have been better co-ordination to advise you of the situation before you started but these things do happen . Let us hope that there is a speedy",2.0

Mediolanum ( Whitchurch ) This is the British Mediolanum of the Antonine Itinerary . Ptolemy places a separate Mediolanum , sometimes identified with Meifod , in central Wales . The town was located on a major Roman routeway between Deva Victrix ( Chester ) and Viroconium Cornoviorum ( Wroxeter ) . The Romans first built a fort which has been tentatively suggested as forming part of the border defences established by Ostorius Scapula around AD 52 . By about AD 100 , however , the army had probably moved on and the surrounding civilian ' vicus ' would have taken over the site . In the mid-2nd century , the area was at least partly covered by timber-framed industrial buildings . The town reached the height of its prosperity by the early 3rd century and there was much rebuilding in stone . This continued for the next hundred years . Masonry houses with associated wooden outhouses were most common during this period . [ 1 ] Roman artefacts from the site are on display in the Whitchurch Heritage Centre . [ 2 ] </doc>",2.0

Thank you so much . It 's really scary to be here among the smartest of the smart . I 'm here to tell you a few tales of passion . There 's a Jewish saying that I love . What is truer than truth ? Answer : The story . I 'm a storyteller . I want to convey something that is truer than truth about our common humanity . All stories interest me , and some haunt me until I end up writing them . Certain themes keep coming up : justice , loyalty , violence , death , political and social issues , freedom . I 'm aware of the mystery around us , so I write about coincidences , premonitions , emotions , dreams , the power of nature , magic . In the last 20 years I have published a few books , but I have lived in anonymity until February of 2006 , when I carried the Olympic flag in the Winter Olympics in Italy . That made me a celebrity . Now people recognize me in Macy's , and my grandchildren think that I 'm cool . ( Laughter ) Allow me to tell you about my four minutes of fame . One of the organizers of the Olympic ceremony , of the opening ceremony , called me and said that I had been selected to be one of the flag-bearers . I replied that surely this was a case of mistaken identity because I 'm as far as you can get from being an athlete . Actually , I was n ' t even sure that I could go around the stadium without a walker . ( Laughter ) I was told that this was no laughing matter . This would be",2.0

The Maghreb's Modern Islamists Moha Ennaji 2012-02-16 FEZ – Just over a year ago , the Arab Spring sparked dramatic change throughout the Arab world . Popular movements have brought a range of avowedly Islamist political parties to power , replacing the largely secular former regimes . What that will mean for these countries , and for the region , is one of today's central geopolitical questions . In North Africa , two Islamist parties have come fully to power via democratic elections : al-Nahda ( Renaissance ) in Tunisia , where the Arab Spring began , and the Justice and Development Party ( PJD ) in Morocco , both of which now lead new coalition governments . Whereas a popular revolution produced regime change in Tunisia , Morocco underwent a peaceful transformation that left the monarchy in place . Last July , Moroccans voted overwhelmingly to approve a new constitution that shifts executive power from the king to the prime minister , who will now be fully responsible for the cabinet , the civil service , and the implementation of government policies . The king retains some prerogatives , such as the authority to select the prime minister ( from the parliament's majority party ) and the head of the army . Furthermore , like heads of state in other parliamentary systems , he has the right to appoint the government ministers and ambassadors , dissolve the parliament , and dismiss the cabinet . While the PJD's success was based on institution-building within a constitutional monarchy , al-Nahda has revolutionized the Tunisian system . But both parties won after running on a moderate platform of constitutionalism , separation of powers , civil liberties , and women's rights . This new political reality in the Maghreb will bring Europe –",2.0

Healthcare reform : What IRS wants you to do first Still sorting out what the new health law means to your company ? Here are two actions you 'll need to take pronto . Those marching orders come straight from IRS , Notice 2010-38 . Finance's two biggest to-dos right now : Expand who your health insurance covers , and Adjust your cafeteria plan to account for that . More people to cover Technically , the health reform law does n't require insurance companies to expand coverage until Sept. 23 , 2010 . But the feds are encouraging insurers to offer early enrollment – and many are . If your carrier is on this list , they 've already expanded coverage : Cigna , Aetna , United , WellPoint , Humana and many of the BlueCross / Blue Shields . More benefits to do it Considering how expensive health coverage is , it 's no wonder cafeteria plans are such a popular benefit . But now that employees can insure their children for longer , they 're going to want to sock away more pre-tax dollars to do it . That 's why effective immediately , employers that offer cafeteria plans must let employees start making pre-tax contributions to the plan to help them pay for the newly-extended coverage . Note : Your company has until the end of the year to amend your cafeteria plan language to reflect the new age limit . Subscribe Today A lot of good it will do to "" sock away "" more money into your FSA . Typical government mentality – force plans to extend coverage to more individuals and then ( starting in 2013 ) slap a ridiculous low limit on how much you can put into an FSA plan ( $",2.0

Carcassonne Farmer Scoring Edited September 12 , 2003 , to take into account information from Usenet thread about the second edition rules . There have been three versions of the farmer scoring in the game Carcassonne . I 've collected the different versions based on postings off Usenet . Note that second and third edition scoring are the same except that in the second edition , a city scores at most once per player , but in the third edition , a city could score multiple times per player . A field is a piece of grassland enclosed by road , city , river or non-existing tiles . First Edition Scoring If a farmer can walk along the field to a city , he is connected to it . It can be fifty tiles away , or on the same tile . As long as unbroken path goes to the city then he gets counted . For each completed city , the player with the most farmers touching it gets four points . Tied players all get four points , each . Note that two-tile cities are two points for a knight when completed . Second Edition Scoring Count the number of farmers in that field . The player with the most pawns inside the field will score for that field . If many players tie for majority of pawns , they all receive the full points . A field will score 3 points for each completed city adjacent to the field . A city is adjacent to the field when part of the city walls are used to define the boundary of the field ( i.e. , next to the field ) . A player can score for a single city one time , and only one time ...",2.0

Local favorite Karen Somerville will be joined by the Blue Night Quintet , five superb young musicians from the Washington DC area for Bojangle Jazz , an evening of jazz , R & B and blues , this Saturday , May 4 , 8 pm at the Garfield Center in Chestertown . This will be the second collaboration between Somerville and the Quintet in Kent County . Their first show , in November of 2012 at the Mainstay in Rock Hall was a resounding success ; so much so that one of the audience members , Larry Wilson , was determined to bring them back for a repeat performance . Somerville has received high praise for her gospel performances with Sombarkin and the New Gospelites , as well as for her performance in Robert Earl Price's play "" The Golden Sardine . "" The Blue Night Quintet ( all still in high school ) consists of Sam Levine , upright bass ; Joseph Deng , tenor sax ; Jordan Wolff , drums ; Austin Yeun , alto sax ; and Jack Gruber , piano . Somerville became acquainted with the pianist , Jack Gruber , via his father , who was producing one of her albums . Gruber said he was interested in working with her , and the rest , as they say , is history . The program is best described as a blend of classic R & B , jazz standards , a hint of country , and the kick of bossa nova . Fans of Smokey Robinson , Etta James and Nina Simone should not miss this show . The Garfield Center for the Arts is pleased to present "" Singing Our Stories , "" a collaboration by vocalist and songwriter Beth McDonald and jazz pianist",2.0

Understanding the Frankenstein Tradition Henry I. Miller 2010-11-03 PALO ALTO – "" It 's alive , it 's moving , it 's alive ... IT 'S ALIVE ! "" So said Dr. Victor Frankenstein when his "" creation "" was complete . Researchers have long been fascinated with trying to create life , but mainly they have had to settle for crafting variations of living organisms via mutation or other techniques of genetic engineering . In May , researchers at the J. Craig Venter Institute , led by Venter himself , synthesized the genome of a bacterium from scratch using chemical building blocks , and inserted it into the cell of a different variety of bacteria . The new genetic information "" rebooted "" its host cell and got it to function , replicate , and take on the characteristics of the "" donor . "" In other words , a sort of synthetic organism had been created . Reactions in the scientific community ranged from "" slight novelty "" to "" looming apocalypse . "" The former is more apt : Venter's creation is evolutionary , not revolutionary . The goal of "" synthetic biology , "" as the field is known , is to move microbiology and cell biology closer to the approach of engineering , so that standardized parts can be mixed , matched , and assembled – just as off-the-shelf chassis , engines , transmissions , and so on can be combined to build a hot-rod . Achieving this goal could offer scientists unprecedented opportunities for innovation , and better enable them to craft bespoke microorganisms and plants that produce pharmaceuticals , clean up toxic wastes , and obtain ( or "" fix "" ) nitrogen from the air ( obviating the need for chemical fertilizers",2.0

Hi , I 've been bisexual for ... at least since I was 11 , although I did n't realise at the time . As time went by I started to realise what I really was . At first I was scared but then I came to realise that it did n't really single me out or make me that much different from everyone else . I came out in 2005 , a day after my birthday ( so my mum could n't shout at me : P ) and at first she could n't look me in the eye but then got used to the idea and now she is fine with it . My closest two friends know as well , one of whom is bi himself , and they are both fine with it too . I 've not made it public because I go to a chav school and will get verbally abused lol .

Division :: Developmental Neurobiology Head of Division :: Dr David Wilkinson Our Division studies how the nervous system develops in the embryos of vertebrates . The brain and spinal cord originate from the neural epithelium , a tissue that forms early in embryo development . The developing nervous system becomes intricately patterned such that different regions of the brain are formed , and different cell types are formed at appropriate positions . The connection of nerves with specific targets within the embryo establishes the foundations of the mature nervous system . Our research studies genes responsible for patterning the neural epithelium and we investigate how their expression results in the formation of different regions and cell types . Since development of neural tissue is very similar across different types of vertebrates , our labs use the distinct experimental advantages of different organisms ( including mice , chicks , frogs and zebrafish ) to gain a better understanding of how the nervous system develops .

Editor Picks is a list series for Britannica editors to provide opinions and commentary on topics of personal interest . With over 4,000 species of parasitic flowering plants in the world , there are a lot of incredible species out there . This list represents my picks as Britannica's plant editor for the five most-impressive parasitic plants . What do you think ? Frans Lanting / Corbis Rafflesia arnoldii , the world's largest individual flower , is kind of nasty . Found in the forests of Malaysia and Indonesia , its giant red-brown blossom is nearly 1 meter ( 3 . 3 feet ) in diameter and weighs up to 11 kg ( 24 pounds ) . It smells like rotting flesh to attract carrion-feeding flies as pollinators and its sticky fruit is spread by rodents . If you 've ever seen a picture of this "" corpse flower , "" you may have noticed its lack of leaves . This delightful organism is actually an obligate parasite and can not photosynthesize on its own . In fact , 100 % of its unpleasantness is fueled with nutrients it steals from the roots of neighboring Tetrastigma vines ! Rafflesia makes parasitism pay off in a big smelly way . On the opposite end of the size spectrum is the minute Pilostyles thurberi , or Thurber's stemsucker . Native to the deserts of southwestern North America , P. thurberi is an obligate parasite on the stems of shrubs in the pea family ( Fabaceae ) . Measuring only about 6 mm ( 0 . 25 inch ) long , the tiny plant lives entirely within the stem tissues of its hosts and lacks roots , leaves , or chlorophyll . Its presence is only made known when it breaks through the",2.0

They are addressed to the latest text of the draft directive ( 5 . 1 . 01 ) though reference is made also to the consultation document published by the Commission in December . On a general level , we recognise the need to develop a supervisory framework for financial conglomerates . It will be important , however , that the proposed legislation should not impose disproportionate regulatory burdens on financial groups doing business in Europe , give rise to unnecessary bureaucracy or generate significant competitive distortions within the EU . PARENT UNDERTAKINGS OUTSIDE THE EUROPEAN UNION It is intended that the geographical scope of the directive should extend beyond the EU to include the parent company of a conglomerate so located . In cases where a third country supervisor does not apply rules equivalent to those in the draft directive , it is proposed that the relevant supervisor in the EU should apply the provisions of the directive to all regulated entities within the group . Another possibility broached in such circumstances is requiring the establishment of a holding company in the EU , facilitating the application of the provisions of the",2.0

Tonya and Marvin Morris were pregnant with their fifth child , Sparrow , when they first learned about cord blood banking . Like many expecting parents who bank , they decided to save her cord blood so it might be available for any of their children , should one of them ever need it . Sparrow Morris was born a healthy baby girl in rural Missouri . When she was 2 years old , she was in the garden playing with her siblings , trying to fill a watering can from the family pool . She lost her balance and tumbled in , quickly becoming unconscious under the water . Tonya began CPR until rescue workers arrived at their rural home and transported the little girl to a place where she could be medevaced to the nearest hospital . The emergency crew did n't receive a pulse until they were in the air . The aftermath After being deprived of oxygen for so long , Sparrow's neurologist had little hope that the toddler would come out of her vegetative state . The family told doctors that they had saved Sparrow's cord blood , but were told that cord blood could only help in the case of blood cancers . Sparrow was sent home , unable to sit up , crawl , or talk . Nearly a year later , Tonya was approached by a friend who was interested in banking with CBR . Tonya called CBR and was put through to a Cord Blood Education Specialist . During the call , she happened to ask the Specialist if cord blood was currently being used to treat brain injury . She was transferred immediately to CBR's transplant office . Offering the chance at a better life Thirteen months after the accident",2.0

How does the news shape the way we see the world ? Here 's the world based on the way it looks -- based on land mass . And here 's how news shapes what Americans see . This map -- ( Applause ) -- this map shows the number of seconds that American network and cable news organizations dedicated to news stories , by country , in February of 2007 -- just one year ago . Now , this was a month when North Korea agreed to dismantle its nuclear facilities . There was massive flooding in Indonesia . And in Paris , the IPCC released its study confirming man's impact on global warming . The U. S. accounted for 79 percent of total news coverage . And when we take out the U. S. and look at the remaining 21 percent , we see a lot of Iraq -- that 's that big green thing there -- and little else . The combined coverage of Russia , China and India , for example , reached just one percent . When we analyzed all the news stories and removed just one story , here 's how the world looked . What was that story ? The death of Anna Nicole Smith . This story eclipsed every country except Iraq , and received 10 times the coverage of the IPCC report . And the cycle continues ; as we all know , Britney has loomed pretty large lately . So why do n't we hear more about the world ? One reason is that news networks have reduced the number of their foreign bureaus by half . Aside from one-person ABC mini-bureaus in Nairobi , New Delhi and Mumbai , there are no network news bureaus in all of Africa",2.0

You can do anything when you hit 18 I was downcast after Doncaster , but my longest run so far -- in a respectable time -- has put a spring in my step ( and an ache in the rest of me ) . In this mood , I could run all the way to London and still get round the marathon course . I 'm pleased to say that this week things have improved . I managed to run 18 miles on Saturday and that was quite comfortable . It 's cheered me up to know that the Doncaster half-marathon last week was such a disaster because I was ill , not because I was unfit . That one long run has given my confidence a boost and I 'm convinced I 'll now survive London . It was n't particularly fast -- three hours 21 minutes to be exact -- but at least I know I can do it . Doncaster put some doubt in my mind but I 've bounced back -- in fact it 's spurred me on . I 'm looking forward to the next few weeks of training and I 'm hoping to speed up a bit . I do n't think I 'll be challenging Paula Radcliffe but hopefully I might break five hours . That 's my goal and now I 'm back to my usual cheery self I 'm determined to do it .

The Roots of Chinese / Japanese Rivalry BOSTON – The anti-Japan protests that continue to roil China are just another indication of the rise of a potent Chinese nationalism . After a century slowly fomenting among Chinese intellectuals , national sentiment has captured and redefined the consciousness of the Chinese people during the last two decades of China's economic boom . This mass national consciousness launched the Chinese colossus into global competition to achieve an international status commensurate with the country's vast capacities and the Chinese people's conception of their country's rightful place in the world . Rapidly , visibly , and inevitably , China has risen . Indeed , our era will likely be remembered as the time when a new global order , with China at the helm , was born . Competitive national consciousness – the consciousness that one 's individual dignity is inseparably tied to the prestige of one's "" people "" – worked its way into the minds of China's best and brightest between 1895 and 1905 . In 1895 , China was defeated by Japan , a tiny aggressor whom the Chinese dismissively called wa ( the dwarf ) . China was already accustomed to rapacious Western powers squabbling over its riches , but had remained self-confident in the knowledge of these powers' irrelevance . However , the assault from Japan , a speck of dust in its own backyard , shattered this self-assurance and was experienced as a shocking and intolerable humiliation . Japan's triumph in 1905 over "" the Great White Power , "" Russia , repaired the damage to China's sense of dignity . From the Chinese point of view , Russia was a formidable European power , one feared by other Western powers . Its defeat , therefore , was",2.0

Direct Auger <font color = purple>recombination</font> causes droop , but its impact can be diminished inserting graded layers into quantum wells to smooth the confining potentials . Calculations by a partnership between at Technion-Israel Institute of Technology and the US Naval Research Laboratory show that a ' softer ' potential reduces Auger recombination , leading to an increase in LED efficiency . The debate over the origin of LED droop has taken yet another twist , with a partnership between researchers at Technion-Israel Institute of Technology and the US Naval Research Laboratory claiming that direct Auger recombination is to blame . This view is at odds with that of many other theorists , who account for droop - the reduction in light efficiency as current is cranked up - with either more complex forms of Auger recombination or models involving defects . For example , Chris Van de Walle's computational science group at the University of California , Santa Barbara , claims that the primary causes of droop are Auger-related processes involving phonons and alloy disorder . And a partnership between researchers at Boston University and Politecnico di Torino , Italy , argue that although Auger-related processes contribute to droop , carrier leakage , compositional fluctuations and threading dislocations may also play significant roles . These differences over the cause of droop stem from differences in the structures under study , according to Roman Vaxenburg from Technion-Israel Institute of Technology . He has his co-workers have looked at quantum well structures , while others have focused on calculations for bulk material . "" In general , in bulk material , Auger recombination is not efficient due to strict energy and momentum conservation requirements , "" explains Vaxenburg .

Committee of Experts on Public Administration First session New York , 22-26 July 2002 Item 4 of the provisional agenda * Basic data on the public sector Basic data on the public sector Report of the Secretariat Contents Introduction The present report represents the continuation of a discussion on collecting and making available internationally comparable data on the public sector , an effort undertaken in collaboration between the Division for Public Economics and Public Administration of the United Nations Secretariat and the former Group of Experts of the United Nations Programme on Public Administration and Finance which got under way during the fourteenth session of the former Group of Experts , in 1998 . Following the recommendations made at that session , the Division elaborated and presented to the former Group of Experts at its fifteenth session a framework for the collection of such data ( see ST / SG / AC . 6 / 2000 / L. 2 ) . That framework described the functions of the State as regulator , tax collector , producer , consumer and provider of cash transfers and subsidies , as well as an employer . It suggested that – taking into consideration the availability of data – the presentation of three kinds of indicators could provide a reasonable picture of the public sector in a given country : expenditure by all levels of government , government employment and the value of tax expenditures . At the same time , although the framework acknowledged the important role of the State as regulator , it suggested that it is extremely difficult to quantify the extent of regulation of economic activity , and concluded that even though regulation is an important function of States , it is virtually impossible to measure in any meaningful way and",2.0

reating a website as a resource for black writers Martin Glynn , poet & playright I feel personally I had a very emotional traumatic journey doing my stuff , in a real sense ; I 'll explain why in a minute . I was very resistant - when I was first asked to look at this I did n't want to get involved . I 'm a storyteller , I 've been in the African <font color = green>oral</font> tradition for 20 years , I 've worked in about 2000 schools , I 've worked extensively in prison . Basically I 've worked with a lot of people that society has forgotten , that 's who I work with . I 've been performing poetry for 20-odd years , I 've travelled around the world with it ... So poetry for me is a way of life . It 's not something I do ; it 's a way of life . My work has been translated for Radio 4 , so I 've worked in radio and I 've used sound as a medium to promote poetry . I also write film & TV scripts ; when you 're writing dialogue for a TV show , you 're writing pure poetry in many respects . So , fortunately for me , I 've engaged with the visual medium . But I have to say that when I came into contact with the possibility of doing something on-line I had a lot of scepticism . On my journal - it took me 5 weeks to actually do anything on-line . If you read my journal ( link ) I was really depressed ; after the first two weeks I wanted to give up . Could n't do it . After an initial period

Supermarket Oct 2005 Project Info Artist Charlotte Thrane's project Supermarket set out to create an environment ( installation ) based on a supermarket with the objects , activities , people , sounds and colours that can be found in such places . By creating backdrops , costumes , masks and props and thinking about poses , characters , lighting and atmosphere , pupils from Halley Primary School were encouraged to share their creative processes and make collective decisions . The project culminated in a double live still film image , projected both at the Chisenhale as part of the installation on the final day , and later at Halley Primary School . </doc>",2.0

This is my first time at TED . Normally , as an advertising man , I actually speak at TED Evil , which is TED's secret sister organization -- the one that pays all the bills . It 's held every two years in Burma . And I particularly remember a really good speech by Kim Jong Il on how to get teens smoking again . ( Laughter ) But , actually , it 's suddenly come to me after years working in the business , that what we create in advertising , which is intangible value -- you might call it perceived value , you might call it badge value , subjective value , intangible value of some kind -- gets rather a bad rap . If you think about it , if you want to live in a world in the future where there are fewer material goods , you basically have two choices . You can either live in a world which is poorer , which people in general do n't like . Or you can live in a world where actually intangible value constitutes a greater part of overall value , that actually intangible value , in many ways is a very , very fine substitute for using up labor or limited resources in the creation of things . Here is one example . This is a train which goes from London to Paris . The question was given to a bunch of engineers , about 15 years ago , "" How do we make the journey to Paris better ? "" And they came up with a very good engineering solution , which was to spend six billion pounds building completely new tracks from London to the coast , and knocking about 40 minutes off",2.0

I 'm going to take you on a journey very quickly .

One of the stars of ABS-CBN tv is the weather man Kuya Kim ( Kim Atienza ) . Kuya Kim Atienza After his talk about the weather he always tells something interesting about nature , animal life , some trivia or something like that . He always says goodbye with the words : Ang buhay ay weather weather lang . I have asked my wife Flor to explain this sentence to me because it was also used when Kuya Kim appeared as co-host in another show . It seems that this sentence has little to do with the weather . Actually it should go like this : Ang buhay ay pana-panahon lang . Panahon = ' it 's time ' ( or ' certain time ' ) , but also means ' weather ' . Panapanahon means more ' it 's time ' in a seasonal way . To make it sound more funny and also looking like it has to do something with the weather Kuya Kim says always : Ang buhay ay weather weather lang which actually means : ' life is changing with the times ' . It means to many Filipinos in the country that life has its ups and downs . And so does the weather . This saying of Kuya Kim seem not to be his own . Some people say it is copied from former president Joseph ' Erap ' Estrada ( saying "" Politics ay weather weather lang "" ) . Others say it was the comedian LEO MARTINEZ who used this phrase the first time in his shows . The phrase Kuya Kim is using demonstrates the difficulty of the Tagalog language .

"" Is Haditha just the tip of the mass grave | Main | Coucil of Europe report on extraordinary rendition out today "" June 04 , 2006 Met chief could face charge over Menezes From The Observer The Crown Prosecution Service is considering legal charges against Britain's most senior police officer over the fatal shooting of Brazilian Jean Charles de Menezes , mistakenly taken to be a terrorist . The Observer can reveal that the Metropolitan Police commissioner , Sir Ian Blair , and two senior commanders in control of the operation that culminated in de Menezes's death are the focus of the final legal analysis of the shooting by Crown prosecutors . If the CPS goes ahead with the dramatic move , the decision would pile further pressure on the already beleaguered head of Scotland Yard . Legal sources close to the CPS case have revealed that , following a four-month review of a report by the Independent Police Complaints Commission , prosecutors are considering whether the command team are ultimately responsible , a decision that could give rise to a charge of gross negligence manslaughter against Blair and two other senior figures . Posted by andrew on June 4 , 2006 11 : 20 AM in the category 7 UK Policy Comments I 'm not convinced this one will actually fly , but it 's interesting to notice how tight-lipped Scotland Yard is being over the latest ' tragic mistake ' in east London .

In a nationally attended teleconference led by Margaret L. Moser , participants in the Editorial Freelancers Association's ( EFA ) New Freelancers ( NFL ) affinity group from as far afield as Florida , California , and Alaska learned about red flags warning them of such roadblocks and how to respond to them from Laurie Lewis , former EFA co-exec , former co-leader of the NFL affinity group and author of What to Charge : Pricing Strategies for Freelancers and Consultants . Although clients have a vested interest in their projects , Lewis cautioned they also may have little understanding of the services provided by editors . Omens of "" trouble down the road "" are often revealed as verbal red flags . Lewis provided a list of these warning signs . 1 . Client says , "" We do n't pay a lot , but we can offer steady work .

Positive and negative aspects of this situation include the following , If you 're looking for "" steady work "" and want to commit to , say , 10 hours a week , this kind of arrangement could be beneficial .

The National Biodiversity Network ( NBN ) is home to all information on the nation's biodiversity . You can find the Local Biodiversity Action Plan ( LBAP ) for your area from www.biodiversityscotland.org or www.searchnbn.net The involvement of the people of Scotland is essential if we are to conserve biodiversity for today and the future . Across Scotland , people are taking action for biodiversity in their own ' back yard ' . Local Biodiversity Action Plan partnerships have been set up , involving government agencies , national and local voluntary bodies and community groups all working together . Local wildlife sites are being managed , greenspace networks established and gardens made more wildlife friendly . Public bodies are looking to include action for biodiversity in their everyday activities . Wherever you live in Scotland , there are opportunities to get involved in biodiversity conservation locally . Twenty-four Local Biodiversity Action Plans ( LBAPs ) cover the country from Shetland in the north to Galloway in the south and from the Western Isles / Na h-Eileanan Siar in the west to Aberdeen in the east . Each LBAP is overseen by a partnership of national and local organisations , some of which also contribute funding to the project . In most cases core funding is provided by SNH and the Local Authority , with a variety of other organisations contributing in different circumstances . One or more LBAP Officers may be employed ( usually by one of the partner organisations - most often the Local Authority ) to promote and co-ordinate activities . In some areas , the additional post is a Community Biodiversity Officer , with a specific remit to encourage community involvement in the LBAP . The work of LBAPs contributes in many ways to fulfilling the objectives",2.0

New figures from the International Air Travel Association ( IATA ) reveal that international passenger numbers are on the rise . International air passenger traffic in the first four months of 2005 was 8.7 per cent higher than the same period in 2004 . Year-on-year figures for April showed a 7.5 per cent increase . There was also a 4.7 per cent year-on-year increase in Cargo traffic during the first four months of the year . However , capacity expansion lagged behind passenger traffic in all regions , averaging 73.6 per cent during the first quarter of this year . IATA director general Giovanni Bisignani warned that despite rising passenger numbers , soaring fuel costs were hitting airlines hard , predicting an industry loss of $ 5 . 5 billion ( ? 3 . 02 billion ) this year . "" However you look at it , 2005 is shaping up to be another difficult year for the airlines , "" he said . "" Fundamental and large-scale change is absolutely critical . "" The IATA is expected to press for further deregulation at its annual meeting in Tokyo next week , criticising governments and airports . Mr Bisignani told a press conference today : "" Airlines moved fast after September 11 , re-engineering , restructuring ... But governments have not played a role . "" </doc>",2.0

As of 2011 approximately 10,900 ESOPs existed , up 12 % from 2007 . Nearly all of these firms have less than 500 workers . Prominent academics have spoken out against ESOPs – Andrew Stumpff , University of Michigan Law states , it 's bad enough to risk your retirement savings in a single company , but it 's even worse if that company is your employer , because your lose your job and your savings . Norman Stein , Drexel University says the ESOP model cause more harm than good . Many of the plans he claims are based on a bloated assessment of the value of the businesses . It 's the linkage to retirement plans that troubles him , not ESOPs as a concept . Research by Harvard , Rutgers and the National Bureau of Economic Research suggest businesses with shared-ownership plans performed better in the recession than more traditionally structured firms . Owners who have taken the plunge claim a series of benefits ; workers are more engaged , better team spirit , driving factor for long term success , values and culture remain intact for a longer period , and it helps employees think like entrepreneurs . Issues To Consider If the CEO is staying on but diluting down her equity stake you need to consider how that might affect the ability to lead . Senior members of the team might feel more empowered to challenge fundamental strategy decisions , creating a business paralyzed by decision making . Depending on the structure of the ESOP be careful that junior employees with family money do n't have a chance to own a significant equity stake . I 've seen this cause massive HR issues .

Mark Wright is an accomplished writer "" currently scraping out a living as a freelance "" contributing to various magazines , writing for Big Finish's range of Doctor Who audio dramas and turning out the odd book along the way ( he 's currently planning to write a guide to the Indiana Jones adventures ) . OTT caught up with Mark as he battled with deadlines to complete his latest book , 1001 DVDs You Should Own , to ask him about his recent publication 24 : Season 2 : The Unofficial Guide , published by Contender Books . OTT : So , how come you did n't write the 24 book for Contender last year ? MARK WRIGHT : I first came to work for Contender when I was commissioned to write the production notes and booklet for the first box set of The Professionals on DVD . Lee Binding , who commissioned me for that work , recommended me to the company's book division when they were keen to do a guide to the first season of 24 . I was asked to write the book , but unfortunately in the time scale they wanted the finished manuscript , I was working on a Doctor Who script whilst still holding down a 9 - 5 job at What DVD , so it just was n ' t possible . This was a real shame , as books was a direction I really wanted to go in . Jim Sangster is a mate , and as he had written some highly successful episode guides himself , I happily recommended him . As it was , I was commissioned to write a guide to CSI : Crime Scene Investigation , so I got to do my book after all (",2.0

N. spatulata has been identified from a single location in the Clarno Formation , the Clarno nut beds , type locality for both the formation and the species . The nut beds are approximately 3 kilometres ( 1 . 9 mi ) east of the unincorporated community of Clarno , Oregon , and considered to be middle Eocene in age , based on averaging zircon fission track radiometric dating which yielded an age of 43.6 and 43.7 ± 10 million years ago and Argon – argon dating radiometric dating which yielded a 36.38 ± 1.31 to 46.8 ± 3.36 mya date . The average of the dates resulted in an age range of 45 to 43 mya . The beds are composed of silica and calcium carbonate cemented tuffaceous sandstones , siltstones , and conglomerates which preserve either a lake delta environment , or alternatively periodic floods and volcanic mudflows preserved with hot spring activity . The species was described from a series of type specimens , the holotype specimen USNM 422378 , which was preserved in the paleobotanical collections of the National Museum of Natural History in Washington , D.C. and four paratype specimens . Two of the paratypes were also in the national Museum collections , while the remaining two were in the University of Florida collections in Gainsville , Florida . The fossils were part of a group of approximately 20,000 specimens collected from 1942 to 1989 by Thomas Bones , Alonzo W. Hancock , R. A. Scott , Steven R. Manchester , and a number of high school students . The N. spatulata specimens were first studied by graduate student R. A. Scott , who placed the species into the extinct genus Palaeonyssa as Palaeonyssa spatulata , with the 1954 type description of the species appearing",2.0

Wolfgang Tillmans From identity politics to borders and nationhood – Dan Udy looks past the Brexit posters in the artist's London show at Maureen Paley Just past the entrance to Maureen Paley , posters bearing the slogans of pro-EU lobby groups spread up the walls . At the end of the corridor ahead , the gallery has opened its backdoor into a courtyard where Wolfgang Tillmans's own prereferendum poster campaign is on display . In blocky typeface occasionally underlaid with photographs , he reminds us to register and vote ; and if we visit the accompanying website , we learn that posters can be ordered as T-shirts or downloaded to print at home . When Tillmans's exhibition opened , just before Britain voted to leave the EU , the gamble , clearly , was on a show that would become a paean to sloganeering . His slick designs would have testified to the power of art as a marketing tool , but instead they 're now a grim reminder of what happens when rightwing populism takes hold . Yet though Brexit casts a gloomy shadow , the posters are only a peripheral element of this wide-ranging show : across the gallery's two floors Tillmans oscillates between a range of photography formats , and deftly moves across size , subject and medium . Downstairs , a giant seascape of the Atlantic Ocean ( The State We 're In , A , 2015 ) sits alongside large-format interior shots of observatories ( not yet titled , 2012 / 2014 ) and a series of smaller photographs documenting airport security controls ( Wako Book 5 / Border Installation , 2016 ) . The latter , featuring pages culled from a limited-edition book of the artist's photographs , signals the continual process of revisitation",2.0

Surrounded by the swirling melodrama of the moment , it 's easy to understand the urge to retweet news or share a particularly impressive picture as soon as possible . In this case , giving in to that urge resulted in well-meaning social media users spreading patently untrue rumors in many cases , causing needless worry and distracting from the serious nature of the real conditions faced by people in the path of the storm . Photo credit : http://ow.ly/eXVuu Much of the false information spread during the height of the storm can be traced back to one devious Twitter user , Shashank Tripath , tweeting as @ comfortablysmug . He sent out a series of dire tweets , some more believable than others , for his own entertainment or for other incomprehensible reasons . He has since apologized , but his misleading "" information "" had spread far and wide before he was unmasked as a Twitter troll . Tripath was the original source of the claim that the NYSE had flooded , among other frequently relayed lies . This reprehensible behavior can be dismissed as the kind of immature and irresponsible prank you hope most people wo n't stoop to even as teenagers , knowing full well that some will . But the episode brings up other more serious issues for the journalists and other social media users who shared it with their many followers . If you hold yourself out as a trusted provider of information – whether you 're a journalist or not – you absolutely have to verify your facts and sources before passing along some juicy tidbit you 've found . That 's hard , especially in an emergency when everyone is hungry for updates . Being one of the first with the news",2.0

Peacebuilding Commission Second session Sierra Leone configuration Progress report on the implementation of the Sierra Leone Peacebuilding Cooperation Framework Contents Introduction The Peacebuilding Commission and the Government of Sierra Leone adopted the Peacebuilding Cooperation Framework ( PBC / 2 / SLE / 1 ) on 12 December 2007 . Six months later , the Framework is widely recognized as one of the principal engagement and partnership tools between the Government of Sierra Leone and the international community . As part of the follow-up to the implementation of the commitments contained in the Framework , and in recognition that the Framework is a "" living document "" , the Government and the Peacebuilding Commission have developed the present progress report . The report takes stock of the progress made and challenges encountered by all stakeholders in the implementation of the Framework and contains recommendations on the required next steps . Trend analysis and risk assessment of peacebuilding Youth employment and empowerment Youth unemployment and marginalization continue to represent a threat to peace consolidation in Sierra Leone . The Government of Sierra Leone , with the support of its international partners , has made a strong commitment to address the situation of youth and has established various institutions , policies and programmes to do so . However , owing to the fragmentation of actors and the proliferation of small projects , such efforts have not generated the desired impact . As a result , the Government has announced plans to create a national youth commission to provide the necessary policy direction and leadership to the many agencies and departments of the Government and the international actors addressing issues of youth . The Government also plans to set up district-level labour centres to invest in the national workforce and to assist in job",2.0

The Harvest Mouse in Cheshire - 1999-2000 Survey Introduction : Harvest Mice ( Micromys minutus Pallas ) , are currently the subject of much debate in Cheshire . Chester Zoo is initiating a breeding programme with a view to re-enforcing populations in the county . Harvest mice weave nests in monocotyledonous herbs that are difficult to find as they are woven from living grass , but become more visible in early winter as the grasses die off ( Harris & Trout 1991 ) . Suitable areas of habitat include cereal fields , rough grassland , reedbed and fen , and the Harvest Mouse can be the most abundant small mammal in wetland ( Perrow & Jowitt 1995 ) . In Britain it is most common in the South and East , but its distribution in North West England is uncertain . The West Midlands and Lancashire yielded three and two records respectively during the Mammal Society survey of the 1970s , while Cheshire , sandwiched between these two regions , had 13 records . The Cheshire records were mostly from the fringes of metres ( Harris 1979 ) . Only one record for Cheshire was found during a re-survey of the 1970s sites , but five of the 13 original sites , including Rostherne Mere ( a National Nature Reserve ) , went unsurveyed . A record of a nest in Cock's Foot grass ( Dactylis glomerata ) growing inside a tree guard in a young plantation was the only other recent record , ( 1997 , Aston ) . To investigate this apparent paucity of records in the last 20 years , a survey of the land covered by the Cheshire Wildlife Trust ( Cheshire , the Wirral , Stockport , Tameside and Trafford ) was planned for 1999",2.0

Odyssey Papers 48 An Iron Cannon Salvaged from the Marquise de Tourny , Western English Channel Nico Brinck Ordnance Specialist , Terschelling , Netherlands The wreck of the Marquise de Tourny was discovered in the western English Channel in 2008 by Odyssey Marine Exploration and subjected to a ferrous metal FADE survey in 2009 . The site is 80m deep and 100km southeast of Plymouth . The presence of 25 iron cannon combined with discovery of the ship's name and date embossed onto its bronze bell , La Marquise de Tourny ' 1744 ' , identified the wreck as the remains of an armed privateer built in Bordeaux and lost during the War of the Austrian Succession . The corsair sank around the mid-18th century . An unknown European organisation is believed to have salvaged the cannon from the wreck . It was subsequently found in a coastal scrap yard and the author of this paper notified . The gun is incised with fleur de lys comparable to those present on a swivel gun recovered from the wreck in 2008 and is identified as deriving from the Marquise de Tourny . At 242cm in length and with a bore diameter of 10 . 5cm , the gun is an 8-pounder of French origin . The cannon's salvage reflects the impossibility of supervizing and protecting historical shipwrecks located outside terriorial waters from non-authorized access , and underlines how essential it is to record and sample at risk underwater cultural heritage of international importance . © Odyssey Marine Exploration , 2015 1 . Introduction The author was recently made aware of an iron cannon salvaged from a wreck believed to be the Marquise de Tourny , a French privateer built in 1744 and lost in the late 1740s or early 1750s in",2.0

A great way to start , I think , with my view of simplicity , is to take a look at TED . Here you are , understanding why we 're here , what 's going on , with no difficulty at all . The best AI in the planet would find it complex and confusing , and my little dog Watson would find it simple and understandable , but would miss the point . ( Laughter ) He would have a great time . And of course , if you 're a speaker here , like Hans Rosling , a speaker finds this complex , tricky . But in Hans Rosling's case , he had a secret weapon yesterday , literally , in his sword swallowing act . And I must say I thought of quite a few objects that I might try to swallow today and finally gave up on -- but he just did it and that was a wonderful thing . So Puck meant not only are we fools in the pejorative sense , but that we 're easily fooled . In fact what Shakespeare was pointing out is we go to the theater in order to be fooled , so we 're actually looking forward to it . We go to magic shows in order to be fooled . And this makes many things fun , but it makes it difficult to actually get any kind of picture on the world we live in , or on ourselves . And our friend , Betty Edwards , the Drawing On the Right Side of the Brain lady , shows these two tables to her drawing class and says , the problem you have with learning to draw is not that you ca n ' t move",2.0

Jury Instruction Corner By Thomas Lundy Duplicity – Part Four Appellate Review of Specific Unanimity Claims This is the fourth installment of Jury Instruction Corner on duplicity and juror unanimity . The first article discussed the constitutional and statutory underpinnings of the doctrine , the second suggested a methodology for determining when a specific unanimity instruction may be necessary , and the third discussed juror unanimity issues in the context of predicate or preliminary facts . This final article will discuss issues related to appellate review of specific unanimity claims . 1 Cognizability and Standard of Review If trial counsel objected and / or made instruction requests that preserved the specific unanimity claim , then there should be no cognizability problem on appeal and typically it will be considered under the abuse of discretion standard . 2 However , even if the claim was not raised below , it may still be cognizable on appeal .

Childhood Memories That Made Me Who I am Today : I was 15 when my father died and after his death I received my result card through the post . I was really happy to see that I passed the exam with excellent marks but I wanted to go to college but it was hard for my brother to send me to college . But I started to teach other children in the village . They really needed help in their studies because their parents could n't read or write they send them to me in evenings after school . So in the morning I 'd go to college and in the evening I teach them and I 'd use the money they gave me to pay my college fees , bus fare and I made my uniform with my own money and I was really happy because I had got everything that I want . I worked hard that 's why I want my son to work hard to carry on with his studies . I was born in the Yemen in 1976 . I lived in a village called Yafa with my Mum and two brothers . My dad lived in England because he was working there and he was sending us some money to live on . I hardly knew my dad because the first time I saw him was when I was 2 years old , which is a time I ca n't remember . When I was about 4 or 5 years old my dad came to visit us and I will never forget that day because he bought me a big doll which I really loved and he bought us lots of things . I was very happy .

Slavery has always been the most shocking phenomena of our world . Slavery , by itself seems very unnatural and provokes mixed feelings from the heart of each person . Some people are descendants of those who used to be slaves years ago . Some faced "" slavery "" even in the contemporary times . And some people just simply do not understand the possibility of one human being considering another human being its slave . Slavery , by definition , is the first historical form of exploitation , under which a slave along with different implements of production becomes the private property of the slave owner . So , in other words slavery converts an individual human being into a "" thing "" or even some kind of consumer item . This phenomena has done a lot of harm to million of people , taking away lives and destroying the fate of the people who could have been happy . What does a contemporary person know about slavery ? The answer will not be very profound . Nevertheless , there is still much to say about it and a lot of thing to recall . It is common knowledge that slavery was eliminated with the end of the Civil War . The South was released from the burden that made the slavery to stop and that started destroying the prejudices concerning the color of skin . Nowadays , it is already history . And could be Americans would not have much information on this important historical issue if it was not for a project Works Projects Administration ( WPA ) , which was introduced by federal government . 2 .

Payday loans no credit checks Payday Loans No Credit Checks – How It 's Possible With payday loans no credit checks are actually necessary , and for a lot of people , this is astounding . Almost every loan needs a credit check – why not these ? If you are one of the many who wonders why you never need a credit check for a pay day loan , this article will teach you the ins and outs of how pay day loans work . • While banks perform credit checks as proof for future payments , it 's the concept that allows the payday loans with no credit checks policy to work . Instead of having proof of your payment , payday loans guarantee their payment through a debit card and a paycheck stub . by under with payday loans no credit checksThe paycheck stub will help lenders decide how much you can borrow , along with when you would need to pay it back . Once they have an idea of your income , they have an idea of how much your maximum payment could be , after all . This eliminates the possibility of over-borrowing . Ideally , payday loans allow the borrowers to automatically debit the payments that you owe , which means that it 's nearly impossible to default on this loan .

When his bed sheets began to hint at something more beneath them , Bruce Bailey blamed his wayward mind . It had played nothing but dirty tricks for months now – since the day Sheila died – yes , since then . So , when he entered his bedroom that Tuesday to catch a nap before his late shift at the factory , he frowned , rubbed his jaw and thought : I made the bed , did n't I ? I always make the bed . He slept fitfully . Nothing strange in that : just another legacy from Sheila's death . As much as he disliked the thought Bruce was growing used to the nightmarish quality of his days ; of the long drawn out shadows that breathed and lurched drunkenly around his room . The light fixture had begun to resemble a blind milky eye , as if age itself worked upon it . Sometimes he wished it would simply blow . It offered little comfort anyway ; its glow had grown sickly . Bruce imagined jaundiced skin clinging to it , tainting the light as it passed through . It was these thoughts that occupied the greater part of Bruce's mind , and when they were n't there , Sheila's face would take up residence , wounded , half pleading waiting to come in from the cold . Unable to sleep , he staggered out of bed , stood for a moment trying to recollect what he was supposed to do next . He 'd slept in his work clothes again , something Mr Shueman had remarked upon the day before . His sympathy had long died along with his patience towards Bruce's shattered attention .

Everything you need to upgrade your trike with the new Nuvinvi N360 CVP Hub . This kit features the Nuvinci CVP Hub , custom 20-inch or 26-inch wheel , spokes , nipples , Schwalbe liner , shifter , and cables . Why the NuVinci hub ? The NuVinci continuously variable planetary ( CVP ) is the first viable CVT drivetrain for trikes and a revolutionary , new alternative to conventional derailleur and fixed-gear internal hubs delivering a totally unique riding experience . The ride is incredibly smooth , allowing the rider to shift "" gears "" while pedaling , coasting , or at a standstill . Its elegant , simple design delivers all the advantages of planetary gear sets without the limitation of fixed speed ratios , without wide gaps between gears , and without jolts or jerks to the rider's legs and lower back . Compared to the original NuVinci trike drivetrain , the N360 model is over 30 % lighter , 17 % smaller and has an increased ratio range . Shift effort is significantly reduced even under high pedal forces and there is 50 % less twist rotation required to move between the lowest and highest ratios . In addition , for better protection , the hub interface is now housed inboard of the frame drop-out . With an infinite number of ratios available within its nominal 360 % ratio range , the N360 drivetrain is an attractive replacement for derailleurs and internally geared hubs as it provides a ride and shifting experience unlike any other . The NuVinci CVP enables riders to maintain an optimum cadence regardless of terrain and makes shifting as easy as adjusting the volume on a radio Ideal for cruiser and commuter riding styles , the NuVinci CVP offers a smooth adjusting",2.0

The 10X Extreme is a rather sharp looking cooler . Overall it does n't look or feel like it 's been fabricated from a tin can . Many CPU coolers have made the mistake of using low quality , thinner aluminum for their fins . It 's unlike many of the performance tower coolers in that it comes assembled with a mounted 120mm blue LED cooling fan of Zalman's choice . Many enthusiasts like to use fans of their own choice . However , if the 120mm fan used here is of decent quality , we see no reason why it will ever be an issue even amongst DIY enthusiasts . Overall , the 10X Extreme rather solid cooler . It 's roughly 5 inches wide by 6.25 inches tall x 4 inches deep . Most of that size comes from the fan frame which is actually more of a "" cap "" of sorts sitting on top with two small screws holding the fan in place . Basically , just for show but does add a nice finished quality to the product . Mentioned earlier , the cooler contains a controller known as the PWM Mate . The unique thing about the PWM Mate is that it can be disconnected from the cooler and act as a wired remote when coupled with the included extension cable . Users can allow the Mate to hang or mount on the back of their computer case for easier control . It saves you time from having to open and close the chassis . The entire cooler is made from or covered in what Zalman has dubbed "" Black Pearl "" Nickel Plating . We counted 5 full length U-shaped heat pipes running the full length and most the width of the cooler",2.0

News Item : 3 February , 2003 Citizenship to stay at Key Stage 4 Citizenship remains a statutory subject at Key Stage Four under the government 's recently published outline strategy for 14-19 education . The Citizenship Foundation welcomes Citizenship's inclusion alongside Maths , English , Science , Religious Education and PE in a slimmed down National Curriculum . The essential theme of the proposals is to establish a new coherence and more flexibility from 14 , an approach we hope will see statutory Citizenship provision extended to 19 . New compulsory ' work-related learning ' programmes for all will also be introduced as part of the proposed changes . The Citizenship Foundation's First Friday seminar on 7 February , hosted by the TUC , will focus on the links between work-related learning and citizenship , with speakers from Middlesex University , the Nuffield Foundation , Ealing LEA and Lambeth Education-Business Partnership . </doc>",2.0

They flee here for safety but are sent back to face death Zimbabwe's democrats live in fear of beatings and murder . But if they seek asylum in Britain , they risk being bundled onto the first flight to Harare - where Mugabe's agents lie in wait . Paul Harris and Martin Bright Sunday January 13 , 2002 The Observer They were waiting for him at the airport , just as he feared . Gerald Muketiwa was still recovering from the eight-hour flight to Harare when British immigration officers handed him over to their Zimbabwean counterparts . But the airport officials were not what they seemed . They were members of Zimbabwe's feared Central Intelligence Organisation . Muketiwa was a youth organiser for the opposition Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) and had tried to claim asylum in Britain . Instead of offering sanctuary , Britain deported him . The Zimbabwean secret police had been monitoring his progress and now was their chance . As he was whisked off for interrogation , one of the CIO men leaned over and told Muketiwa with a smile : ' We 've been looking for you , Mr Muketiwa . You have sold out our country and you are going to prison for a long time . What have you been saying in the UK ? ' Muketiwa's tale , recounting last week from a secret location in South Africa , sounds extraordinary , but an Observer investigation has discovered that scores of members of opposition parties in Zimbabwe face being sent back to President Mugabe's regime with little regard for their safety . Some already have been . Most of them justifiably say they face imprisonment , torture or death upon their return . The CIO monitors every flight to Harare",2.0

CHAPTER V. Advice from a Caterpillar The Caterpillar and Alice looked at each other for some time in silence : at last the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth , and addressed her in a languid , sleepy voice . ' Who are YOU ? ' said the Caterpillar . This was not an encouraging opening for a conversation . Alice replied , rather shyly , ' I--I hardly know , sir , just at present--at least I know who I WAS when I got up this morning , but I think I must have been changed several times since then . ' ' What do you mean by that ? ' said the Caterpillar sternly . ' Explain yourself ! ' ' I ca n ' t explain MYSELF , I 'm afraid , sir ' said Alice , ' because I 'm not myself , you see . ' ' I do n't see , ' said the Caterpillar . ' I 'm afraid I ca n ' t put it more clearly , ' Alice replied very politely , ' for I ca n ' t understand it myself to begin with ; and being so many different sizes in a day is very confusing . ' ' It is n't , ' said the Caterpillar . ' Well , perhaps you have n ' t found it so yet , ' said Alice ; ' but when you have to turn into a chrysalis--you will some day , you know--and then after that into a butterfly , I should think you 'll feel it a little queer , wo n ' t you ?

Saunders excels at recreating that maelstrom of conflicting emotions , speaking in the authentic tone of a defiant but confused young man . Pulp Boy is wonderfully written , poignant and quirky .

Female circumcision is also known , more accurately , as female genital mutilation and female genital cutting ( FGC . ) There are three forms of FGC . The first is a clitoridectomy , the cutting and / or removal of the hood of the clitoris and all or part of the clitoris . The second is an excision which removes the clitoris , the hood , and the labia minor ( the inner folds of the vulva that is responsible for producing lubrication . ) The infibulation is the third and most radical which also removes everything in the excision along with the labia majora , the outer folds of the vulva . Once removed the sides of the vulva are sewn together leaving a small hole ( about pencil size ) for the flow of menstruation and urine . The tradition of FGC dates back more than 1000 years and is practiced in parts of Asia , the Far East , Europe , Asia , South America , and even amongst certain ethnic groups in the United States . Aisha Abdel Majid tells of her experience in an interview with Rogaia Mustafa Abusharaf , an anthropologist born in Sudan , in her article "" Unmasking the Tradition of Female Circumcision . "" Majid describes her cutting is when she was only 6 years old . She recalls being taken by her mother and two aunts to the midwife in the neighborhood known for performing circumcisions . She is told that she is going to be purified . Upon this realization Aisha tries to break free but is forced down and ordered onto a bed of ropes with a hole in the middle .

My journey to coming here today started in 1974 . That 's me with the funny gloves . I was 17 and going on a peace walk . What I did n't know though , was most of those people , standing there with me , were Moonies . ( Laughter ) And within a week I had come to believe that the second coming of Christ had occurred , that it was Sun Myung Moon , and that I had been specially chosen and prepared by God to be his disciple . Now as cool as that sounds , my family was not that thrilled with this . ( Laughter ) And they tried everything they could to get me out of there . There was an underground railroad of sorts that was going on during those years . Maybe some of you remember it . They were called deprogrammers . And after about five long years my family had me deprogrammed . And I then became a deprogrammer . I started going out on cases . And after about five years of doing [ deprogramming ] I was arrested for kidnapping . Most of the cases I went out on were called involuntary . What happened was that the family had to get their loved ones some safe place somehow . And so they took them to some safe place . And we would come in and talk to them , usually for about a week . And so after [ the arrest ] happened I decided it was a good time to turn my back on this work . And about 20 years went by . There was a burning question though that would not leave me .

Education Secretary Alan Johnson is also giving headteachers and school staff new powers to search pupils for weapons as part of his policy to ensure schools are "" knife and weapon free "" zones and safe and secure places to learn . Staff will be able to use blanket non-contact or minimal contact screening for weapons without needing consent or grounds of suspicion to do so . Random checks could be used to catch offenders unawares . If screening arouses suspicion that a pupil is carrying a weapon , school staff will then be able to use the new powers in the Violent Crime Reduction Bill to carry out a hands-on search . Screening involves pupils walking through a "" bleeping "" arch or being checked with a metal detector wand . Heads will still be able to call in the police if they need to in order to deal with incidents . </doc>",2.0

Beware toxic chemicals in imported clothing CHOICE says Australia lags behind overseas regulation CHOICE says that inadequate chemical regulation for imported textiles , clothing and footwear means that consumers are unaware that they could be wearing toxic chemicals . In a report into chemicals in textiles , clothing and footwear ( TCF ) , the people's watchdog says Australian chemical regulation lags behind other countries . As a result , Australians are exposed to higher risks of allergic reactions to chemicals in new clothes , footwear and even furniture . "" Over ninety percent of the clothes on Australian shelves are imported . The trend for ' fast fashion ' also means that retailers are under pressure to put more stock on shelves , more often , "" says CHOICE spokesperson , Ingrid Just . "" That pressure , combined with our inadequate chemical regulation for apparel , means that consumers have less protection than people in other countries where regulation is stronger . "" The European Union's ' EU Reach ' legislation regulates the use of more than 300 thousand harmful substances used in textile , clothing and footwear . EU Reach also sets maximum chemical limits for TCF products that come into contact with human skin . The situation in Europe contrasts with that in Australia , where 50 thousand substances are overseen by the National Industrial Chemicals Notification and Assessment Scheme ( NICNAS ) – the Australian equivalent of EU Reach . Additionally , in Australia , there are no legally prescribed limits for the use of those substances in textiles . The CHOICE report cites the case of a woman who suffered chemical burns from new ballet style shoes when they were wet from rain . Subsequent tests by Monash University showed that the shoes were",2.0

Eco-Friendly Wedding Favors If you are determined to have an eco-friendly wedding , there are multiple ways you re your wedding can be green from start to finish . You can even choose to send your guests home with wedding favors that help them to continue eco-friendly behavior well after your wedding is over . Below are some things to look for in an eco-friendly wedding favor , invitation and other wedding accessories . If you are an eco-friendly persona , you probably already know that you should not have your guests throw rice at your wedding because it is not healthy for the birds . Confetti is not much better because it has harmful dyes that can be detrimental to the environment . Wildflower seeds may seem like a good idea on the surface , but may not be appreciated by neighbors or the venue at which your ceremony is held . </doc>",2.0

Mass media liberal bias "" Freedom of the press is guaranteed only to those who own one . "" A.J. Liebling "" Liberal "" comes from the words liberty . What is liberty for mass media ? Mass media holds liberty as its primary value . The designation of mass media is to deliver an enormous amount of different message to a very large audience . It is supposed to play the role of the mediator between the events happening in the worlds around and the viewer in order to make the viewer's opinion over the issue objective and suspended . Mass media claims to provide a diversity of different thoughts including political , religious , economic and other ones without thrusting the opinion of the audience . Do journalists , news producers and all the mass media representatives choose themselves the event they will report and the material they will cover ? The reality says that the "" liberal bias "" of the mass media is nothing more than a myth . The nation sees and hears only what the mass media owners want it to perceive . The major mass media companies do a great providing almost all mainstream broadcasts and almost a half of the main newspaper publications . Mass media "" nominally "" does have liberal bias but in reality it is an illusion to make the audience feel safe while watching TV , reading newspapers and listening to the radio . The owners of the mass media companies have their own motives to cover the news in a specific way or from the side they are interested in . The liberalism ends at the point when it comes to the need of the company's owner to impose his will on the audience . </doc>",2.0

Disarmament Diplomacy Issue No. 33 , December 1998 - January 1999 Nuclear Zealotry : In Search of Justification By Jozef Goldblat Ever since the signing of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty ( NPT ) , by which the parties committed themselves to negotiate nuclear disarmament , the nuclear-weapon States have repeatedly assured world public opinion that they intend to fulfil this commitment and eventually eliminate nuclear weapons from their arsenals . However , these assurances lack credibility because the strategic doctrines of the great powers remain unchanged . In spite of the disappearance of the East-West nuclear confrontation and the general improvement in the international situation , the employment of nuclear weapons is still envisaged by the great powers as a way to react to any attacks on them or their allies at any point of the globe . The nuclear zealots , who have turned their nuclear doctrine into an article of faith and protect it religiously against the criticism of doubting Thomases , assert that what they have in mind is not nuclear-fighting but nuclear deterrence . But what do they want to deter with nuclear weapons ? Certainly not aggression by States having at their disposal only conventional means of warfare . For the conventional forces of the nuclear powers are quantitatively and / or qualitatively superior to the forces of any of their potential non-nuclear-weapon adversaries . They can , therefore , stop armed attacks by the latter without recourse to nuclear weaponry . In any event , using nuclear arms in response to the use of conventional arms would grossly defy the principle of proportionality enshrined in the humanitarian law of armed conflict . But we are told that the threat of use of nuclear weapons is indispensable to deter attacks with biological or chemical weapons",2.0

The Hardest Part About Change is Taking Action BY KATHRYN MOTT I honestly do n't think that anyone out there really strives for mediocrity in every facet of their lives . There are some people that are content with their situation in life , but everyone has something they want to excel in ; something they want to be proud of . Unfortunately , most people do n't have the drive to do something about it . They waste away their time and talents day dreaming of what could be instead of living the life they want . People are constantly taking the easy road in life : it 's less risky , it does n't involve a lot of effort and it 's comfortable . Change requires you to step out of your comfort zone and into the unknown . You have to change yourself , your surroundings even your habits . Everyone has those moments in life where you look at where you are and the things you 've done to get there ; as a result , you 'll either be proud or disappointed . For those of you who have reached the point where you are wondering , "" how did I get here ? "" , there is still hope . Change is difficult . If it were easy , we would all be famous billionaires living in mansions . The fact that it 's hard is what makes change and improvement so great . Improving your life will result in several positive outcomes such as , giving you a better sense of self , making you a better person , mother father , friend , etc. and you 'll find yourself being happier in general .

We see with the eyes . But we see with the brain as well . And seeing with the brain is often called imagination . And we are familiar with the landscapes of our own imagination , our inscapes . We 've lived with them all our lives . But there are also hallucinations as well . And hallucinations are completely different . They do n't seem to be of our creation . They do n't seem to be under our control . They seem to come from the outside , and [ seem ] to mimic perception . So I am going to be talking about hallucinations . And a particular sort of visual hallucination which I see among my patients . A few months ago I got a phone call from a nursing home where I work . They told me that one of the residents , an old lady in her 90s , was seeing things . And they wondered if she 'd gone bonkers . Or , because she was an old lady , whether she 'd had a stroke , or whether she had Alzheimer's . And so they asked me if I would come and see Rosalie , the old lady . I went in to see her . It was evident straight away that she was perfectly sane and lucid and of good intelligence . But she 'd been very startled , and very bewildered because she 'd been seeing things . And she told me -- the nurses had n ' t mentioned this -- that she was blind , that she had been completely blind , from macular degeneration , for five years .

Part 2 Chapter 4 WHEN Maheu came in after having left Étienne at Rasseneur's , he found Catherine , Zacharie , and Jeanlin seated at the table finishing their soup . On returning from the pit they were always so hungry that they ate in their damp clothes , without even cleaning themselves ; and no one was waited for , the table was laid from morning to night ; there was always someone there swallowing his portion , according to the chances of work . As he entered the door Maheu saw the provisions . He said nothing , but his uneasy face lighted up . All the morning the emptiness of the cupboard , the thought of the house without coffee and without butter , had been troubling him ; the recollection came to him painfully while he was hammering at the seam , stifled at the bottom of the cutting . What would his wife do , and what would become of them if she were to return with empty hands ? And now , here was everything ! She would tell him about it later on . He laughed with satisfaction . Catherine and Jeanlin had risen , and were taking their coffee standing ; while Zacharie , not filled with the soup , cut himself a large slice of bread and covered it with butter . Although he saw the brawn on a plate he did not touch it , for meat was for the father , when there was only enough for one . All of them had washed down their soup with a big bumper of fresh water , the good , clear drink of the fortnight's end . "" I have no beer , "" said Maheude , when the father had",2.0

Contents A painter leaves the town and walks around countryside . While he is resting on the grass , humming the melody of Speak Softly Love , a large spaceship lands near him . An alien exits the spaceship , photographs the environment and tries to contact the painter by changing his appearance to resemble nearby animals and objects and by touching him . The painter is frightened and tries to run away , but becomes tired , falls from a cliff and lies on the ground , imagining that the alien is going to lock him in a cage and torture him . The alien approaches the painter and tries to hum the same melody that the painter hummed earlier , but makes some mistakes . The painter understands that the alien is friendly , teaches him the correct melody , and they walk away together hand in hand . The film has no dialogue in any language . All communication is made using music , gestures and gazes ; the alien also tries to communicate by shapeshifting . Director Vladimir Tarasov explored this theme of universal communication in his other films ; he considered animation "" the Esperanto of all mankind "" . [ 1 ] Even though The Godfather films were not distributed in the Soviet Union , [ citation needed ] the theme music was familiar to Soviet people thanks to this short film .

DFES supports the Western Australia Police as a combat authority for urban search and rescue ( USAR ) . The agency has a developed the capability to deal with the rescue of casualties trapped by buildings , landfall or slippage which collapse as a result of industrial accidents , explosions , natural disasters and terrorist activity . Additional funding in recent years has allowed significant advances to be made in the Western Australia's preparedness , response and recovery capabilities for USAR . Category 2 , which qualifies the responder as a technician with the competencies to conduct underground searches , and ; Category 3 , which qualifies the responder to lead a USAR taskforce . To date , all career firefighters are trained to Category 1 ( CAT 1 ) and there are several Category 2 ( CAT 2 ) technicians available to respond to incidents requiring the specialised skills of the USAR Task Force . Western Australia now has a qualified USAR Canine Team to enhance our operational capacity and is the only State with an integrated canine team in its USAR Task Force . It is recognised around the world that canine teams are an essential element in the efficient and speedy location of victims trapped as a result of building collapse or earthquake . We have been working over the past two years to train a team of dogs that meet nationally and internationally recognised standards . The USAR team has adopted the New Zealand standard for USAR Canine Teams . It currently has five dogs in training with the aim of having four qualified dogs in the USAR task force in 2008-09 . A New Zealand dog trainer and assessor were brought to Perth to provide training and assessment of local State Emergency Service dogs ,",2.0

Personnel matters Report by the Director-General Contents Developments on personnel-related matters The Organization continued to strengthen its field presence by increasing the number of Professional staff ( international and local ) in the field . As of 1 September 2008 there were 56 Professional staff in the field ( 39 international and 17 national ) , which constitutes a 43 per cent increase since the field mobility policy was launched in April 2006 . The modalities of implementation of the Young Professionals Programme ( YPP ) were finalized and a policy document was issued containing provisions for the recruitment and career management of those to be recruited under this programme . The programme aims at facilitating succession planning , knowledge retention and rejuvenating the workforce through the recruitment , on a competitive basis , of young talent into the Organization . The programme targets individuals under the age of 30 who will be recruited for a three-year fixed term appointment at the P-1 level . Once recruited they will follow a managed development programme , including the possibility of a field assignment . The YPP includes ten positions in the Programme Development and Technical Cooperation ( PTC ) and the Programme Coordination and Field Operations ( PCF ) Divisions . A revised learning policy has been presented for staff / management consultations to the Joint Advisory Committee ( JAC ) . The policy recognizes the fact that UNIDO's most important resource is its staff and the knowledge and technical expertise embodied in them . It takes into consideration the challenging and dynamic business environment , in which UNIDO is operating as well as the need for the Organization to be a learning organization . The policy also introduces some measures to encourage continuous flow of knowledge and ideas between the",2.0

Space Station Science Golden Kite Award Winner Space Station Science was my first book , and remains my most popular . It won the SCBWI Golden Kite Award for best nonfiction book of 1999 and has sold about 50,000 copies . Excerpts ( especially of the explanation for why things are weightless in space ) have appeared in tests and textbooks . The book has been translated into Arabic and Korean ( copies available--see Book Orders ) . The first edition ( hardback ) was published by Scholastic and is now out-of-print . The second edition ( paperback ) has been available from Windward since 2004 . The International Space Station assembly is finally done . Learn all about the systems and challenges of doing science in our laboratory in space ! Order autographed copies using this Mail Order Form or send email to make arrangements for local ( Houston ) orders . Read an Extra Chapter ! Like most nonfiction authors , I had way more information about space stations than I could fit in one book . To fit the 128-page format , I had to sacrifice the "" History of Space Stations "" chapter . Then I realized that though it would n't fit in the book , there was plenty of room for it on my website ! Plus I can include hot links to photos and other information I could not put in the book . Have fun reading Space Station History ! Space Writing Activity The Mission Control chapter of Space Station Science is written in a "" complete-your-own-adventure "" format . Individuals and classes can use this chapter as a springboard to create a science fiction story . Directions and the Mission Control chapter are available on the The Right Spin on Things",2.0

Based in Little Rock , AR , Heifer is a global organization dedicated to ending world hunger and poverty . The organization promotes sustainability to do this : Heifer provides cows , goats , and other livestock to families in need around the globe . But before receiving an animal , recipients are trained in animal care and environmentally sound agricultural practices . The goal ? For families to lift themselves out of povertynot rely on others to do soand , in the process , become self-reliant . When it came time for Heifer to build new company headquarters in Little Rock , the organization had the chance to follow its own teachings . It 's no surprise , then , that organization officials demanded that the headquarters , which cost $ 17 . 5 million to build , have as little impact on the surrounding land as possible . The new headquarters meet this demand with a cutting-edge green building , one designed to conserve energy and curb pollution . The hope , Heifer officials say , is that the building 's environmentally friendly features , including a wetland built out of a former decaying brownfield , and a graywater storage tower that provides for a majority of the headquarters' water needs , serve as a model for other institutions who want to "" make living in harmony with the earth part of their mission . "" The building's innovative rainfall collection system and onsite water treatment methods , provide a major boost to the facility's green status . Relying on the newly constructed wetland and a 25 , 000-gallon water tower , the headquarters also serve as a model for other property owners investigating the feasibility of environmentally friendly onsite treatment , collection , and reuse of water",2.0

TV Licensing : A Picture Paints A Thousand Words Jimmy Savile committed vile sexual abuse of children when he was on the payroll and property of the BBC . That much is completely beyond dispute . BBC employees , who knew all about Savile's crimes , turned a blind eye as he molested some of Britain's most vulnerable children in his BBC Television Centre dressing room . Today the BBC's Director General , George Entwistle , who described Savile as a "" skillful and successful sexual predator "" , admitted that the Corporation was currently investigating up to 10 serious allegations involving past and present employees over the "" Savile period "" . A subsequent BBC statement clarified that the Corporation was "" aware of nine allegations of sexual harassment , assault or inappropriate conduct regarding current staff or contributors "" . There has never been a better time to demonstrate your disgust for the BBC by cancelling your TV licence . Anyone cancelling their TV licence does not need to give TV Licensing a reason , although they like to pretend otherwise . People are under no legal obligation to communicate or cooperate with TV Licensing and should ignore their correspondence completely . Savile's abuse is the tip of the iceberg as far as BBC corruption and criminality is concerned . I "" opted out "" of the TV licence two years ago . It 's easy : just cancel your direct debit , like I did , and then ignore them . I 'd rather donate the £ 150 I save each year to charity . Most quality TV is available on catch-up anyway - why pay for something that 's free ? - and it 's cheap to buy second-hand DVD box-sets of your favourite shows on",2.0

France's Fourth Moment KYIV – Since World War II's end , France has consistently risen to the challenge of restructuring Europe in times of crisis . In doing so , France became the catalyst not only for building European unity , but also for creating the prosperity that marked Europe's post-war decades – a prosperity now under threat because of the global financial and economic crisis . If we are to see a stronger Europe emerge from today's challenges , visionary French leadership is needed again . The first moment when decisive French leadership began to unify Europe came when Robert Schuman and Konrad Adenauer created the European Coal and Steel Community . By rooting the then West Germany in the political , economic , and social fabric of the West , that step heralded the start of Germany's rebirth and economic miracle . The second time that France consolidated Europe's internal architecture came in 1983 , during the debates over the stationing of American cruise and Pershing missiles in Germany to counter the deployment of SS20 missiles by the Soviet Union . France's resolve to stand with Germany helped prevent Germany from drifting into a dangerous neutrality that would have shaken the European community to its core . The third moment came after the Berlin Wall fell , and it was feared that an enlarged Germany might destabilize Europe . After initially trying to delay reunification , France embraced it , in exchange for Germany 's reaffirming its commitment to European unity and Franco-German leadership of the European community . As a result , Germany bound itself to the idea of "" ever closer union "" even more definitively by pledging to join the common European currency , the euro . It is now urgent that the insights that",2.0

John Joubert's <font color = orange>Jane</font> Eyre is hauntingly intimate – <font color = orange>review</font> C hristmas is coming , and choirs are getting ready to sing such perennially popular carols as Torches ! and There is no rose . Their composer , John Joubert , is meanwhile anticipating his 90th birthday in the spring , and the occasion will be marked by the release ( on Somm Recordings ) of his opera Jane Eyre . Recorded live at this world premiere concert performance by the English Symphony Orchestra in Birmingham , it is proof again of Joubert's distinctive voice , and a reminder that there is much more to his music than those deservedly well-loved carols . Domiciled in Britain since 1946 , the Cape Town-born Joubert has played a significant role in this country's musical life , yet the extent and originality of his output are sometimes overlooked . Composing in almost every genre , he has a work-list ( currently nudging towards Op. 200 ) embracing chamber music , two symphonies , four concertos and eight operas , the latter reflecting his strong literary instincts and including adaptations of George Eliot's Silas Marner and Joseph Conrad's Under Western Eyes . Completed nearly 20 years ago , his Charlotte Brontë opera has undergone revision and tightening to emerge in the two-act form heard here . Kenneth Birkin's libretto distills the emotional essence of the novel – rather than its epic sweep and detail – taking a selective "" scenes from "" approach . It works hauntingly well , although amid a series of mostly intimate duets , the sudden ballooning of the cast in the wedding scene not only feels like something out of a different work but might prove an obstacle to opera houses looking to stage the piece .

Sound modelling is an important part of the analysis-synthesis process since it combines sound processing and algorithmic synthesis within the same formalism . Its aim is to make sound simulators by synthesis methods based on signal models or physical models , the parameters of which are directly extracted from the analysis of natural sounds . In this article the successive steps for making such systems are described . These are numerical synthesis and sound generation methods , analysis of natural sounds , particularly time-frequency and time-scale ( wavelet ) representations , extraction of pertinent parameters , and the determination of the correspondence between these parameters and those corresponding to the synthesis models . Additive synthesis , nonlinear synthesis , and waveguide synthesis are discussed . </doc>",3.0

Daniella , 5 , jumped off her brother's bunk bed Â and broke her elbow . Daniella's parents took her to their local emergency room . When the doctors removed her cast eight weeks later , her parents quickly realized that her arm may not have set properly . To help their daughter , the family found the Pediatric Orthopedic Surgery Service at Hospital for Special Surgery on the Upper East Side . Since then , Daniella's elbow has been re-set and , with physical therapy cast removal , she is healing well . Daniella's parents' experience is n't necessarily uncommon . The numbers of orthopedic residents choosing pediatrics as a subspecialty is not keeping up with demand in some areas . And advances in medicine have made it difficult for general orthopedists to stay abreast of the best treatments for children in the same way that a sub-specialist can . How can parents help prevent pediatric fractures ? Proper supervision can help reduce falls that often contribute to fractures . Also , always make sure your child is wearing appropriate protective gear , like wrist guards during activities like rollerblading , and helmets while skateboarding , bicycle riding and other outdoor activities . Beware that fatigue and weakness can lead to a stumble or fall that can result in a fracture . Refusal to use or bear weight on a limb : Kids will tell you that they 're in pain . But , in a child who is not old enough to identify where he hurts , refusal to bear weight on a leg or use a limb could indicate a fracture . In some cases of a leg or lower extremity fracture , the child may be able to walk , but may do so with a",3.0

4Children's Response to Government Review of Policy on Children and Young People Commenting on the Government's recently announced Policy Review of Children and Young People ( 5 July 2006 ) , Anne Longfield , Chief Executive of the national children's organisation 4Children , said : "" 4Children believes there are 5 key issues the review should focus on at this crucial stage in the reform and delivery of children's services : · Support and intervention is needed to move towards a preventative approach rather than crisis intervention . This is central to the Childcare Act but would be very difficult to achieve without additional resources . 4Children believes a new Transformation Fund is necessary in order to achieve this . · It is necessary to reach out to those who need support most and to integrate targeted support within broader children's services . · There is a need to ensure the delivery and ongoing sustainability of childcare , Children's Centres and extended schools . 4Children believes that spending in this area needs to double to ensure effective delivery of the vision . · It is necessary to rethink and better integrate the support and services provided to young people and more effectively nurture and support local community initiatives . · There is a need to devise new and creative ways of involving and engaging children in the world they inhabit and in which they are able to make a positive and valuable contribution . We are at a crucial stage in the reform of children's services with major new approaches coming into place . The review must build upon existing developments , refine and further these changes and provide the financial underpinning and stability needed to deliver real change for children . "" </doc>",3.0

The Unlimited All-Stars was originally created in 1990 to preserve the then dwindling open classes on the dirt tracks in Western Pennsylvania . For quite a while , the Unlimited All-Stars concept was only applied there . In 2001 the concept was tested on tracks in Florida . As a result of success there it later spread to Arizona , Georgia and the Carolinas . It has continued to grow , and as of the beginning of the 2012 season , there are at least 21 officially recognized circuits across the country , and more are sure to come . To read the complete history of the Unlimited All-Stars concept click on "" History "" in the directory above . The Unlimited All-Stars ( UAS ) is a national club that represents a single class or division for kart racing that combines a wide variety of engine types . Those engines are limited only by their maximum displacement ; otherwise there are virtually no limits to permissible modifications . The class was developed primarily for competition on short dirt oval tracks although the rules have been applied successfully on other tracks as well . Obviously , karts such as these are capable of a very high level of performance and therefore the class is intended only for experienced drivers who have proven themselves capable of safely competing in a sportsman like manner . Due to its nature , the Unlimited All-Stars is not a class that everyone will want to participate in ; it 's definitely not intended for everyone . Racers who are eager to try new and sometimes radical technical ideas feel right at home in the UAS . The rules contain a set of parameters , and emphasize safety but were intentionally written to allow and encourage",3.0

We look around the media , as we see on the news from Iraq , Afghanistan , Sierra Leone , and the conflict seems incomprehensible to us .

What To Expect When You Enter Marriage Counselling There are many relationship counselling London professionals offering to provide marriage improvement consultation services . As a couple , when you enter into marriage counselling , you are agreeing to attempt to repair and rebuild a relationship that is experiencing difficulty . From each person , marriage counselling will require certain adjustments to previous attitudes and habits . The following are several things to expect when you enter into marriage counselling . An a neutral party , the marriage councillor needs to hear the thoughts , feelings and opinions of both parties in order to be able to make suggestions for ways to improve the marriage . In many cases the marriage relationship has declined primarily because of this lack of communication . Typically , councillor listen privately to each person , then bring them together again to discuss unresolved issues and set out goals and objectives for ways to improve the marriage . Hearing only one side of the story jeopardises the possibility of resolution being possible . If one or both persons are holding back communicating , it is a road block to moving ahead with a more positive future relationship . Honesty Is Critical For Progress If as a couple you have experienced the devastation of trust breakdown , marriage counselling my make it possible to repair that trust . However , if one or both people can not be honest about how they feel during the counselling sessions , it will only further enhance the distrust , and stop progress towards a healthy relationship .

One of these two was a huge fellow , almost a giant for stature , and armed with a two-handed sword , which he brandished like a switch . Against this opponent , with his reach of arm and the length and weight of his weapon , Dick and his bill were quite defenceless ; and had the other continued to join vigorously in the attack , the lad must have indubitably fallen . This second man , however , less in stature and slower in his movements , paused for a moment to peer about him in the darkness , and to give ear to the sounds of the battle . The giant still pursued his advantage , and still Dick fled before him , spying for his chance . Then the huge blade flashed and descended , and the lad , leaping on one side and running in , slashed sideways and upwards with his bill . A roar of agony responded , and , before the wounded man could raise his formidable weapon , Dick , twice repeating his blow , had brought him to the ground . The next moment he was engaged , upon more equal terms , with his second pursuer . Here there was no great difference in size , and though the man , fighting with sword and dagger against a bill , and being wary and quick of fence , had a certain superiority of arms , Dick more than made it up by his greater agility on foot . Neither at first gained any obvious advantage ; but the older man was still insensibly profiting by the ardour of the younger to lead him where he would ; and presently Dick found that they had crossed the whole width of",3.0

' The Eagle Huntress' Review : Nature Doc Doubles as Stellar Girl-Power Statement Portrait of Mongolian girl who defies tradition to become an eagle-hunting champion soars high ' The Eagle Huntress ' follows a preteen as she becomes Mongolia's first female hunter – Peter Travers on why this girl-power doc is a must-see . ' The Eagle Huntress' Review : Nature Doc Doubles as Stellar Girl-Power Statement There 's a spirit that soars in German filmmaker Otto Bell's first feature documentary , The Eagle Huntress , which tells the story of 13-year-old Aisholpan Nurgaiv and her quest to break through a centuries-old gender barrier . Specifically , she wants to become the first girl in 12 generations of her family to hunt game in partnership with a wild eagle . Girl power is the theme and the driving force behind the film – it 's narrated by the young Force Awakens discovery Daisy ( "" Rey "" ) Ridley – as Aisholpan shows her nomadic Kazakh tribe that she has the stuff to open up an honored position that 's been passed down from one generation of males to the next . Aisholpan's father has been awarded several medals for eagle training while her mother is mostly seen at home slaving over the stove . Point taken , though Bell rarely tires of remaking it . There are times when the footage Bell captures seems less found than engineered . But from the moment we see Aisholpan climb down a steep slope on the snow-covered Altai Mountains to capture an eaglet for training , we 're hooked . And watching her compete against grown men in the Golden Eagle Festival is especially satisfying as reflected in the eyes of the young girls who find inspiration in watching her . Simon",3.0

The nurse handed him to me and in those first few seconds , I felt relief . The months of anxiety were over . My naïve thought was : I can stop worrying now .

Well , they 'll die to be precise . Other types of substrate are : Laterite : Iron-rich clays , in a reddish colour , you can buy some in your local pet shop . Why bother ?

There is a question as to how much money do we save the government each year ? Despite local education authorities often stating in their literature that they wish to offer support to home educators in reality home educators in the UK receive no financial help of any kind ( either directly or indirectly ) . It is legally possible for local education authorities to offer such help but because they receive no budget for this they invariable refuse to offer any help . The education industry is huge . The UK government spends around £ 50 billion for all compulsory education in the UK . That works out at a total spending of a little over £ 5 , 000 a year per child , more if the child has a special educational need or lives in a remote rural location . It has been estimated that there are somewhere between 50,000 home educated children in the UK ( 2004 ) . So £ 5 , 000 per child would mean that home educators save the government £ 250million a year . This could be much more if , as many believe , SEN children are over represented in the home education community . It also saves on training . 50,000 children would require about 2,500 extra teachers nationally . Based upon an average teaching career of around 20 years then the government would have to train an extra 125 teachers a year . That is equal to three new teacher training colleges . Additionally there would need to be a number of new schools built . 50,000 home educated children reduces the national requirement for schools by around 75 primary schools and 35 secondary schools . Even if half of all home educated children were to be absorbed",3.0

While it 's good news from a marketer's "" budget "" standpoint , I am concerned that too many marketers are simply telling their clients that they "" must use social media "" without giving the client a clear-cut reason or a plan directly tying the social media campaign to a product or service . All social media marketing must have a purpose . There are a number of terrific uses you can put social media to : Instead of developing a new product or service in secret and then hoping you can market or sell it , use social media to engage potential clients and customers right from the beginning to get their feedback and input . That way , by the time you 're ready to go to market , you have a ready fan base who feel like the product or service is theirs and will immediately buy it . A great example of "" direct response "" social media marketing is the use of Twitter by Kogi Korean BBQ-To-Go in LA . They have trucks roaming the streets of LA selling Korean tacos . They use Twitter to keep raving fans up-to-date on where there truck is at all times . They also use it to tell fans about company news and recipes posted on their blog or website .

He did n't offer bonuses , he did n't "" give speeches to the troops , "" and he did n't threaten , cajole or harangue them .

Synopsis Padmé Amidala , former queen of the planet Naboo , comes to the city-world of Coruscant to take her seat in the senate of the Republic . She becomes the target of an assassination attempt , and the Jedi knight Obi-Wan Kenobi and his apprentice Anakin Skywalker are assigned to protect her . They track the assassination attempt back to bounty-hunter Jango Fett , and through him to an alliance of commercial interests - perhaps under the control of ' the Dark Side ' - who are seeking to secede from the Republic . Anakin accompanies Padmé back to Naboo where they begin to reveal their feelings for each other . Obi-Wan traces Jango to a forgotten ocean planet called Kamino , where an alien race has been building an army of clone warriors , and then to the barren world Geonosis , where Jango reports to Count Dooku , a powerful Jedi who leads the secession movement . On Coruscant , Chancellor Palpatine is granted emergency powers and decides to use the clone army of Kamino to fight for the Republic . Anakin and Padmé travel to Tatooine , Anakin's home planet , where he finds that his mother has been kidnapped by bandits . He arrives too late to rescue her and massacres her kidnappers indiscriminately . The droid R2-D2 arrives on Tatooine , carrying a distress call",3.0

Baby Alligators Young alligators are displayed year ' round and are released each fall and replaced by new hatchlings . The young are either carefully collected from a pod of hatchlings or hatched from collected eggs . A few of the babies are placed on display in the Nature Center . Some are also kept behind the scenes to be used for educational outreach events . The rest will be placed back with the mother alligator or if need be a different mother . Mother alligators will adopt and protect other babies . If it looks and sounds like a baby alligator she 'll accept it , no questions asked . The animals are kept in the nature center no longer than one year as they will become habituated to human contact if kept longer . At one year they are still young enough to revert back to their natural instincts that include a fear of humans . Alligator mating season takes place in the spring and nest building starts around the month of June . The mother alligator protects her nest from would-be predators such as raccoons and opossums . Any infestation of fire ants spells imminent disaster for the young . The eggs will be fine until hatching . Not only is the mother keeping an eye out for predators , she is also listening for chirping calls from the nest which is her signal the babies are ready to hatch . ( The babies will later use this chirping call as a distress call to the mother . ) The mother alligator will carefully dig through the nest helping the babies free themselves from the debris . With the use of an egg tooth , most of the babies are capable of hatching on their own .",3.0

Will shared-data plans drive more cellular-enabled tablet sales ? The answer depends on whether you think consumers view cellular connectivity as a necessity or an expendable option . Iain Gillott , founder of iGR Research , believes the plans will encourage sales , noting that the new shared data plans will mean that a current tablet user who is already paying for a cellular data plan will see his or her bill drop from $ 25 per month to $ 10 per month . "" I have an iPad today and have just stopped using the $ 25-a-month plan to use tethering . The new plans mean that the tablet would only be an extra $ 10 [ per month ] , which is reasonable , "" Gillott said via email . But Mark Lowenstein , founder of Mobile Ecosystem and a columnist for FierceWireless , said that he believes that operators may initially see a slight uptick in cellular-enabled tablet sales . But ultimately he said consumers will be more likely to buy Wi-Fi-only tablets and use them with their now "" free "" smartphone hotspot services offered under these shared plans . Both AT & T and Verizon include smartphone hotspot tethering – which allows smartphone users to share their cellular connection via a Wi-Fi hotspot broadcast through their smartphone – for no extra charge in their shared data plans .. CCS notes the reason for the decline is because "" most users do not regard cellular connectivity in tablets as a must-have , especially given the current price of tablets and mobile data subscriptions . "" The key word in the above statement from CCS is "" must-have . "" Although consumers might not consider cellular connectivity a necessity , so far many have purchased cellular-enabled tablets",3.0

Sometimes we get so lost in the excitement of developing and using new technologies that we do n't thoroughly examine their effect on the world around us . How Technology can Harm the Environment Many of the technologies we use every day consume a lot more resources and power than they need to , and using and manufacturing them can create a mess . Here are a few of the ways that technology can harm the environment : Pollution - Air , water , heat and noise pollution can all be caused by producing and using technology Consuming resources - Non-renewable resources , including precious metals like gold , are used to make technology . Many others , such as coal , are consumed to generate the electricity to use technology . Even some renewable resources , like trees and water , are becoming contaminated or are used up faster than they can renew themselves because of technology . Waste - Manufacturing technology creates large amounts of waste , and used computers and electronics get thrown out when they break or become outdated . Called "" technotrash , "" these electronics contain all sorts of hazardous materials that are very unsafe for the environment . They need to be disposed of using special methods . Disrupting ecology - Clearing land where animals used to live to build factories and allowing pollution to contaminate the food chain can greatly affect the environment's natural cycles . Health hazards - Using toxic materials that can harm our health can cause cancer , and technology addiction can lead to other health problems like obesity and carpal tunnel syndrome . You can encourage manufacturers by choosing to buy more energy-efficient and less hazardous electronics and by supporting companies that make protecting the environment a priority",3.0

III Chapter Three They were three full , exquisite days--a true honeymoon . They were at the Hotel-de-Boulogne , on the harbour ; and they lived there , with drawn blinds and closed doors , with flowers on the floor , and iced syrups were brought them early in the morning . Towards evening they took a covered boat and went to dine on one of the islands . It was the time when one hears by the side of the dockyard the caulking-mallets sounding against the hull of vessels . The smoke of the tar rose up between the trees ; there were large fatty drops on the water , undulating in the purple colour of the sun , like floating plaques of Florentine bronze . They rowed down in the midst of moored boats , whose long oblique cables grazed lightly against the bottom of the boat . The din of the town gradually grew distant ; the rolling of carriages , the tumult of voices , the yelping of dogs on the decks of vessels . She took off her bonnet , and they landed on their island . They sat down in the low-ceilinged room of a tavern , at whose door hung black nets . They ate fried smelts , cream and cherries . They lay down upon the grass ; they kissed behind the poplars ; and they would fain , like two Robinsons , have lived for ever in this little place , which seemed to them in their beatitude the most magnificent on earth . It was not the first time that they had seen trees , a blue sky , meadows ; that they had heard the water flowing and the wind blowing in the leaves ; but , no doubt",3.0

Archive for October , 2009 The study of the star signs is just a part of the complex astrological science , but it basically stands at the basis of the way people interpret their horoscope in relation with the position of the celestial bodies . Who trusts the horoscopes ? Modern man no longer believes the predictions of the horoscope particularly since they are usually written in a very aleatory manner without any connection with the real study of the star signs . If you read your horoscope in the daily newspaper and you often noticed discrepancies with other publications , remember that nobody "" cares "" to look into the stars for answers anymore . The star signs could reveal very important aspects and potential directions in one's life , but , complex astrological analyses are performed only by the true "" scientists "" of the zodiac . People are surprised to discover how many of the predicted or revealed aspects are true , though they may totally contradict the predictions in a magazine horoscope column . According to the star signs , one's individuality is triggered by the star sign whereas the personality comes from the ascending sign corresponding to the time of the birth . The directions in one's life and the potential creativity of the person could be influenced by the position of the stars and planets in the individual astrological chart . Though many web sites advertise the comprehensiveness of their star signs charts , there is almost impossible to reveal all the aspects by such a readings . Therefore , the data gathered by a professional astrologer could be instructive but functioning as general guidelines that help you comprehend and explore personal nature ; such star signs analyses could in fact improve self-awareness ,",3.0

Two fantastic goals and one quite wonderful assist swung a captivating Clasico against Real Madrid in Barcelona's favour . And yet , after the game , nobody was talking about the Argentine forward . There were other talking points , of course . There was Marcelo's foul on Cesc Fabregas , Jose Mourinho poking Barca assistant coach Tito Vilanova in the eye , David Villa's slap on Mesut Ozil and a whole host of other ill-tempered incidents , not to mention an epic encounter between two superb sides . Nevertheless , Messi's masterclass had been the difference between a magnificent Madrid and a Barca team struggling to keep the pace with their biggest rivals . Having netted a vital goal in the first leg at the Santiago Bernabeu , Leo won the return almost single-handedly . It was a performance worthy of acclaim and accolades aplenty , of extreme eulogy .

Léon Davent was a French printmaker in the mid 16th century , closely associated with the First School of Fontainebleau . He worked in both engraving and etching and many of his works are based on designs by Francesco Primaticcio , "" rendered boldly and freely "" . Others use designs by Luca Penni and other artists . It is thought that there was a workshop at the Palace of Fontainebleau itself in the 1540s , where he was one of the leading printmakers . Their main purpose seems to have been to record the new style being forged at Fontainebleau , copying both the main subject paintings and the elaborate ornamental stuccos and other decorations . Nymph mutilating a Satyr With a couple of exceptions his prints are signed only with "" L.D. "" , and his identity was long uncertain ; he is known as the Master L.D. in older literature . Lists of his works have attributed between 98 ( Henri Zerner ) and 226 ( F. Herbet ) prints to him . Hunting Scene , perhaps Death of Acteon . Signed "" Bologna "" . Very little is known about his life ; his dated prints run between 1540 and 1556 , when he left a series incomplete , which may indicate his death . There is no evidence that he trained as a painter , and like many early engravers he may have been trained as a goldsmith , a trade where engraving was still important . His engravings , which are presumed to be his earliest works , show a considerable fluency in this difficult technique . According to Henri Zerner , he may have produced about 9 early prints before moving to Fontainebleau , and he may only have started etching , rather",3.0

How to Motivate and Counsel Your Sales Force Lead from the Front with Respect-Building Attention to Your Team's Concerns The salesperson personality is unique . Managing salespeople effectively requires motivating and counseling them on a far more elevated level than ordinary employees need . A powerful way to meet this sales management challenge is to create a highly motivated work environment . To help a strong performer to get past a slump , the soft approach is most likely to succeed . Question the salesperson as to where you have failed , rather than making intrusive demands to know what 's wrong with him or her . Lead from the front with respect-building attention to your team's concerns . Driving from the rear with the whip of intimidation probably never worked well ; today it makes building and retaining a strong sales team virtually impossible . </doc>",3.0

Senior agricultural sector authorities visited three sustainable agriculture farms in Costa Rica ; will attempt to promote the application of such practices in their country ACCORDING TO DAVID ESTWICK , Minister of Agriculture , Food , Fisheries , Industry and Small Business Development of Barbados , finding a way to ensure that cooperation goes beyond regional fora and actually reaches their framers , and supporting the modernization of agricultural sector institutions , are two of the most important objectives of the relationship between IICA and Barbados . On his visit to Headquarters , Estwick was accompanied by Deputy Minister Ralph Farnum . The visit was organized by IICA's Hemispheric Center for Leadership in Agriculture , under its Forum for Leaders in Agriculture program . He is the fourteenth minister or secretary of agriculture to participate in these official visits , said Hernan Chiriboga , Coordinator of the Center . During his meeting with the managers , Minister Estwick stated it was necessary to "" change the reality "" in some Caribbean states , which are in need of technological tools that will ensure that innovation reaches farmers and contribute to making them more competitive . According to James French , Director of Technical Cooperation , the IICA 2012-2014 Medium-term Plan calls for strengthening the technical cooperation provided in the Caribbean , since it is clear that global situations , such a climate change and the need to gain a foothold in external markets , make it necessary for agriculture to become more competitive .

Single Parent Struggle For many years , children growing up in a single parent family have been viewed as different . Being raised by only one parent seems impossible to many yet over the decades it has become more prevalent . In today's society many children have grown up to become emotionally stable and successful whether they had one or two parents to show them the rocky path that life bestows upon all human beings . The problem lies in the difference of children raised by single parents versus children raised by both a mother and a father . Does a child need both parents ? Does a young boy need a father figure around ? Does the government provide help for single parents ? What role do step-parents and step-siblings play ? With much speculation , this topic has become a very intriguing argument . What people must understand is that properly raising a child does not rely on the structure of a family but should be more focused on the process or values that are taught to these children as they learn to mature . Children of single parents can be just as progressive with emotional , social and behavioral skills as those with two parents . People claim that the only way for children to gain full emotional and behavioral skills is to be raised by both a mother and a father . When a topic such as this one has a broad amount of variables it is impossible to simply link these problems to only having one parent . In the article , "" Single-parent families cause juvenile crime "" , author Robert L. Maginnis states , "" Children from single-parent families are more likely to have behavior problems because they tend to lack economic security",3.0

Grandmaster ( chess ) The title Grandmaster is awarded to chess players by the world chess organization FIDE . Apart from World Champion , Grandmaster is the highest title a chess player can attain . Once achieved , the title is held for life . In chess literature it is usually abbreviated to GM . ( Other titles are also often abbreviated : FM for FIDE Master , IM for International Master , and CM for Candidate Master . ) The abbreviation IGM for International Grandmaster is also sometimes used , particularly in older literature . Grandmaster , International Master , and FIDE Master are open to both men and women . A number of women have earned the GM title , with the first two having been Nona Gaprindashvili in 1978 and Susan Polgar in 1991 . Since about 2000 , most of the top 10 women have held the GM title . A separate gender-segregated title , Woman Grandmaster ( WGM ) , is also available . It is awarded to women who attain a level of skill between that of a FIDE Master and an International Master . The first known use of the term grandmaster in connection with chess was in an 1838 issue of Bell's Life , in which a correspondent referred to William Lewis as "" our past grandmaster "" . Lewis himself later referred to Philidor as a grandmaster , and the term was also applied to a few other players . In the Ostend tournament of 1907 the term grandmaster ( Großmeister in German ) was used . The tournament was divided into two sections : the Championship Tournament and the Masters' Tournament . The Championship section was for players who had previously won an international tournament . Siegbert Tarrasch won the",3.0

The Knoxville , Tenn. , chain has invested more than $ 10 million in the glasses , which were developed by Sony Electronics Inc. Resembling thick sunglasses , the device uses holographic technology to project closed-caption text that appears inside the lenses , synchronized with the dialogue on the screen .

N AN EARLIER ISSUE of this magazine we noted that in the approach to the 1997 general election the public debate on constitutional issues covered a wider range of topics than perhaps ever in the history of the British Isles . Regrettably , after the date of the election was announced these issues were almost ignored as the party propagandists and the editors of the news media concentrated their thoughts on the corruption seemingly then inseparable from political life . The serious consequences of this unbalanced approach aggravated one of the greatest weaknesses of the British style of democracy ~ the confrontational two-party system that suppresses those issues neither of the two main parties wishes to have fully discussed , and then claims that the winning party has "" a mandate "" to execute whatever policies have been included in its manifesto , whether or not they have been adequately debated in public . The electorate that traditionally accepted the limitations of the system has begun to question it , partly because there is growing unease about the competence and integrity of the nation's politicians , of course , and partly because a constitution which is not yet proved to have "" broken "" is about to be "" mended "" for no obviously rational purpose . Voters now have to recognise that if they supported Tony Blair because they believed John Major to be incompetent , they are claimed as supporters of a Scottish Parliament ( and to have voted for the disintegration of the United Kingdom that may one day follow in consequence ) .

Climate change : a survivors' guide 1 Stay cool , dry Britain is expected to get more extremes of heat and rainfall , so prepare for more severe floods , longer droughts and more powerful storms . No one knows quite what the effect over time will be of a slowing Gulf stream , or the melting of arctic sea ice , but climate scientists confidently expect temperatures to rise up to 4C by 2100 . That could mean big shifts in rainfall patterns and a more unpredictable climate . So clear your drains , fix your roof and move to Wales – or at least to somewhere with good water supply . The worst that could happen ? Your grandchildren will inherit inexorably rising temperatures that render much of the Earth uninhabitable . Their problem ? Yes , but yours , too . 2 Move Sea levels are rising gradually and by the end of the century could be nearly 2ft higher than they are today . So do n't pass on that beach hut to your children , and expect to lose acres if you live near the coast in East Anglia and other low lying areas . You wo n't have to head for the hills for many years , but prepare to view the seaside from behind higher walls and from the dykes that will be needed to protect many coastal towns . By 2100 the map of Britain will be smaller and many cities are likely to be besieged by climate "" refugees "" arriving from low-lying areas such as Norfolk . 3 Adapt Climate change is going to be very , very expensive , and the poor , the old and the vulnerable will be the most affected because they are least likely to",3.0

Recent theoretical studies have suggested that the observed suppression of superconductivity in superconductor / ferromagnet ( S / F ) heterostructures could be modulated by controlling the ferromagnetic exchange interaction in the superconductor . The exchange interaction in the superconductor is the sum of the exchange interaction from the ferromagnetic regions , which has a phase and magnitude that depends upon the direction that the ferromagnet is magnetised and the distance . As the exchange interaction has a phase it is possible that the contribution from two regions will cancel out . The exchange interaction , which can be viewed as an imbalance in the spin populations , suppresses superconductivity so any reduction in the exchange interaction will increase the superconducting transition temperature ( Tc ) of the heterostructure . Thus by changing the magnetisation of the ferromagnetic regions it is possible to control the exchange interaction in the superconductor and so the superconducting p. .. </doc>",3.0

CHAPTER II AT SICCA Two days afterwards the Mercenaries left Carthage . They had each received a piece of gold on the condition that they should go into camp at Sicca , and they had been told with all sorts of caresses : "" You are the saviours of Carthage ! But you would starve it if you remained there ; it would become insolvent . Withdraw ! The Republic will be grateful to you later for all this condescension . We are going to levy taxes immediately ; your pay shall be in full , and galleys shall be equipped to take you back to your native lands . "" They did not know how to reply to all this talk . These men , accustomed as they were to war , were wearied by residence in a town ; there was difficulty in convincing them , and the people mounted the walls to see them go away . They defiled through the street of Khamon , and the Cirta gate , pell-mell , archers with hoplites , captains with soldiers , Lusitanians with Greeks . They marched with a bold step , rattling their heavy cothurni on the paving stones . Their armour was dented by the catapult , and their faces blackened by the sunburn of battles . Hoarse cries issued from their thick bears , their tattered coats of mail flapped upon the pommels of their swords , and through the holes in the brass might be seen their naked limbs , as frightful as engines of war . Sarissae , axes , spears , felt caps and bronze helmets , all swung together with a single motion . They filled the street thickly enough to have made the walls crack , and the long mass",3.0

With the Alsa-Max PURI-027 you will experience a whole new world of paint delivery and efficiency . By eliminating the static charge on the surface as well as in your actual air supply you will see an immediate difference . Without static , paint particles are able to align perfectly on the surface ( see below ) meaning less material needed for complete coverage essentially achieving in 2 coats what would normally take 3-4 coats . Aside from the coverage , by "" IONIZING "" your air supply you can now eliminate dust and debris from the surface of plastics etc. by simply blowing it with air , once the surface has been "" blown "" off the surface is now "" IONIZED "" and static free meaning the dust and debris ca n't return . As you can see by using the Alsa-Max PURI-027 you will use less material , have a much cleaner finish , experience faster dry time and above all achieve a better finish to every project . </doc>",3.0

One thing you are likely to come across during the promotion of your website is link exchange programs . Essentially this is the process of obtaining a free link on a particular site by agreeing to place a link to them on your site . Be careful however not to link to ' bad neighbourhoods ' , this is what many search engines refer to as sites that attempt to exploit or degrade the relevancy of their search results . Bad neighbourhoods tend to include sites involved in link pyramids , link farms and any other activity that requires you to download pages of links to your website . Linking to bad neighbourhoods may well harm your pagerank and will not improve your position one iota . Check the pagerank of the site the listing is offered on and decide whether a link exchange would be a fair deal for both parties . If your pagerank is 0 then you wo n ' t have much to bargain with , alternatively if your pagerank is 6 then it will not be advantageous to pursue a link on a site with a pagerank of 0 . </doc>",3.0

Nature of problem : With the present program the derivation of the coefficients produced by the equation ( 14 ) is obtained . The first part of the proposed program consists of the calculation of the matrix elements which form the coefficients of the system of equations . The second part of the proposed program , as this has been explained in [ 1 ] , [ 2 ] and [ 3 ] , consists of the iterative application of the L ' Hospital's rule ( to avoid coefficients of the form 0 / 0 ) for the computation of the solution of these equations that make up the coefficients of the method ( 14 ) . We note that the system of equations produced by the equation ( 14 ) is solved by an application of Cramer's rule . The above procedure is repeated for the calculation of the coefficients of the methods ( 24 ) - ( 25 ) and for the methods ( 28 ) - ( 29 ) . Solution method : Symbolic computation using Maple .

II . Proletarians and Communists In what relation do the Communists stand to the proletarians as a whole ? The Communists do not form a separate party opposed to the other working-class parties . They have no interests separate and apart from those of the proletariat as a whole . They do not set up any sectarian principles of their own , by which to shape and mould the proletarian movement . The Communists are distinguished from the other working-class parties by this only : 1 . In the national struggles of the proletarians of the different countries , they point out and bring to the front the common interests of the entire proletariat , independently of all nationality . 2 . In the various stages of development which the struggle of the working class against the bourgeoisie has to pass through , they always and everywhere represent the interests of the movement as a whole . The Communists , therefore , are on the one hand , practically , the most advanced and resolute section of the working-class parties of every country , that section which pushes forward all others ; on the other hand , theoretically , they have over the great mass of the proletariat the advantage of clearly understanding the line of march , the conditions , and the ultimate general results of the proletarian movement . The immediate aim of the Communists is the same as that of all other proletarian parties : formation of the proletariat into a class , overthrow of the bourgeois supremacy , conquest of political power by the proletariat . The theoretical conclusions of the Communists are in no way based on ideas or principles that have been invented , or discovered , by this or that would-be universal reformer",3.0

Business continuity plans must address massive air travel shutdown When the ash cloud from Iceland's Eyjafjallajökull volcano shut down air travel across Europe and beyond , the business continuity plans of stranded British comedian John Cleese included hiring a Mercedes cab and forking over the roughly $ 5 , 000 fare For many a business continuity manager , however , the punch line was probably a good deal less existential . Losses for the airlines alone surpassed $ 1 billion . That figure does not include the toll on organizations crippled by their inability to ship or receive materials by air -- or the effect on business from the stranding of employees . "" What we really had here was asymmetrical reliance on one or two modes of transportation , oceangoing vehicles and air travel , "" said business continuity specialist Donald Byrne , managing director of consulting firm North River Solutions Inc. "" The trains were n't disrupted , and the bus lines and the automobiles were not disrupted . But you ca n't use those across the Atlantic Ocean . "" Now that the dust has settled , experts like Byrne are urging business continuity managers -- including those at businesses not affected by the ash cloud -- to use the event as a teachable moment while the chaos it caused is still relatively fresh in people's minds . For starters , the volcanic eruption should serve as a sober reminder that even rare events with limited physical destructiveness can cause widespread chaos , said Roberta Witty , a business continuity analyst at Gartner Inc. The eruption of Eyjafjallajökull resulted in the largest-ever interruption of global air travel . Nor may that event be so rare .

Ecology is quite often seen as the domain of enthusiasts , whose hearts sometimes get in the way of their heads . This is some times true , but is not always an entirely bad thing . In the past it has sometimes been a necessary part of the process of change , that people have protested about things that they instinctively felt were wrong even if they did not have all the necessary information to support their views . We are now moving into a new era of understanding , where there is plenty of scientific evidence to support a whole range of environmental concerns . As a result many major institutions , such as Governments , banks , insurance and pensions funds , and even industrial multi-nationals are not only taking note of ecological issues , but are being pro-active in these areas . This is heartening but also brings with it new risks and challenges , the main of which are bureaucratisation and inflexibility . It is important that these institutions are integrated with the ecological agenda , but not at the cost of the agenda being for ever postponed , or diminished . It is also vital that the ecologists listen carefully to what the major institutions and the mainstream intellectual community are saying , so that effort is not wasted on trying to implement impossible or irrelevant strategies . Whatever aims that the ecological movement have now need to be subjected to strict reality tests , as to their scientific integrity , and the viability of making them happen in today's world . That said , it is important to understand that much ecological thinking and practice is at the cutting edge of scientific understanding , and can only be tested by people embracing new",3.0

Nature of problem : The analytical calculations using vector calculus that appear in plasma physics , fluid dynamics , and other fields sometimes can become extremely complex . The complexity usually originates from both the vector operations themselves and the underlying coordinate systems . Solution method : To implement automatic symbolic vector analysis in general coordinate systems , we need a simple and systematic mathematical framework . The modern viewpoint of 3D vector calculus , differential forms on 3-manifolds , is utilized for this purpose . On the other hand , a well - developed high level programming language with a symbolic computation capability is also necessary . To the end , we chose Mathematica by Wolfram Research Inc. Unusual features : Asymptotic capabilities , 2D vector analysis notation , and a simple interface for users to define their own coordinate systems . Running time : Running time is problem and machine dependent . Running Mathematica 3.0 on a Pentium II 150 MHz PC with 48M memory , is takes about 2 second CPU time to carry out a single vector differential operation to the second order of the inverse aspect ratio in the large aspect ratio circular concentric tokamak coordinate system . </doc>",3.0

- Will there be less time for shared family activities and attention for the members due to the new business venture ? How great a time loss would the members be willing to accept ? - Are all the family members ready and eager to launch this business and believe it will be a success ? Are the family members aware that the new business might not reach its financial goal or even fail which is a frequent occurrence with new businesses ? - How long a time span does the family think should be allowed for the business to remain a going concern if it is not living up to expectations and not generating enough or any revenue ? If that happens , should it simply be shuttered or should there be an attempt to sell it off ? - Is there a contingency plan in the event that the new business goes under ? Not all of these questions will yield immediate and thoroughly thought out answers before the business goes into operation or until it has been operating for a while . Many things can change that will impact the new business so it is helpful to go back over this list with the family members roughly twice a year to see if there are new opinions or additional input from the members . Your family needs to feel connected and supportive of your new business plan or there can come a day when the family unit can break down . Most people do not want to lose their family to divorce or alienation because they allowed themselves to become obsessed with an idea or business plan .

The 2006 Annual Exhibition took place on 11th November and proved to be another very successful event with a good turnout of members and guests . As this year has been an exceptional one for migrants it was not surprising that many exhibits displayed specimens of rare migrants , and several moth species new to Britain . As an experiment this year , and in response to requests made in the questionnaire circulated last year , Pemberley Books were invited to have a book stand at the exhibition , and it is hoped that this was a financial success for them . No doubt the BENHS Council will consider whether to repeat this venture in future years . In past years trading has been limited to the Society's own publications plus those of the London Natural History Society , and the Royal Entomological Society , with whom we have strong links . Around 40 people stayed to enjoy an excellent evening meal at Imperial College , a fitting end to a most enjoyable exhibition . The date of the 2007 exhibition will be posted to this site as soon as the booking has been made and confirmed . It is likely to be held on Saturday 10th November 2007 at Imperial College .

Whether your noticeability factor comes from showing up to talk to coaches , sending tapes , asking your current coaches for recommendations , or just making a phone call to the target school's athletic department , there are things you can do to set yourself apart from other athletes . The problem most athletes face is that they do n't know where to start . Where and to who do you mail things , who can you ask for advice , what do coaches look for from an athlete and at what age should you start looking at prospects . Consultant Jack Renkens dealt with these issues first hand when his daughter became a highly recruited high school basketball player , eventually packaging his experiences with his coaching and athletic background and founding a company called Recruiting Realities . "" Our primary goal is to show students and families that there are opportunities out there to get funding and to go somewhere where they can play , "" Renkens said . "" If a school does n't pay in some way , shape or fashion , whether it 's a grant , an award , or however , then they do n't believe you can play , "" Renkens said . "" They 're putting you on a tryout . I 'm just trying to eliminate that from happening – a young man or a young woman getting their heart broken that they",3.0

Hi , my name is Marcin -- farmer , technologist . I was born in Poland , now in the U. S. I started a group called Open Source Ecology . We 've identified the 50 most important machines that we think it takes for modern life to exist -- things from tractors , bread ovens , circuit makers . Then we set out to create an open source , DIY , do it yourself version that anyone can build and maintain at a fraction of the cost . We call this the Global Village Construction Set . So let me tell you a story . So I finished my 20s with a Ph. D. in fusion energy , and I discovered I was useless . I had no practical skills . The world presented me with options , and I took them . I guess you can call it the consumer lifestyle . So I started a farm in Missouri and learned about the economics of farming . I bought a tractor -- then it broke . I paid to get it repaired -- then it broke again . Then pretty soon I was broke too . I realized that the truly appropriate , low-cost tools that I needed to start a sustainable farm and settlement just did n't exist yet . I needed tools that were robust , modular , highly efficient and optimized , low-cost , made from local and recycled materials that would last a lifetime , not designed for obsolescence . I found that I would have to build them myself . So I did just that . And I tested them . And I found that industrial productivity can be achieved on a small scale . So then I published the 3D designs ,",3.0

Most patients who are looking for cosmetic procedures are regular professional who would like to spend a bit of their hard-earned money to look and feel better .

Well , I 'm involved in other things besides physics . In fact , mostly now in other things . One thing is distant relationships among human languages . And the professional , historical linguists in the US and in Western Europe mostly try to stay away from any long-distance relationships ; big groupings , groupings that go back a long time , longer than the familiar families . They do n't like that ; they think it 's crank . I do n't think it 's crank . And there are some brilliant linguists , mostly Russians , who are working on that at Santa Fe Institute and in Moscow , and I would love to see where that leads . Does it really lead to a single ancestor some 20 , 25,000 years ago ? And what if we go back beyond that single ancestor , when there was presumably a competition among many languages ? How far back does that go ? How far back does modern language go ? How many tens of thousands of years does it go back ? Chris Anderson : Do you have a hunch or a hope for what the answer to that is ? Murray Gell-Mann : Well , I would guess that modern language must be older than the cave paintings and cave engravings and cave sculptures and dance steps in the soft clay in the caves in Western Europe in the Aurignacian Period some 35,000 years ago , or earlier . I ca n ' t believe they did all those things and did n't also have a modern language . So I would guess that the actual origin goes back at least that far and maybe further .

Patience is n't so much something believers receive as it is an attribute that they develop over time and through experience . Think of patience as a muscle that you have to use in order to see it build . To that end , believers should recognize difficulty as an opportunity to flex their patience . The human instinct is to cry out to God in bewilderment when tribulation comes knocking . We blame . We resist . We complain . Humanly speaking , praising the Lord for tribulation is unnatural . However , doing so begins to make sense to believers when they cling to God's promise that good comes from hardship . Accepting hardship as a means of growth is a radical concept in this world . Even more extreme is the believer who praises the Lord for the storm . But God's followers have cause to rejoice . Tribulation increases our patience so that we can stand firm on His promises and await His good timing . </doc>",3.0

Stylized Facts and Experimentation Charles Crabtree , Christopher J.

"" Our focus is on the relationship between stylized facts and experimentation . Given the continued increase in experimentation across the social sciences , we think that it is important to consider the exact role that experiments play in the production and testing of stylized facts . We make three related contributions here . First , we describe how experiments can both provide new evidence to support existing stylized facts as well as produce new stylized facts . Second , we argue that the stylized facts produced through experimentation differ from other stylized facts . Third , we extend Hirschman's ( 2016 ) definition of "" stylized facts "" so that it distinguishes between those that describe correlation relationships and those that describe causal relationships .

Here 's a quick & dirty of the ' trouble ' currently plaguing Paula Deen . A former employee of Deen and her brother Bubba Hiers filed a lawsuit against them , citing both sexual and racial discrimination . At the forefront of the allegations were Deen's own racist remarks and her usage of the "" n-word . "" During her deposition , Deen admitted that she had used the word before on several occasions . She insisted that neither she nor her family were racist or stereotyped or discriminated against any race or gender . But the racially-charged language she readily used ( and admitted to ) suggested something entirely different . During her deposition she even admitted to planning an old fashioned southern event , complete with a black-only staff of servants . She stated that she decided against the party because of the obvious backlash and public relations problems that would have obviously resulted from it . Once all this information became public , people began to come out of the woodwork to condemn Deen , her show , and her apparently racist position . She immediately released a video apology that appeared rushed , forced , half-hearted , and disingenuous . She later released a second apology which brought a similar amount of ire . Most opponents claimed that Deen did n't mean what she was saying when she apologized and that she was forced into it to try and save face . But unfortunately for Paula Deen , her apologies most definitely did not save face . Funny thing – in show business today , most people do n't take too kindly to racism . In the wake of this sensation , the Food Network decided against renewing Deen's contract ( which expired yesterday )",3.0

Of these , 185 were for the new 787 Dreamliner that is set to be delivered in 2008 , reports Reuters . The news comes shortly after Airbus announced it has agreed a deal with the Chinese government to manufacture 150 jets . Both Airbus and Boeing have been in competition this year to secure orders from airlines . Become an AOA Associate Member </doc>",3.0

As the year pass by and as the society become more complex , innovations in the sphere of health and beauty has become more competitive . Way back then , furniture and fixture in the house remained loyal to its dual purpose of functionality and aesthetics . Fairly recently , these purposes have been rolled into one , along with another more profound purpose tagged as therapeutic purpose . Hydrotherapy Showers Hydrotherapy showers are one of these household fixtures which has increased and improved functionality . Aside from being a mere fixture used to take a bath , it has now an additional , and more important purpose of improving blood circulation , increasing metabolism uptake , and aiding in beating cell aging . Hydrotherapy showers also serve the purpose of hydrating the cells by killing dead cells and nurturing the new ones . It 's as if your entire being is renewed after taking a bath using that shower . An added bonus is that the process is all natural . You do n't have to go through surgeries or have to drink pills to improve your skin and glow . All you have to do is to bask under the warm water dripping all over your body and feel it nourish your being . The experience is a total indulgence . You really wo n't have to worry about adverse to your liver or to your internal organs as you do n't need to drink or inject to your body any kind of medicine or supplement . An hour of luxury bath could serve you way too many purposes . The human body has been made vulnerable to different kinds of sicknesses because of the complexity in the society .

The amount of rain , snow , or other precipitation falling on a given spot on Earth's surface during the year depends a lot on where that spot is . Is it in a desert ( which receives little rain ) ? Is it in a rainforest ( which receives vast amounts of rain ) ? Or is it located somewhere between these two extremes ? Often precipitation runs off along the surface back to the ocean , but it can be held for a time in lakes . Lakes in wetter regions are relatively permanent features , but those in drier regions may be less stable and thus more sensitive to changes in precipitation from season to season and water withdrawals from human activities . The list below discusses some of Earth's lakes that belong to the second category . This lake in west-central Bolivia occupies a shallow depression in the Altiplano , or high plateau , at 12,090 feet ( 3 , 686 meters ) above sea level . Historically the country's second largest lake , it covered 977 square miles ( 2 , 530 square km ) at low stage and was about 56 miles ( 90 km ) long and 20 miles ( 32 km ) wide though only 8 to 10 feet ( 2 . 4 to 3 meters ) deep . By December 2015 , however , the lake had completely dried up as a result of the combined effects of climate change-exacerbated drought and sediment buildup caused by the local mining industry . Since the 1990s , as the process of global warming brought increased temperatures to the region , the evaporation rate for the lake tripled . Lacking a sufficient interval of normal rainfall to replenish its waters , the lake became",3.0

The Cuban Missile Crisis at 50 CAMBRIDGE – This month marks the 50th anniversary of the Cuban missile crisis – those 13 days in October 1962 that were probably the closest the world has come to a major nuclear war . President John F. Kennedy had publicly warned the Soviet Union [ 178 ] not to introduce offensive missiles into Cuba . But Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev decided to cross Kennedy's red line surreptitiously and confront the Americans with a fait accompli . When an American surveillance plane discovered the missiles , the crisis erupted . Some of Kennedy's advisers urged an air strike and invasion to destroy the missiles . Kennedy mobilized troops , but also bought time by [ 179 ] announcing a naval blockade of Cuba . The crisis subsided when Soviet ships carrying additional missiles turned back , and Khrushchev agreed to remove the existing missiles from the island . As then US Secretary of State Dean Rusk put it : "" We were eyeball to eyeball , and I think the other fellow just blinked . "" At first glance , this was a rational and predictable outcome . The United States had a 17-to-1 advantage in nuclear weaponry . The Soviets were simply outgunned . And yet the US did not preemptively attack Soviet missile sites , which were relatively vulnerable , because the risk that even one or two of the Soviet missiles would be fired at an American city was enough to deter a first strike . In addition , both Kennedy and Khrushchev feared that rational strategies and careful calculation might spin out of control . Khrushchev offered a vivid metaphor in one of his letters to Kennedy : [ 180 ] "" We and you ought not now to pull",3.0

What Teeth Do Kids Lose and When ? If all your kids want for Christmas ( or Halloween , or Easter ) is their two front teeth , chances are , they 're about six years old . While the timing and order of losing teeth varies , there are a few basics you should know about what teeth kids lose – and when . There may be a few exceptions , but for the most part , kids lose teeth in the order that they received them in the first place . If you remember taking photos of little Tommy's first tooth , you may already have a pretty good idea of which baby tooth will be the first to go . For most kids , the first baby teeth lost are the lower central incisors and the upper central incisors . These , for the non-dental world , are known as the two upper front teeth and the two lower front teeth . While the incisors will fall out around six to seven years of age , you may be wondering the timing of the other teeth . The other teeth , including the first and second molars , will fall out by age 11 or twelve . What Teeth do Kids Lose ? Well , all of them – all of their baby teeth , that is . Kids get 20 baby teeth , starting from infancy . Most kids will have all 20 baby teeth by the time they 're three years old . And once those choppers are in , you may wonder how important it is to properly care for these temporary residents . Answer – pretty important ! Even though you know what teeth your kids will lose , there are some compelling",3.0

Looking back at your childhood what are the earliest memories of how the washing was done ? With a scrubbing board in a tin tub , and a dolly peg in a tub , boiling in the cellar with a fire underneath the water container . Also there were conveniences for the general public at that time . The city were I lived had a lot of baths and wash houses . They were combined with the public swimming baths and they gave the service of letting people go along to use their machines , which were huge . And you could often see people with prams pushing them down the streets with ... In those days potatoes used to come in big wicker baskets , and they 'd have a wicker basket in this pram and all the family washing . As much as they could possibly get in that wicker basket was put in there , and they wheeled it to the nearest public wash house and baths , and when it came back it was dry-ish , rather than having wet washing hanging around the house , as it would have been if it had been done in the house . You mentioned a dolly peg , what was that ? Yes , a dolly peg it was a little bit ... It was , I suppose , about 4 foot high , a little bit like a milking stool at the bottom , with a long pole in the centre , two handles at the top and you agitated it : a manual agitator . And for the very dirty bits on the working shirts , or whatever there was , you 'd have a scrubbing board . And that would stand in the water and",3.0

Some common signs of vision problems include headache and fatigue , holding reading material closer than normal , turning or tilting the head to use one eye only or consistently performing below potential . But vision changes can occur without you or your child noticing them and a school or pediatrician's vision screening is not a substitute for a thorough eye examination . An eye examination at Thomas Eye Group will examine the health of the eyes , including the front and back and a check to see if a prescription is needed for glasses . It also includes a check to make sure eyes focus well together ruling out a "" lazy "" or wandering eye that can hinder depth perception .

Lupus : Jess' story Have you ever heard of lupus ? Well , I 'm Jessica , and I 'm nine years old , and that 's what I have . Here 's how it all started . When I was eight years old , I was sick for a very long time . I got poked a lot and it hurt , but I got used to it . I learned that I had something called pericarditis .

That 's when I found out that I had lupus , and that 's when I learned that it was lupus all along that caused the problem with my heart .

I was n't really fat . The medicine that I needed to take made me look that way , that 's all . I was sad , so I asked my mother to come in and talk to the kids about lupus and about what I had been through . She 's a nurse , so she really can help kids to understand things .

Moral Difference Between Hitting a Computer and Hitting a Person The contemporary reality with its unceasing progress has caused a lot of changes in the life of every single person on the planet . Nowadays , computers surround us almost everywhere . Of course they are primarily there to facilitate our existence and save our time by presenting us ready results of their activity . Nevertheless , their constant presence has created several disputes for the humanity one of which is the inclination of human beings to "" animate "" computers . Ascribing personalities to computers may be easily observed through the way people talk about computers and even treat then . Computers get names , are punished by turning them off improperly and rewarded by getting new soft or hardware for them . That is to say that if we talk about morality concerning people it may be appropriate to talk about morality concerning computers . Suppose , some person gets mad and punches a computer for not working "" right "" and then later on when meeting a friend gets annoyed by him and punches him too . It goes without saying that such a behavior towards a friend can be a subject to morality . What about the other victim ? Is a computer-violence in this case a subject of morality , too ? Well , as everything else in this world it is rather comparatively . It completely depends of the details of a given situation . If this same person really does consider his computer to be "" alive "" , then the morality of his action is voidable . And if he does not consider his computer to be "" animated "" his action is nothing more that a result of his dissatisfaction with",3.0

Four-step guide to investing in shares : 1 ) Keep track of your shares . Make sure no major event has occurred that may affect the fundamentals of the company . Usually you may not bother about the fundamentals of the company . Usually you may not bother about the fundamentals while choosing a derivatives strategy . But never do a covered call on a fundamentally unsound company . 2 ) Avoid volatile shares . Opt for shares that rise gradually or move in a range . 3 ) At the end of any month , sell only the near-month options and not the mid-month ones . For example , at the end of July one should sell the August-maturity call option and not the September-maturity one . It can be mathematically proved , and also been seen that one usually makes more money this way . 4 ) Leave room for the share price : selection of strike price must depend on the view of the share price , and not on the yield by selling the option . The best-sold options are those that do n't get exercised against you-not those that give you higher upfront fee . </doc>",3.0

Interactions between Earth's atmosphere and oceans drive weather and climate patterns . Although these interactions and patterns are complex , they are also predictable . This animation from The New Media Studio explains precipitation patterns by illustrating how differences in ocean surface temperatures create wind , and how wind patterns can in turn affect ocean surface temperatures . The Sun's energy is distributed unevenly across Earth's surface . Areas near our planet's equator absorb far more heat energy than areas near the poles . This uneven distribution of heat creates instability in Earth's atmosphere and oceans , and instability leads to movement of air and water . Air in the atmosphere is warmed by heat radiating from Earth's surface . The warmer the surface is , the warmer the air above it becomes . Because warm air is less dense than cold air , it tends to expand and rise , which lowers air pressure near the surface . Thus , regions of low air pressure generally form over warm water and land , while high-pressure regions form over cool surfaces . Such pressure differences create circular patterns of air called convection currents . In a convection current , warmer , low-pressure air rises and cooler , high-pressure air rushes in to fill the void . As the warm air rises , it loses heat in the upper atmosphere , cools , and sinks back toward Earth's surface , completing the circuit . The movement of air from high to low pressure in convection currents is responsible for most winds that blow across Earth's surface . The northern and southern hemispheres each have three zones in which winds blow predictably from east to west or west to east . On either side of the equator are zones dominated by the",3.0

I thought I would talk a little bit about how nature makes materials . I brought along with me an abalone shell . This abalone shell is a biocomposite material that 's 98 percent by mass calcium carbonate and two percent by mass protein . Yet , it 's 3,000 times tougher than its geological counterpart . And a lot of people might use structures like abalone shells , like chalk . I 've been fascinated by how nature makes materials , and there 's a lot of sequence to how they do such an exquisite job . Part of it is that these materials are macroscopic in structure , but they 're formed at the nanoscale . They 're formed at the nanoscale , and they use proteins that are coded by the genetic level that allow them to build these really exquisite structures . So something I think is very fascinating is what if you could give life to non-living structures , like batteries and like solar cells ? What if they had some of the same capabilities that an abalone shell did , in terms of being able to build really exquisite structures at room temperature and room pressure , using non-toxic chemicals and adding no toxic materials back into the environment ? So that 's the vision that I 've been thinking about . And so what if you could grow a battery in a petri dish ? Or , what if you could give genetic information to a battery so that it could actually become better as a function of time , and do so in an environmentally friendly way ?

Samson spared week from death 14 / 01 / 06 A DOG on death row with a taste for men in uniform has been given a reprieve . Magistrates had imposed a death sentence on three-year-old rottweiler Samson after they heard he had attacked a postman and a police officer . They were bitten in separate incidents while calling at the home of owner Mandie Jayne Henderson , in Newton Aycliffe , County Durham . Despite a previous order by South Durham magistrates for Samson to be kept under control after the attack on the postman , he bit the PC on the arm in the back yard of the house , in Booth Walk , last January . The officer , who was calling after a further complaint about the dog , retreated bleeding from puncture wounds . Magistrates imposed the destruction order at a hearing in August , and confirmed their ruling last month . But this week , eight days before he was due to be put down , Ms Henderson appealed against the sentence at Durham Crown Court . Her barrister , James Robinson , said that other than a clash with another dog while being walked by Ms Henderson's former partner , there had been no further incidents since the officer was bitten . Mr Robinson told the court that Samson was muzzled when taken for a walk . He said : "" She will do whatever is necessary to spare this dog . "" She did not believe he had to be kept muzzled when he was at home in the yard , but she can keep him muzzled all the time at home , if necessary . "" Judge Michael Cartlidge , sitting with two magistrates , upheld the appeal , sparing Samson",3.0

By Tom Newton Dunn , Defence Correspondent The Mirror 17 July 2002 TWO Israeli arms companies have been invited to show their wares at a popular British air show next week . Rafael and Elbit Systems will be exhibiting their full range at the Farnborough International Airshow . It is the first time Israeli companies have been invited to Farnborough since the Intifada uprising began in September 2000 . The show is run by the Society of British Aerospace Companies but is supported by the British Government . Trade and Industry Secretary Patricia Hewitt will attend on Monday . But her Department yesterday declined to comment on the ethics of the issue . Labour MP Alice Mahon last night tabled a motion criticising the Government . She said : "" The message we are sending to our Arab friends is that we do n't care what the Israeli government does . "" Earlier this year , the Government refused export licences for Israel if equipment could be used against the Palestinians . But in a U-turn last week Foreign Secretary Jack Straw agreed to export parts for US F16 fighters going to Israel . And on Monday the Mirror revealed the MoD was to spend £ 200million on 5,000 Rafael Spike missiles , which the Israelis have used to target Palestinian militants . </doc>",3.0

North Carolina Harm Reduction Coalition ( NCHRC ) has been able to advocate for syringe decriminalization and the legalization of syringe exchange programs thanks to grants from AIDS United . NCHRC is North Carolina's only comprehensive harm reduction program . NCHRC engages in grassroots advocacy , resource development , coalition building and direct services for those made vulnerable by drug use , sex work , overdose , immigration status , gender , STIs , HIV and hepatitis . In solidarity with law enforcement and Injection Drug Users ( IDUs ) , NCHRC has been advocating for saner syringe access laws . North Carolina has an estimated 25 , 000-50 , 000 IDUs , restrictive syringe access laws and no legal Syringe Exchange Programs ; this has contributed to over 35,000 HIV infections and over 150,000 hepatitis C infections due to syringe and injection equipment sharing . Though NC boasts 5 underground syringe exchange programs spread throughout the state in the Triangle , Winston Salem , Carrboro , Greensboro and Asheville , they can not come close to meeting the population's needs due to legal and financial barriers . Unfortunately for NC , this has led to "" one in three "" law enforcement officers receiving accidental needle-sticks over their careers . In NC , it is illegal to carry syringes or injection equipment to inject drugs , therefore users share equipment and do not inform law enforcement if they are carrying equipment . This leaves law enforcement prone to needlesticks when they perform mandatory pat downs by accidentally touching the syringe tips . Complicating matters , law enforcement are not given needlestick resistant gloves as standard issue due to budget cuts , thus they have no protection from needlesticks .

Well I was born in New York in 1954 , but grew up in Los Angeles . I now live in Santa Barbara , California . As you may have guessed , my real name is n't Christopher Pike . I am very guarded about my real name , as I prefer to keep my identity a secret . My pen name was taken from Star Trek as it was the name of the first captain of the Starship Enterprise and I am a huge fan of any kind of science fiction . Apart from science fiction I love reading books by Stephen King , Tolkien and Ray Bradbury -- Fahrenheit 451 is one of my favourite books , along with Lord of the Rings . My love of books started pretty early on . At school I was very shy and as a result I would often be found absorbed in a book . I see my writing as a way of prolonging my youth ! Before writing my career took off I had various jobs including a house painter , a computer programmer and a factory worker . I left university early to begin my career and starting off writing science fiction , which I loved -- but no one would publish it . I never really set out to write books for teenagers , it just seemed to happen that way . Being a teenager is a very intense time as you 've got so many things going on in your life and I think you feel everything so much more : anger , love , jealousy and loyalty . I have written books for adults but I prefer writing books for children . After hundreds of rejection letters my first books were finally published in 1984",3.0

While School is a great place to learn , play and make friends , unfortunately it 's also a great place for germs to get very well acquainted ... with your family ! Keep Your Kids Healthy This School Year 10 top reasons for the common cold It 's no coincidence that the school year and the common cold season start about the same time . Schools provide an ideal setting for spreading germs , with children indoors and in close contact for much of the day . As infected people sniffle , sneeze , and cough , cold viruses spread through the air and onto skin and surfaces like tables , doorknobs , and stair railings , where they can live for up to two hours . Kids bear the brunt of seasonal illnesses , typically picking up six to 10 colds a year compared with the two to four colds adults get , according to the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases . The Centers for Disease Control chalks up 22 million school absences each year to colds alone . The good news is that kids can greatly reduce their risk of getting or spreading a cold with healthy habits and good hygiene . These include : Washing hands thoroughly Coughing and sneezing into a tissue or sleeve , not into hands Not sharing drinks or food utensils Not rubbing one's nose and eyes Not biting fingernails or chewing on pencils Prevention For The Common Cold Wash your hands ! One of the main ways people catch colds is by rubbing their eyes or nose after touching a person or object with a cold virus . Hand-washing can help ward off the common cold and many other communicable illnesses ; however , most people do n't wash",3.0

Groundbreaking Hair Restoration Procedure : Celebrity FUE Transplant Celebrities must present themselves at their best at all times because of the social pressures associated with fame . Celebrity FUE Hair Transplant , offered by Dr. Parsa Mohebi , is a type of FUE transplant with no need to shave your head , no downtime and no detectability even the first day after the procedure . In this new procedure , only a limited number of grafts are extracted in their natural groupings . This novel procedure was introduced by Dr. Mohebi for patients who do not wish to publicize the appearance of their hair transplant . FUE Transplant , also known as follicular unit extraction , is the process of collecting hair units directly and individually from the patients donor area . The hair units are extracted microscopically and evenly from the donor area after shaving the scalp on the back . Celebrity FUE Transplant is similar to the normal FUE procedure , but the patient does not need to shave the entire back of the head . This outpatient procedure takes approximately 3 to 4 hours and allows the person to maintain his / her natural hair appearance with no noticeable signs of surgery . This procedure is more gradual , because only 500 grafts are transplanted during each session . Celebrity hair loss patients can now enjoy the benefit of a gradual transformation with minimal interruption to their daily lives . </doc>",3.0

Dear Ishmael Please may I thank you for the children's celebration on Wednesday ( ? ) of Week 1 of Spring Harvest this year : the celebration at which you and others prayed for healing for those there .

The amount you need to eat changes as you get older . It also depends on how active you are , if you are still growing or not , and how much you already weigh . The more active you are , the more energy you need from food . The energy food gives you is measured in calories . Hector says : "" If we eat more food than we need to make energy , the extra food turns to fat and this is stored in our bodies . "" Children are much smaller than adults but they are usually very active and still growing . They usually need between 1000 and 2000 calories every day . Adult women need between 2000 and 4000 calories every day and men need between 3000 and 5000 calories , depending on how active they are . Adult bodies are larger than children's so adults need to eat more to produce energy . Older people generally tend to use less energy than other adults . Depending on how active they are , they only need between 1000 and 2000 calories a day . </doc>",3.0

Problems in paying for care Find out what to do if you have problems paying for your care or questions about how much the council should pay . Talk to your council If you need help to pay for the care you need , ask your council's social services if they can help . How much will the council pay ? What happens if the council wo n't pay ? Sometimes councils have reasons for not paying for people's care . They should explain the reasons to you . At other times , they may not be following government rules . For example , you could be told that you are eligible for financial help , only to be then told that the council does not have enough money to pay for you , or you could be asked to join a waiting list . If this happens , or if there are any others ways you feel that the decision is not fair , you do have the right to question the decision .

Distr . 19 September 2003 Original : ENGLISH GENDER ISSUES IN ICT STATISTICS AND INDICATORS , Keynote address Ms. Nancy J. Hafkin , Knowledge Working ( USA ) Introduction Why gender statistics ? The basic purpose of this workshop is to underline the importance of bringing ICT data into the realm of official statistics so that current global gaps in the data can be identified and closed . This paper maintains that one of the most important data gaps is in the area of gender and ICT statistics and indicators , which can be closed by the identification and collection of sex-disaggregated data and gender-specific indicators . By its very name , the World Summit on the Information Society emphasizes the societal over the technological aspects of ICT . In order to have a clear picture of the impact of ICT on society , it is necessary to see whether and how ICT impact men and women differently . Without this data , the situation of a majority of the world's people vis-à-vis ICT may be overlooked . There is a paucity of sex-disaggregated information on the Information Society . This reflects the more general dearth of information on women's activities across all sectors that has led to a lack of understanding of the ' different world's men and women live in ' - in terms of access to education and work , health , personal security and leisure time ( United Nations , 1996 : xvii ) . The collection and analysis of information on the differential impact of ICT on men and women is a necessary prerequisite to the achievement of a globally equitable Information Society .

Merkel in China NEW DELHI – German Chancellor Angela Merkel's second visit to China in a year comes against the backdrop of dire forecasts of a difficult September for the eurozone . Mindful of such concerns and persistent pessimism in global financial markets , Merkel is now taking bold political initiatives at home and overseas . Indeed , her China trip should be seen as an effort to assert leadership across the eurozone . At home , Merkel recently sent out a clear message to her critics that Germany must pay a price for eurozone leadership . She cautioned her colleagues against loose talk about a "" Grexit "" – Greece's exit from the eurozone – and assured visiting Greek Prime Minister Antonis Samaras that Germany remained committed to his country's membership of the eurozone . While it required courage to take such a tough stance , doing so helped to bolster her position at home and throughout the eurozone . There is now no doubt that Merkel is willing to commit Germany to the cause of preserving both the European Union and the eurozone , and that she will work to achieve that goal . If she succeeds , she will emerge as the first great European leader of the twenty-first century . This stance suggests that Merkel appreciates the essence of the argument that François Heisbourg , the chairman of the council of the International Institute for Strategic Studies ( IISS ) , advanced in a [ 179 ] recent essay : a federal arrangement does not fall apart because of problems at the periphery but because of "" failure at the heart of the system .

Chocolate University Online Free Chocolate Information 21 things you must know about chocolate ! Chocolate is made from the fruit of the cacao tree . Cacao pods contain nibs that are crushed to make unsweetened chocolate . When the cacao nibs are crushed , there are fats and solids remaining . The fats are called cocoa butter . The solids are ground into cocoa powder . Chocolate bars may have "" % Cacao "" or "" % Cocoa "" printed on the label . This percentage refers to the total content of the cacao ( or cocoa ) solids . White Chocolate does not contain cocoa solids but can be called chocolate by U.S. FDA standards . It must contain cocoa butter .

Exchange Rate Disorder NEW YORK – Two troubling features of the ongoing economic recovery are the depressed nature of world trade and the early revival of international global payment imbalances . Estimates by the International Monetary Fund and the United Nations indicate that the volume of international trade in 2010 will still be 7 % to 8 % below its 2008 peak , while many or most countries , including industrial nations , are seeking to boost their current accounts . Indeed , if we believe the IMF's projections , the world economy 's accumulated current-account surpluses would increase by almost $ 1 trillion between 2009 and 2012 ! This is , of course , impossible , as surpluses and deficits must be in balance for the world economy as a whole . It simply reflects the recessionary ( or deflationary ) force of weak global demand hanging over the world economy . Under these conditions , export-led growth by major economies is a threat to the world economy . This is true for China , Germany ( as French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde has consistently reminded her neighbor ) , Japan , and the United States . Countries running surpluses must adopt expansionary policies and appreciate their currencies . More broadly , to the extent that major emerging-market countries will continue to lead the global recovery , they should reduce their current-account surpluses or even generate deficits to help , through increased imports , spread the benefits of their growth worldwide . But , while that implies that emerging-market currencies must strengthen , disorderly appreciations would do more harm than good . To use an American saying , it might mean throwing out the baby ( economic growth ) with the bathwater ( exchange rate appreciation ) . Consider",3.0

Returning Image File Information When accessing formatted image data ( not contained in a binary file ) , there are a number of ways to get information about the data characteristics . The most flexible is the QUERY_IMAGE routine , which returns a structure that includes the number of image channels , pixel data type and palette information . If you need specific information from a formatted image file , you can use the QUERY * routine specifically designed for images of that format . Note You can also use the SIZE function to quickly return the size of an image array . See Using SIZE to Return Image Dimensions for details . Using the QUERY_IMAGE Info Structure Common image file formats contain standardized header information that can be queried . IDL provides the QUERY_IMAGE function to return valuable information about images stored in supported image file formats . For example , using the QUERY_IMAGE function , you can return information about the mineral . png file in the examples / data directory . First , access the file . Then use the QUERY_IMAGE function to return information about the file : file = FILEPATH ( ' mineral . png ' , $ SUBDIRECTORY = [ ' examples ' , ' data ' ] ) queryStatus = QUERY_IMAGE ( file , info ) To determine the success of the QUERY_IMAGE function , print the value of the query variable : PRINT , ' Status = ' , queryStatus IDL prints queryStatus = 1 If queryStatus is zero , the file can not be accessed with IDL . If queryStatus is one , the file can be accessed . Because the query was successful , the info variable is now an IDL structure containing image parameters . The tags associated with",3.0

China's Cyber-Warriors NEW DELHI – The world now accepts that protecting our atmosphere , hydrosphere , lithosphere , and biosphere – the "" global commons "" – is the responsibility of all countries . The same norm must apply to cyberspace , which is critical to our everyday life , economic well-being , and security . At a time when cyber attacks are increasing worldwide , US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was right to declare that an attack on one nation's computer networks "" can be an attack on all . "" Indeed , the attacks are a reminder that , as a new part of the global commons , cyberspace already has come under threat . Cyberspace must be treated , along with outer space , international waters , and international airspace , as property held in common for the good of all . And , like ocean piracy and airplane hijacking , cyber-crime can not be allowed to go unpunished if we are to safeguard our common assets and collective interests . Naming China among a handful of countries that have stepped up Internet censorship , Clinton warned that "" a new information curtain is descending across much of the world . "" Her statement , with its allusion to the Cold War-era Iron Curtain , amounted to an implicit admission that the central assumption guiding US policy on China since the 1990's – that assisting China's economic rise would usher in greater political openness there – has gone awry . The strategy of using market forces and the Internet to open up a closed political system simply is not working . Indeed , the more economic power China has accumulated , the more adept it has become in extending censorship to cyberspace . If anything ,",3.0

Solomon revealed this source more than 3,000 years ago , and modern science has now confirmed it ! The Key to Healing is to Remove the One Source of Illness and Disease Dr. Ben Johnson's personal story below is just one of the thousands of stories of healing from people who have used The Healing Codes . In 2003 , Dr. Ben Johnson visited an orthopedic surgeon to discuss symptoms of fatigue and muscle spasms he had been experiencing for over a year . The diagnosis was something he never expected ... ALS ( more commonly known as "" Lou Gehrig's Disease "" ) . He then went to another doctor for a second opinion , but the diagnosis was the same . As a medical doctor , Ben knew his prognosis was grim . Eighty percent of people with ALS die within 5 years of developing symptoms , and he had been experiencing symptoms for over a year . Shortly after his diagnosis , Ben learned of Dr. Alex Loyd's new work known as The Healing Codes . Ben was intrigued by the amazing stories of healing being experienced by Dr. Loyd's patients , so he decided to personally investigate the science and philosophy of The Healing Codes . He came away convinced that there really was something remarkable in Dr. Loyd's new work , and began practicing The Healing Codes himself . After only three months of practicing The Healing Codes , Ben could tell that he was no longer experiencing the symptoms of ALS . He returned to the surgeon who had first diagnosed him with ALS , and the tests showed that the disease was 100 % gone . Ben has remained symptom free for over 6 years now !

God Sends Sunday was the last book of the Harlem Renaissance . It was published in 1931 by one of New York's major publishers . It appeared in bookstores more than a decade after the start of the concentrated upsurge in artistic creation by African Americans , centered in Harlem , that came to be known as the Harlem Renaissance . The book's author was a relative latecomer to Harlem : Arna Bontemps moved there in 1924 , after graduating from college in California . He began teaching at the Harlem Academy , and he put himself into the middle of Harlem's artistic tumult through friendships with other writers and a string of prizes that he won for his poetry in 1926 and 1927 . But the stock market collapsed in late 1929 , and the economic disorder that evolved into the Great Depression began to spread . Bontemps continued teaching while he was writing what would become God Sends Sunday . Harcourt , Brace agreed to publish the book in 1931 , and it received generally positive reviews . Yet larger forces buffeted Bontemps and those around him . As he wrote , drily , in 1968 : Within weeks after the publication of my first book , as it happened , I had been caught up in a quaint and poignant disorder that failed to attract wide attention . It was one of the side effects of the crash that brought on the Depression , and it brought instant havoc to the Harlem Renaissance of the twenties . I was one of the hopeful young people displaced , so to speak . The jobs we had counted on to keep us alive and writing in New York vanished , as some observed , quicker than a cat could",3.0

Preventing violence against women "" During her lifetime one out of two women will be beaten by a man who loves her ! "" Leonore Loeb Adler Education has always played an integral part in the lives of every single child in the country and in the world . This is not surprising as it is education that gives children the knowledge to think , evaluate and be able to identify a problem and solve it . Social skills , critical thinking skills , problem solving skills , empathy training – all of these are obtained through the process of education and are an essential part of a becoming a multi-sided developed personality . One of the major characteristics of such a personality is the ability to solve all the conflicts without any aggression and especially without violence . The process of socialization of children through age appropriate K-12 in all the skills listed above put school-boys in the group that are less likely to be violent to women and minimize the values and beliefs that boys form according to their male entitlement . As children learn everything connected with aggression and violence and how to deal with it they become "" armed "" and do not get lost in situations that require active actions in order to recognize or respond to any type of violence against women be it a physical , verbal , sexual , or emotional type of abuse . Boys acquire the ability to react and recognize violence against women owing to the education and knowledge they get they and it is a strong presupposition to not being aggressive . Nevertheless school is just one of the factors influencing boys and the other one is family . If the family's interpersonal relations are characterized by high",3.0

This domain identifies a group of enzymes belongs to the GHMP kinase domain superfamily in the archaea . GHMP kinases are a unique class of ATP-dependent enzymes ( the abbreviation of which refers to the original members : galactokinase , homoserine kinase , mevalonate kinase , and phosphomevalonate kinase ) [ 1 ] . Enzymes belonging to this superfamily contain three well-conserved motifs , the second of which has the typical sequence Pro-X-X-X-Gly-Leu-X-Ser-Ser-Ala and is involved in ATP binding [ 2 ] . The phosphate binding loop in GHMP kinases is distinct from the classical P-loops found in many ATP / GTP binding proteins . The bound ADP molecule adopts a rare syn conformation and is in the opposite orientation from those bound to the P-loop-containing proteins [ 2 ] . GHMP kinases display a distinctly bilobal appearance with their N-terminal subdomains dominated by a mixed beta-sheet flanked on one side by alpha-helices and their C-terminal subdomains containing a four stranded anti-parallel beta-sheet [ 3 , 2 , 4 , 5 ] . There are currently no experimental data for members of this family , and their exact biochemical and biological functions are not known yet . </doc>",3.0

If a cracker is trying to break into the account by trying to guess the password , a changed password makes it difficult for the attacker . If an account has already been breached , the password expiration will help prevent or at least raise suspicions that there is an issue . With a good enterprise password management tool , such as Avatier's Password Station , the real user will get notifications about needing to change their password before it is expired which the cracker may never see . Finally , if the account has been breached and the cracker changes the password , the user may notice they ca n't get into their account anymore and this may lead to an investigation . Those are all good and valuable benefits . However , on the other side are a few major problems : Many users will start using passwords like "" howdy1 "" . Then , when the expiration hits , they just change it to "" howdy2 "" . This means that if the password is ever cracked , it is likely the cracker will be able to guess future passwords as well . Other users will start writing down their passwords because they ca n't remember them anymore . The shorter the password expiration , the greater the number of Help Desk calls related to forgotten passwords will be . So what can be done to get the benefits of an enterprise password manager while minimizing the problems ? First , the number of different passwords in the organization needs to be considered . A company with one Windows domain is going to have fewer issues than a company with a mix of Windows , ERP , Databases , Unix , Mainframe , and so on .",3.0

Chapter 18 The next day he did not leave the house , and , indeed , spent most of the time in his own room , sick with a wild terror of dying , and yet indifferent to life itself . The consciousness of being hunted , snared , tracked down , had begun to dominate him . If the tapestry did but tremble in the wind , he shook . The dead leaves that were blown against the leaded panes seemed to him like his own wasted resolutions and wild regrets . When he closed his eyes , he saw again the sailor's face peering through the mist-stained glass , and horror seemed once more to lay its hand upon his heart . But perhaps it had been only his fancy that had called vengeance out of the night and set the hideous shapes of punishment before him . Actual life was chaos , but there was something terribly logical in the imagination . It was the imagination that set remorse to dog the feet of sin . It was the imagination that made each crime bear its misshapen brood . In the common world of fact the wicked were not punished , nor the good rewarded . Success was given to the strong , failure thrust upon the weak . That was all . Besides , had any stranger been prowling round the house , he would have been seen by the servants or the keepers . Had any foot-marks been found on the flower-beds , the gardeners would have reported it . Yes , it had been merely fancy . Sibyl Vane's brother had not come back to kill him .

If you 've been keeping up with news surrounding Oracle , you may be aware that a number of hacker attacks have been made through their Java programming language . This raised concerns of several digital security firms worldwide . In an effort to prevent further attacks , Oracle has released a Java patch to fix the flaw being exploited by hackers . To learn more about this recent patch and whether or not it worked , keep reading . Did The Patch Work ? Apparently , researchers are saying the patch did in fact fix two errors that were being exploited by hackers to cause malicious attacks . With that said , the Java 7 patch also opened up several other vulnerabilities . I guess you could compare Oracle's recent patch to a "" double-edged sword "" in the sense that it fixed one problem but opened up another . Because Oracle was able to release the Java 7 patch so quickly , analysts say they had patch ready for months . So , if Oracle had the patch ready , why did n't they release it ? Well , patches need to be ran through a quality assurance team to ensure they work and do n't break other parts of the system , and it 's likely that Oracle was doing this for their Java 7 patch . It 's unclear as to when Oracle will release another patch aimed at fixing the current vulnerabilities opened up by their most recent Java 7 patch . However , security",3.0

This paper deals with the paradox of analysis in general , and in particular its application to Lewis' attempt to give a reductive analysis of modality in terms of worlds . Lewis thinks his theory of modal realism involves no modal primitive , this has been challenged by Bill Lycan . Modal realism asserts that something is possible if and only if it is true at some world . Lycan's challenge to Lewis is that if realism is to be correct then the right hand side of this biconditional must not quantify over any world at which an impossibility is true . But , says Lycan , we can ensure that this is the case only if the domain of quantification is said to be not just worlds but possible worlds . Thus realism has a modal primitive after all , the notion of a possible world . I will argue that Lycan's objections to Lewis do not work , but that his objections suggest a related worry which poses a problem for a realist epistemology . Lycan claims that Lewis can only assert the modal truth scheme PW - à p "" $ w ( Tpw ) - if he admits a modal primitive into his theory . I claim that it is Lewis' assertion of PW that lets him avoid Lycan's point . I will argue that in general if one gives an analysis of F in terms of Y then one can legitimately and without circularity appeal to that analysis in order to defend the truth of the biconditional F x "" Y x . However , any analysis may be judged in part by how it coheres with our pre-theoretic beliefs . If our analysis tells us that too many or too little of what we",3.0

Letter dated 14 May 2002 from the Permanent Representative of Cuba to the United Nations addressed to the Secretary-General On 6 May 2002 the Under Secretary of State for Arms Control and International Security of the United States of America delivered a speech to the ultra-conservative Heritage Foundation in which he made odious accusations against Cuba , claiming that the country was involved in the development of biological weapons research and development programmes . These slanderous allegations by Mr. John Bolton were met with an adequate and timely response from the Government of the Republic of Cuba in a statement issued by President Fidel Castro Ruz on 10 May 2002 , a copy of which I have the honour to transmit herewith ( see annex ) .

The Secret Life of Oscar Wilde , by Neil McKenna reviewed by Jim Herrick This new biography could well be subtitled "" the wild , wild sex of Oscar "" ; . It transforms our knowledge of Wilde by its detailed account of his engagement with the Victorian homosexual underworld . Richard Ellmann , whose biography ( 1987 ) is reckoned a classic , provides an authoritative and sympathetic portrait of the great writer ; but for the full picture McKenna ( a former editor of the Pink Paper ) is the biographer to read . Although the Ellmann biography deserves respect it can be wrong – ; that Wilde contracted syphilis seems unlikely , that he eschewed anal intercourse seems wrong . McKenna attempts to correct the view ( to which Ellmann subscribes ) that Wilde's final years in Paris were unutterably miserable ; but alcoholism , poverty and quarrels with Bosie do not sound like bliss , even if some casual sex went some way to redeeming it . Unlike Bosie , who was busy buggering boys at Winchester public school , Wilde came late to homosexuality . The emotions preceded the actions – ; although his later hymns to neoplatonic love were undercut by his love of rough trade whether in Piccadilly or Algiers . His marriage came at a time when he was reaching for homosexual contacts , the classic attempt to deny the real feelings for the conventional alliance , a mistake that gay men still make today . Constance , his wife , was constant and gave him two sons , but the relationship was strained and they virtually separated as he lived a life of lust in hotels . He became a great talker and a great writer . His first big success",3.0

raditionally , biology research begins with a hypothesis . A biologist then collects experimental data and analyzes them to support or disprove the hypothesis . However , information technology is changing this sequence of events . Today , large-scale exploratory experiments are gathering as much data as possible ; for example , the Human Genome Project is enumerating the three billion amino acids in the human genetic blueprint . So now when a biologist forms a hypothesis , the data may already be in such a collection , just a computer search away . An NPACI alpha project led by Russ Altman of Stanford University is developing new tools and techniques to extract insights from growing biology data collections . Alongside these collections , a new discipline has emerged , called bioinformatics . Bioinformatics researchers develop and apply computing tools to extract the secrets of the life and death of organisms from the genetic blueprints and molecular structures stored in digital collections . However , while large-scale activities are amassing vast quantities of data , the techniques for routinely analyzing these collections have not kept pace . "" Because of activities like the Human Genome Project , exploratory data collection has come to be seen as more cost effective , "" said Altman , associate professor of medicine in the section on Medical Informatics at Stanford University Medical Center and leader of NPACI's Molecular Science thrust area . "" The collectors do not necessarily know why they are collecting . They figure that out later . This project will develop the infrastructure that will allow biologists to answer questions using these data collections . "" For example , a biologist might hypothesize that a protein with certain features--such as a particular sequence or structure--must exist to carry out some task",3.0

"" You ca n't change other people ; you can only change yourself "" is one of those lessons I 've had to learn over and over again . And then sometimes I forget it and have to learn it again . You do n't get very far in a family business , for example , without learning this lesson . I am very thankful that my siblings and I learned it early and often . Think about a sibling for a minute . Can you change even one of his or her possibly annoying behaviors ? No. You ca n't . Siblings are who they are , and you can only change your own reaction , response , and behavior . Some people do this by moving to other states , or even countries . Some people do this by never speaking to their siblings again . But in a family business that 's committed to staying a family business , you learn to change yourself . It does work ! Of course this truth applies to other relationships , as well . Sometimes no amount of effort to influence can create the change you want to see . In an intimate relationship , that can be heartbreaking . Whether it 's something big or something little ( is anything really "" little "" in a relationship ? ) , it 's the same : All you can do is change your own reaction , response , and behavior . If you truly , genuinely express your heart and someone does n't respond the way you 'd like him or her to , and you try something different and it still does n't work , you have to face the honest truth that the only thing you can change",3.0

An Israeli helicopter missile strike has killed a Palestinian militant in his car in Gaza City . Witnesses say six other Palestinians were wounded in the blast Sunday . The dead militant , Khalid Abu Salima , was a member of the military wing of Hamas , the Ezzedin al-Qassam Brigades . Israeli military officials say he played a role in the manufacture of improvised rockets used in attacks on Israelis . Earlier Sunday , Israeli troops killed a Palestinian man near the Karni crossing just inside the Gaza Strip .

The environment has four major components : the air , the land , the water and the living organisms which inhabit it . Scientists have given special names for each by creating words based on Greek vocabulary . The first component of the environment is called the atmosphere . The atmosphere contains gases such as nitrogen , oxygen and a small amount of carbon dioxide . The next category of the environment is where all the water is found . It is called the hydrosphere . Bodies of water such as lakes , streams and the oceans form the hydrosphere . The lithosphere is the rock crust of the Earth . The entire planet is covered by the lithosphere , even though most of it has a layer of water on top called the oceans . The last category of the environment is what makes the Earth unique : the biosphere . The biosphere is where all life is found . The Atmosphere Although it is almost entirely invisible , the atmosphere is the easiest part of the Earth's environment to study . Most of the hydrosphere and the lithosphere are difficult to access and remain largely unexplored . The atmosphere , however , has very few mysteries . Just about every cubic metre of it has been observed by scientists or satellites .

Stars kick off movie awards season at Hollywood Film Awards Mel Gibson , Natalie Portman and Tom Hanks are among the stars who were honoured at the Hollywood Film Awards . Gibson won best director for World War II drama Hacksaw Ridge , a sign he has been accepted by the industry a decade after an infamous anti-Semitic rant . Portman won best actress for Jackie , in which she portrays Jacqueline Kennedy after John F Kennedy's assassination . The event styles itself as the start of the awards season , but is regarded with scepticism by some industry observers . Winners were announced in advance with no nominations . Many of the winning films have not yet been released and an anonymous panel chooses the recipients . But that did not stop an A-list crowd turning up to the ceremony , which was compered by TV host James Corden - although he did joke at one point that they were "" fake awards "" .

The Coalition is comprised primarily of , but not limited to , prepaid and pre-subscribed international long distance service providers . These providers voluntarily and anonymously joined forces in an effort to remedy certain discriminatory and inequitable issues associated with the Universal Service Administrative Corporation's ( "" USAC "" ) administration of the FCC's Universal Service Fund ( "" USF "" ) contribution requirements . The Petition requests Commission action on two issues affecting International Telecommunications Companies ( "" ITCs "" ) . First , the Coalition proposed a solution to discriminatory pass-through charges imposed upon "" de minimis "" resale carriers . The USF is a federal program created to assist in national diffusion of telecommunications services . Unless exempted , all telecommunications carriers must contribute a portion of their interstate and international end-user revenues to the USF . Currently , the FCC's rules exempt "" de minimis "" providers , those whose contribution to universal service does not exceed $ 10 , 000 per year , from direct USF fees . However , because the FCC treats these non-contributors as end-users , and allows underlying carriers to pass USF fees through to their end-user customers , de minimis carriers ultimately bear a significant USF burden . In fact , a provider's pass-through burden under the current system often exceeds the burden it would otherwise face as a direct contributor . The FCC also limits the burden on carriers whose interstate revenues amount to less than 12 % of their combined international and interstate end-user revenues . However , a qualifying international carrier that is also a de minimis provider is especially at risk for high pass-through fees . While the FCC only requires direct payment on the interstate portion of a qualifying carrier's revenue , the underlying carrier",3.0

CPD guidance A new emphasis has been placed on Continuing Professional Development ( CPD ) for all teachers in Scotland . Although CPD is now a statutory element of a teacher's working life , research by the GTCS identified a demand from teachers for further advice and guidance . Here we introduce some of the guidance GTCS can provide to help teachers with CPD . Your guide to everything CPD GTCS has launched guidance for teachers looking to engage effectively in the process of CPD . As many teachers can testify , effective CPD whilst seeking to keep your professional practice up-to-date and stimulating , also encourages you to be an inspired teacher who will in turn inspire learners . GTCS has responded to calls for support by developing a set of CPD guidelines , the process of doing so being informed throughout by teachers' knowledge and experiences as revealed in GTCS research . GTCS also recently launched the upgraded version of its Standard for Full Registration ( SFR ) which describes the qualities and capabilities that all registered teachers in Scotland are required to demonstrate in their professional practice . A significant addition to the start of this document is the statement that the SFR is ' a baseline professional standard that applies to all teachers throughout their career ' . Hence , it is no coincidence that the new CPD guidelines should be issued at this time . If all teachers are to maintain and enhance their professional practice in order to work at , or above , the requirements of the SFR , then they will need to be making effective use of their CPD in order to do that . To this end , the new CPD guidelines not only make explicit the professional benefits of",3.0

The Juno spacecraft arrives at Jupiter on July 4 , 2016 , after a journey of nearly five years and 2.7 billion km ( 1 . 7 billion miles ) . It will be the first space probe to orbit Jupiter since Galileo plunged into that planet's atmosphere in 2003 . NASA / JPL-Caltech Jupiter is the most-massive planet in the solar system , and because it is so large , it retained all of the gas it was born with . Nothing could escape its gravitation by seeping into space , like the hydrogen in Earth's atmosphere . By studying the composition of Jupiter , Juno will be able to identify the gas that the planet formed with 4.5 billion years ago and thus maybe learn how Jupiter came to be . NASA / JPL The Great Red Spot is a storm larger than Earth ( about 16,500 km wide ) that has been swirling since at least the 1830s and maybe even since the mid-17th century . Although it 's been observed for centuries , almost nothing is known about it . What is powering it ? Why has it lasted for hundreds of years ? Juno will get a very close view of the spot , from just 4,600 km ( 3 , 000 miles ) away , which may clear up its mysteries . Not much is known about the core of Jupiter , or even if it really has one at all .

Silas drew near the man on tiptoe . He lay partly on his back , partly on his side , and his right forearm concealed his face from recognition . Suddenly , while the American was still bending over him , the sleeper removed his arm and opened his eyes , and Silas found himself once more face to face with the loiterer of Box Court . "" Good-night , sir , "" said the man , pleasantly . But Silas was too profoundly moved to find an answer , and regained his room in silence . Towards morning , worn out by apprehension , he fell asleep on his chair , with his head forward on the trunk .

US election 2016 : Hour-by-hour guide to the night A clock sits outside of Trump Tower Is Trump's time up ?

US election on the BBC - How to keep up Americans go to the polls on 8 November to elect the 45th US president . Here 's what to watch out for as election night unfolds . All 50 states and Washington DC will go to the polls across six different time zones on election day . But it 's not just winning the popular vote that counts . The US's complicated system is a race to secure 270 out of the 538 votes in the electoral college . Most of the US will have to wait for polling stations to close - typically between 19 : 00 EST ( 24 : 00 GMT ) and 20 : 00 EST ( 01 : 00 GMT ) - for state projections , which are based on exit polls . However , one village , Dixville Notch in New Hampshire - the UK's Sunderland of America - has a tradition of middle-of-the-night voting and will have declared its result before the polls even open , at 00 : 01 EST ( 05 : 01 GMT ) . Here 's what 's likely to happen when , based on when polls close , with the caveat that all times are subject to change if it 's too close to call . As for the final result ?

Luxury living is child's play The great thing about the Azia Beach Hotel in Cyprus is that it 's five-star but not formal . So take the baby and relax , says Lena Corner Published : 23 July 2006 It 's often easier to stay at home than drag a child of an awkward age away on holiday . Fifteen-month-old Ronnie is at that in-between stage where he 's just learnt to walk and is terribly excited by his new skill but also frighteningly unsteady . A younger baby is more portable because it will sit in its pram and a toddler you can leave to run off steam . Ronnie does n ' t quite do either . So when our taxi finally swept into the forecourt of the Azia Beach Hotel and Spa , after a fairly fraught four-hour flight , the relief was immense . We checked into our room and popped Ronnie in his cot just in time to crack open a couple of ice-cold Keo beers and catch a blistering red sunset over the Mediterranean from the comfort of the hot tub on our balcony . The great thing about the Azia is that it does five-star without being formal or turgid . Its brochure is emblazoned with that old "" barefoot glamour "" cliché , but here it really works . This is the kind of place where a noisy baby at the dinner table gets serenaded by a musician rather than banished to its room . Although it 's a fairly average resort set-up , with a pool complex at the centre , a couple of restaurants , gym , tennis courts etc , last year a facelift - the addition of a luxurious Elemis spa along with plenty of muted earthy tones",3.0

C-evo Contents C-evo ( a.k.a. Civilization-evolution ) is a free-to-play game similar to Civilization II . The game was written in the Delphi programming language , with the main programming done by Steffen Gerlach . The source code is in the public domain , but the graphics are freeware . A successful player manages to find a balance among these choices . The game starts with the development of the wheel , and ends when the first player has successfully constructed the first off-planet spaceship headed out into the Solar System . As the game progresses , the player finds that the building of factories , for example , leads to increased pollution , which must be cleaned up and could be eliminated through development of cleaner technologies . At all stages , cities that grow larger than size 4 have reduced productivity because of unrest until suitable buildings or police are in place to keep the populace under control . Examining a city screen selected from the cities menu at an advanced stage of the game In addition to the standard AI that comes with C-Evo , a number of different AI's ( programs that play C-Evo ) with different strategies are available for C-Evo ; most of the following links are direct links to the zipped files to download : As with the commercial and the other free civ games , there are a variety of strategies possible , though the ultimate launch of a spaceship is the only way of officially winning . The game goes through several somewhat distinct phases , based on the advances a player has researched : Given that the AIs are supposed to operate in a range of map sizes and unknown environments ( sea / land , hostile / friendly opponents",3.0

Tackling human organ donation dilemma By Andy Dixon Published : 29 August , 2006 IT is not easy to talk about your death or the death of those you love . However , by discussing organ donation it could potentially save someone's life . Thousands of Scots are on the waiting list and hundreds die whilst waiting for a crucial organ transplant . The public in Inverness have the chance to save lives when the Scottish Executive's organ donation road show kicks-off at Eastgate shopping centre tomorrow . It is part of a nationwide campaign to encourage more people to sign-up to the Organ Donor Register ( ODR ) . There are over 13.5 million people on the register , a confidential , computerised database used to help establish those who want to donate organs . Shoppers will be given the chance to sign-up on the spot with Scottish Executive representatives on hand to explain the importance of organ donations . The road show coincides with the launch of new legislation coming into effect on Friday . Under the Human Tissue ( Scotland ) Act 2006 , the wishes of people who choose to be considered as organ donors in the event of their death will be respected . Donald Cadzow ( 69 ) is a haemo-dialysis patient at Raigmore Hospital on the transplant waiting list for almost three years . Mr Cadzow , who suffers from total renal failure , attends the hospital three days a week and does not have any dialysis at home . "" It 's a condition that does n ' t get better so I accept it , "" he said . "" I have had to build my life around it . "" The retired Caithness farmer , who now lives just outside",3.0

In optics , his discovery of the composition of white light integrated the phenomena of colours into the science of light and laid the foundation for modern physical optics . In mechanics , his three laws of motion , the basic principles of modern physics , resulted in the formulation of the law of universal gravitation . In mathematics , he was the original discoverer of the infinitesimal calculus .

Should Europe Regulate Sovereign Wealth Funds ? WIESBADEN – State-controlled investments from overseas – so-called sovereign wealth funds ( SWFs ) – are now the subject of intense debate . The United States and France have made their fears known . In Germany , too , the debate centers on SWFs ' political and economic significance for the country's future . The problem has been exacerbated by the growing wealth of a number of countries , some of them formerly run by socialist or communist regimes . China , Russia , India , and the Gulf States have integrated their wealth into the global economy , to the immense benefit of world trade . The openness of Germany's markets makes them especially attractive to global trade . This openness will not change , yet there are some who now call for new safety fences – in other words , for protection . For example , Russian investors are interested in taking a massive share in the German-French aerospace company EADS , which is already 5 % - owned by a Russian bank . For many , this proposal has underscored a change in investors' behavior . But what , exactly , has changed ? SWFs have been around for years . Among the first countries to invest their considerable state-owned funds were Kuwait , the United Arab Emirates , Norway , and Singapore . They invested , and still invest , their budgetary surpluses worldwide in government bonds and state-owned enterprises . Industrialized countries like the US and Japan also have so-called "" reserve funds . "" Some of these funds are huge . In the UAE , the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority has estimated capital assets of $ 875 billion , making it probably the world's largest state-owned investment",3.0

Behind the door hung a cloak with a small collar , a bridle , and a black leather cap , and on the floor , in a corner , were a pair of leggings , still covered with dry mud . On the right was the one apartment , that was both dining and sitting room . A canary yellow paper , relieved at the top by a garland of pale flowers , was puckered everywhere over the badly stretched canvas ; white calico curtains with a red border hung crossways at the length of the window ; and on the narrow mantelpiece a clock with a head of Hippocrates shone resplendent between two plate candlesticks under oval shades .

Ideo : Why Would You Trade Away Your Online Privacy ? 6 Case Studies Personalized services have to offer value discreetly , to get people to share useful information . Most people are still careful to protect their personal information , but more and more of us are choosing to store our most intimate details online : financial information , health records , personal preferences , and even our schedules and location . This is not because we are more trusting , but because sharing information unlocks access to personalized services that support us in meaningful ways . Services such as Flickr , Facebook , and Mint have created platforms to collect personal information and , in turn , have built value around their customers' willingness to provide it . Netflix asks for direct input in exchange for personal recommendations , but the Toyota Prius works in the background , unobtrusively capturing our driving behavior and playing it back to us . Building on the power of information , these services can transform unintended consequences into intentional change . As people share more , their expectations are evolving from archiving services to personalized services that adapt to them , and even anticipatory services that nudge them in positive ways . This has resulted in services that capture people's history , filter their information , and turn it into tailored recommendations , options , alerts , and connections . 1 .

Procedures Are Pertinent Understanding types of repair information offered by OEMs , and where to find them , improves your repair plans for smoother workflow . Andrew Johnson iStock Auto manufacturer information is available for nearly every step of the repair process : disassembly , body and structural work , refinish , and post-repair quality assurance . Repairers must constantly refer to them for every procedure on every car because designs are changing faster than technicians can be trained . There are an estimated 242 vehicle types that will be re-engineered , redesigned , or introduced as brand-new models over the next three years , says Bill Stage , senior director of development for I-CAR . And those changes are driving updates in required methods for panel attachment , welding , equipment , tools , materials and diagnosis . With so much repair information available , reliance on your memory just does n't cut it these days . So habitual reference to OEM resources are critical for quality , accurate and efficient work to be produced at your facility daily . The Problem Failure to refer to OEM processes is a trend that 's surprisingly common throughout the country , Stage says . Some technicians do n't have time to search for the information , some do n't know where to look , some do n't know what types are available , and others simply do n't know the information even exists . Without the information , Stage says technicians tend to make repair decisions based on guesses , past experience or memory . They start cutting , heating , welding and installing components to try to repair things , but they 're not always accurate . Vehicle updates are made so frequently that many of the processes technicians knew",3.0

Noise figure ( NF ) and noise factor ( F ) are measures of degradation of the signal-to-noise ratio ( SNR ) , caused by components in a radio-frequency ( RF ) signal chain . It is a number by which the performance of an amplifier or a radio receiver can be specified , with lower values indicating better performance . The noise factor is defined as the ratio of the output noise power of a device to the portion thereof attributable to thermal noise in the input termination at standard noise temperature T 0 ( usually 290 K ) . The noise factor is thus the ratio of actual output noise to that which would remain if the device itself did not introduce noise , or the ratio of input SNR to output SNR . The noise figure is simply the noise factor expressed in decibels ( dB ) . The noise figure is the difference in decibels ( dB ) between the noise output of the actual receiver to the noise output of an "" ideal "" receiver with the same overall gain and bandwidth when the receivers are connected to matched sources at the standard noise temperature T 0 ( usually 290 K ) . The noise power from a simple load is equal to kTB , where k is Boltzmann's constant , T is the absolute temperature of the load ( for example a resistor ) , and B is the measurement bandwidth . This makes the noise figure a useful figure of merit for terrestrial systems , where the antenna effective temperature is usually near the standard 290 K. In this case , one receiver with a noise figure , say 2 dB better than another , will have an output signal to noise ratio",3.0

Drama – Dramatic activities such as skits , recitations , puppet shows and simple storytelling can let a child concentrate on being a different character for a short time . Put a costume on them and watch how quickly they start getting into character . However , it may take direction from you to keep them focused and enjoying the event . Costumes need not be elaborate to let a child be another character . It need only be representational . A single feather in a headband , a necktie , a hat , sunglasses , scrubs or even just a sign or patch fastened to clothing is enough to let a child jump into another role . Let the child use his or her imagination to help find costume pieces as part of the dramatic play process . And do n't restrict them to the costume box . Colanders make great space helmets .

The primary characteristic of Compulsive Skin Picking ( CSP ) is the repetitive picking at one's own skin to the extent of causing bleeding or damage to the skin to relieve anxiety or urges . Skin-picking is often preceded by a strong itch or urge , which the sufferer believes can only be relieved by picking . Then , of course , a feeling of depression or hopelessness follows when the damage caused by the picking is realised . Paradoxically a kind of compulsive perfectionism may convince the sufferer at the time that picking is a necessary means to achieving a clear complexion . In this way a vicious circle arises that is hard to break . Thus CSP may be seen to have obsessive-compulsive aspects that are similar to OCD , Body Dysmorphic Disorder ( BDD ) and trichotillomania . In fact research has shown that around a quarter of those diagnosed with OCD or BDD also have CSP . CSP is thus sometimes described as an Obsessive Compulsive Spectrum Disorder , along with , for example , BDD , eating disorders such as anorexia nervosa , and movement disorders such as Tourette's Syndrome ( TS ) . Skin-pickers often feel the need to camouflage their blemishes with make-up or cover bad areas with clothing . Social embarrassment can lead the sufferer to stay indoors , avoid friends , be late for work as their picking and make-up routine takes so long , or even to take sickness leave from work when their skin is in a very bad state . What treatment is available ? The best advice initially is to consult your GP . Many sufferers are very embarrassed by their symptoms and not all doctors are well-informed , so one idea would be to write down",3.0

The Good , the Bad and the Obligatory Colin McGinn has argued that ordinary morality requires that each of us be morally perfect . Moral perfection McGinn defines as always doing what is obligatory , and never doing what is impermissible . Since large feats of self-sacrifice are not obligatory , it follows that moral perfection does not include performing large feats of self-sacrifice . Ordinary morality , however , according to McGinn , requires that each of us always does what is obligatory , and never does what is impermissible . Since to do this is to be morally perfect , it follows that ordinary morality requires that each of us be morally perfect . In this article I argue that , in addition to actions that are obligatory and impermissible , there are actions that optional but good to do , and actions that are optional but bad to do . On McGinn's account , a person could always do what is obligatory , and never do what is impermissible , and always do what is optional but bad to do , and never do what is optional but good to do , and still be morally perfect . But this is absurd . Hence his definition of moral perfection must be rejected . Return to Programme or Paper Abstracts </doc>",3.0

AUTHORS Michael Massimi & Daniela Rosner ABSTRACT Technology increasingly plays a role in the way that we prepare for , celebrate , and reflect upon major life events . Modern digital artefacts , such as Facebook messages and digital photos , now stand alongside traditional artefacts , such as guest books and heirloom jewellery , as cherished mementos of these occasions . Considering how these physical artefacts are crafted provides a useful lens for understanding the evolving relationship among digital tools , the artefacts they produce , and the major life events where these artefacts are used and imbued with meaning . In this paper , we present themes from an interview study conducted with crafters who created items for major life events including weddings , household moves , and births . Our findings outline properties of the crafting process and of the crafted items . Across all occasions , crafters saw major life events as opportunities to learn new skills and use special materials to create personalized artefacts that codified and extended interpersonal relationships . This occurred in parallel with a creative , thoughtful process to make crafts that were appropriate for each occasion and meaningful enough to be kept and treasured for years to come . We reflect on the properties of these crafters' processes and artefacts , and suggest implications for the role of digital tools and assets in relation to major life events . In particular , digital ways to reveal an artefact's provenance and relationship to an event may be useful for augmenting its symbolic meaning and its ability to represent interpersonal relationships . </doc>",3.0

Critic The PlayStation 4 Pro is a new breed of console . It 's not going to replace the original system . Instead , it 's meant to tide over gamers who 've upgraded to new 4K TVs with fancy high-dynamic-range ( HDR ) lighting features . It 's a more significant step up than the Xbox One S , which is mostly centered around upscaling 4K content , but it 'll compete directly with Microsoft's bigger console upgrade , Project Scorpio , next year . Welcome to the new era of gaming systems , which is beginning to resemble the world of PC games with a multitude of minor upgrades , rather than completely new system generations . ( Nintendo , ever the iconoclast , is trying to do something both new and traditional with the Switch . ) There 's no doubt that the $ 399 PlayStation 4 Pro is the closest we 've gotten to high-end PC-quality graphics on a home console . But the thing is , it 's not going to be a major upgrade for existing PS4 owners . And to really see the benefits of its faster hardware , you 'll have to wait for games to get upgraded . At the very least , though , it 's a welcome reward for anyone who 's held off on buying a PlayStation 4 until now . Engadget Score Poor Uninspiring Good Excellent Key Pros Cons Not a huge upgrade for existing PS4 owners with 1080p TVs . No 4K Blu-ray drive . You 'll have to wait for games to get patched to take advantage of it . Summary The PlayStation 4 Pro is the most powerful home console yet , though you 'll need a 4K / HDR TV to truly take",3.0

Lies are woven into our lives from early childhood to the end of our lives . They are so pervasive that many go unnoticed and barely cause a flutter .

Many in Croatia regard Gen Gotovina as a national hero The Vatican is helping Croatia's most wanted war crimes suspect evade capture , a top UN prosecutor alleges . Carla del Ponte , chief prosecutor for war crimes in the former Yugoslavia , has said she believes Gen Ante Gotovina is hiding in a monastery in Croatia . Ms del Ponte's spokeswoman told the BBC News website that the Vatican had refused to help in the search for him , despite being in a position to do so . A spokesman for the Croatian Catholic Church rejected the charges . In a statement later the Vatican said that Archbishop Giovanni Lajolo , responsible for the city-state's foreign relations , had asked Ms del Ponte for further details of her assertions . Chief spokesman Joaquin Navarro-Valls said Ms del Ponte had not yet responded to requests for further information . Divided opinions Gen Gotovina has been charged with the deaths of 150 Serb civilians in 1995 . Earlier this year , the European Union cited Zagreb's failure to arrest him as the reason behind delaying talks on Croatia's entry into the bloc . Forces under Gen Gotovina's command are accused of killing scores of Serbs and expelling up to 200,000 from the Krajina region , now part of Croatia . Many in Croatia regard him as a national hero . Ms del Ponte wants the authorities to act against war criminals Croatian authorities have insisted they are doing everything in their power to deliver Gen Gotovina to the UN's war crimes tribunal in the Hague . The Croatian Bishops' Conference , which heads the Croatian Roman Catholic Church , dismissed Ms del Ponte's allegations . Its spokesman Antun Suljic said the conference "" has no knowledge or indications of the whereabouts",3.0

Schools hold a key role in the government's agenda for reforming children's services . Many people in schools are already supporting children's social and emotional development . But although teachers have regular contact with more children than any other profession , most do n't accept responsibility for promoting children's welfare or supporting parents . As Chris Waterman of the Confederation of Education Service Managers points out , schools need to engage now in a debate about their role in communities , and the changes needed if children are to benefit from integrated local services . </doc>",3.0

Do It Yourself Furniture Restoration Do it yourself furniture restoration is now a huge niche in the house and home renovation sector and many products and services are flooding onto the market . If you 're new at this game it will pay you to be bit careful with how you proceed at first . For instance , when dealing with old furniture do n't just assume that you need to strip away the battered old surface . In many cases this is just not necessary . Many of those early finishes such as shellac and varnish can be restored beautifully , unlike modern laminates or urethaned surfaces . Even pieces that have to be stripped because they 've been painted over can still be brought back to life without having to attempt a French polish job which may end in disaster . There is a product on the market called Restor-A-Finish which can do amazing some might even say , unbelievable things . All you need apart from a tin of Restor-A-Finish is some 0000 grade steel wool and some clean cloth . If your piece of furniture was polished years ago using shellac or varnish , your job is likely to be pretty easy and very rewarding . How do you tell ? A rule of thumb is that anything manufactured before 1960 will have been finished in a fairly traditional manner and not with a polyurethane type material . Up to the 1970s the "" modern "" finishes used were better able to be repaired than later "" space-age "" polyurethane .

Average annual NO 2 levels in Paris 2009 Image credit : Airparif Background to the Aphekom project This brochure provides a description of the project , its scope , the needs it meets , how it meets them , who its partners are , and how it has been funded . Summary report of findings This report describes key findings of our work over the years 2008-2011 . The findings show that life expectancy and monetary benefits increase significantly when levels of fine particles are reduced further in European cities . They reveal that living near busy roads substantially increases the total burden of disease attributable to air pollution . And they underscore the benefits from regulating pollution near busy roads beyond the achievements of current EU legislation . Final Stakeholders Meeting Hosted by the project's coordinator , Institut de Veille Sanitaire ( French Institute for Public Health Surveillance ) , this meeting brought Aphekom scientists together with policy makers , other scientists and representatives of international organisations and NGOs from across Europe to discuss Aphekom's findings and a wide range of issues concerning urban air pollution and health in Europe .

jQuery UI PT Coverflow Mar 22 2012 5 : 00 PM Ever since iTunes popularized the coverflow interface , people have been adapting versions of it for the web . When we were rebuilding our website and wanted to use that interface heavily , nothing on the net would fit the bill - so we built our own . We ended up creating with the smoothest , most versatile , and easy to use jQuery coverflow module available . We started with a robust , JavaScript-based linear algebra solution for perspective transformations . Some coverflows "" fake "" it and transform each square into a parallelogram - a visual approximation . Our JavaScript approach provides limitless perpective potential and supports the largest selection of browsers possible . Since the transformations do leverage the HTML5 canvas element , older "" downlevel "" browsers can not see the perspective effect - however the plugin does "" gracefully "" degrade - older browsers still see a working coverflow , just without the perspective . After perfecting the perspective , reflection , and animation algorithms , we then proceeded to add a ton of options to make this coverflow truly robust and adaptable to many applications . With both the ability to create categories as well as full API access , this coverflow could be used in a variety of commercial contents . Combined with AJAX calls , it could even be "" infinitely "" long ! We have been cultivating a . Net library since the framework version 1.1 , and have been evolving it over the years as the .

The construction industry is acknowledging its role as one of the more important consumers of materials and energy . As the preservation of the earth's remaining natural resources becomes a global concern with all sectors finding ways to do their share , the construction sector has come up with the concept of the "" green building "" design . The green building system promotes energy savings , renewable raw materials , and minimized pollution . At the forefront of this green building revolution are pre-engineered and prefabricated steel buildings . Throughout their entire lifecycle , steel buildings , compared with concrete buildings , use lesser energy , have lesser material consumption , and lesser waste materials during their construction . Besides being 100 % recyclable and reusable , the steel used in prefabricated steel buildings can contribute toward several other LEED credits , either directly or indirectly . For instance , steel buildings , which are designed through the use of revolutionary engineering and technology , are weather tight and have superior structural integrity . The use of steel as a building envelope results in less air loss and better HVAC performance over the life of steel buildings . All the building components of steel buildings are manufactured to their exact specifications , which means that on-site waste is greatly minimized . When steel buildings are demolished , the magnetic properties of steel , greatly facilitates its separation from other materials , ready for recycling once again . The high LEED ratings of prefabricated steel buildings make them the intelligent choice over traditional methods of construction , especially for those who want to make their share in the "" green revolution "" . </doc>",4.0

The massacres that the Israeli Government and the Israeli occupation forces are committing against the Palestinian people are no less savage and cruel than the Sabra and Shatila , Qibia , Khan Yunis and Nahalin massacres . In every city and refugee camp that they have entered , Israeli occupation forces have repeated the same pattern : indiscriminate firing and the killing of innocent civilians , intentional harm to water , electricity and telephone infrastructure , taking over civilian houses , extensive damage to civilian property , shooting at ambulances and prevention of medical care to the injured .

Fee or commission – what 's the best business model ? According to research by Cerulli , it appears that the answer is "" both . "" The AUM of so-called "" hybrid "" advisors who can earn both fees and commissions grew 19.1 % in 2012 , while pure RIAs grew 14.7 % . While the argument has raged in the DC market over the last decade , with some pundits declaring the commission-based model dead , the best answer seems to be that advisors should be flexible enough to be able to serve clients and sell products based on their needs , not on the desired business model . Especially popular among plan advisors , the hybrid model allows them to collect trails from commissioned products they might have sold in the past even if they currently sell fee-based only ; some advisors keep their broker dealer affiliation for variable annuities . Converting commission-based plans to fee-based can take time , and not all providers are willing and able . Aggregators trying to attract new advisors prefer the hybrid model , since many advisors look to own their RIA apart from their broker dealer – especially advisors moving from the independent BD model . </doc>",4.0

FARMINGTON , Conn. – The number of smartphone shipments to rise from 700 million in 2012 to 1.37 billion by the end of 2017 . Apple's iOS and Google's Android will continue to dominate the market with a combined market share of 81.7 % of smartphone shipments in 2017 , up from 78 % in 2012 . Unlike OS market share , handset vendor market share will be volatile during the forecast period . Smartphone vendors can be removed from the top share positions in less than a year ( for example , HTC and RIM in 2011 ) , because the market evolves extremely fast and competition is fierce . Operators should resist the temptation to develop their own smartphone platform . A bad track record in software and content distribution and a lack of hardware design and capabilities are major pitfalls for any operator-controlled smartphone platform . Executives seeking detailed market research on global smartphone markets and spectrum valuation will benefit from the two reports previewed below . Retaining established smartphone users is as important as capturing new ones . 75 % of worldwide smartphone shipments will correspond to handset upgrades in 2017 ( see Figure 1 ) . This will create a significant strategy shift for stakeholders . Operators will have to increase the value of smartphone contracts by offering early handset upgrades and larger data allowances to retain customers , and handset vendors will have to develop stronger app and content ecosystems ( as Apple has done ) in order to increase loyalty . The addressable market represented by multi-device ecosystems is still relatively small , but will grow significantly in the next 5 years . Operators should embrace those ecosystems in the following ways : 1 ) Offer multi-device data plans so that consumers can",4.0

China and Russia in the New World Disorder Can Kosovo achieve independence without the tacit consent of Russia , and can there be a humanitarian and political solution to the tragedy in Darfur without the active goodwill of China ? The two crises have nothing in common , but their resolution will depend in large part on whether these two permanent members of the United Nations Security Council use their veto power . Comparing the respective abilities of Russia and China to block key international initiatives makes no sense in itself , but it does constitute a useful tool for understanding the transformation of the international system that is now taking place as a direct consequence of the relative decline of America's global power . From that standpoint , the deepening of chaos in the Middle East poses both opportunities and risks for Russia and China , which may force them to define the roles they want to play and the images they want to project in the world . The key question is this : Is Russia taking giant steps in the "" wrong direction "" while China is taking "" minuscule "" steps in the "" right direction "" ? Superficially , Russia and China may give the impression that they are pursuing the same path when they both proclaim with pride that they are "" back "" on the world stage . But this boast means different things for each country . For China , a deeply self-confident country , to be "" back "" simply means regaining the country's historical centrality in the world after an absence of more than two centuries . After all , at the end of the eighteenth century , China became the world's first producer of manufactured goods , and it",4.0

' Having organised my older children's parties in the past , I understood the importance of getting it just right for them ' explains Marina . ' I always wanted something special , but juggling work , a busy mum schedule and organising a party often meant I had bitten off more than I could chew ' . ' There is always so much to organise - did I go for a disco , an entertainer or bouncy castle ? What about the cake ? What about invites ? And where was I going to hold it ?

CHAPTER V. RESULT OF THE DANGERS . Gringoire , thoroughly stunned by his fall , remained on the pavement in front of the Holy Virgin at the street corner . Little by little , he regained his senses ; at first , for several minutes , he was floating in a sort of half-somnolent revery , which was not without its charm , in which aeriel figures of the gypsy and her goat were coupled with Quasimodo's heavy fist . This state lasted but a short time . A decidedly vivid sensation of cold in the part of his body which was in contact with the pavement , suddenly aroused him and caused his spirit to return to the surface . "" Whence comes this chill ? "" he said abruptly , to himself . He then perceived that he was lying half in the middle of the gutter . "" That devil of a hunchbacked cyclops ! "" he muttered between his teeth ; and he tried to rise . But he was too much dazed and bruised ; he was forced to remain where he was . Moreover , his hand was tolerably free ; he stopped up his nose and resigned himself . "" The mud of Paris , "" he said to himself--for decidedly he thought that he was sure that the gutter would prove his refuge for the night ; and what can one do in a refuge , except dream ? -- "" the mud of Paris is particularly stinking ; it must contain a great deal of volatile and nitric salts .

Darcy then was . She longed to know what at the moment was passing in his mind--in what manner he thought of her , and whether , in defiance of everything , she was still dear to him . Perhaps he had been civil only because he felt himself at ease ; yet there had been THAT in his voice which was not like ease . Whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in seeing her she could not tell , but he certainly had not seen her with composure . At length , however , the remarks of her companions on her absence of mind aroused her , and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself . They entered the woods , and bidding adieu to the river for a while , ascended some of the higher grounds ; when , in spots where the opening of the trees gave the eye power to wander , were many charming views of the valley , the opposite hills , with the long range of woods overspreading many , and occasionally part of the stream . Mr. Gardiner expressed a wish of going round the whole park , but feared it might be beyond a walk . With a triumphant smile they were told that it was ten miles round . It settled the matter ; and they pursued the accustomed circuit ; which brought them again , after some time , in a descent among hanging woods , to the edge of the water , and one of its narrowest parts . They crossed it by a simple bridge , in character with the general air of the scene ; it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited ; and the",4.0

The IRS has allowed tax benefits to people by way of the 401k for many years now . That 's why 401k plans have become the largest employer-sponsored retirement account type . If you are looking for rules for 401k distributions , you have either reached time to retire or want to tap the 401k for some much needed money . Regardless of the reason , you should be careful to abide by the 401k distribution rules , which are different for early 401k withdrawals and those made at the age 591 ⁄ 2 or older . As for early 401k withdrawals , they have the likelihood of causing two taxable situations on the individual's tax return . Aside from paying Federal income tax on the sum withdrawn , an early withdrawal in most cases also causes penalties of 10 % on the distribution sum . However , there is a 401k hardship rule , also applied to 403b plans and 457 plans , which makes allowances for early 401k withdrawals in certain situations . They include expenses for medical care , costs of the purchase of a principal residence , educational fees , funeral expenses and certain repair expenses . Do not forget that the abovementioned exceptions just specify conditions when you may get access to your 401k assets , but not represent exceptions to penalties or tax . The penalties wo n't apply if distributions before reaching age 591 ⁄ 2 are effected in the certain situations . They include payments made to the beneficiary in result of the death of the participant , disability of the participant , and a number of others . Meanwhile , you have to realize that although the IRS makes provisions for early distributions , it may happen that your employer's plan",4.0

She was at the airport returning to the UK on the 3rd April when she was detained by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard . She has been transferred to an unknown location in Kerman Province , 1,000 kilometres south of Tehran , and is being held in solitary confinement . Gabriella Ratcliffe our 22 month old daughter ( who has British citizenship only ) has had her British passport confiscated , and is stranded in Iran with her grandparents . Nazanin has not been allowed to access a lawyer or her daughter . She has not been able to call out of the country to speak to me , her British husband , and the Red Cross have not been able to make contact . There have been no charges . Nazanin has informed her family that she has been required to sign a confession under duress , its content unknown . Her family have been informed that the investigation relates to an issue of ' national security ' . It is hard to understand how a young mother and her small child on holiday could be considered an issue of national security . She has been to Iran to visit her family regularly since making Britain her home . Nazanin currently works as a project manager for the Thomson-Reuters Foundation ; which delivers charitable projects around the world . It does not work in Iran .

Stem cells are notable for being fecund -- they continually generate new cells . So too do cancer cells , however . Indeed , stem cells and cancer cells are beginning to seem very close relations . In one recent study , adult stem cells ( those obtained from mature animals , rather than early embryos ) were found to develop into tumour cell lines when grown in the laboratory . A team from Spain collected stem cells from fat tissue and grew them in culture for eight months . Some developed into cells that generated cancers when injected into animals . In a second study , a Danish team found that permanently activating telomerase in similar stem cells also made them cancerous . Telomerase protects the ends of chromosomes , which usually wear away at every cell division . Telomerase can prolong the lifespan of a cultured cell line , but leaves it vulnerable to uncontrolled proliferation . Studies of certain cells obtained from breast cancers are also disturbing . These cells can seed new breast cancers , and look very much like stem cells . Finally , Carla Bender Kim and colleagues recently identified a ' pocket ' in the adult mouse lung containing stem cells . As well as providing new lung epithelial cells , these cells can be triggered to proliferate by cancer-causing mutations . These and other studies highlight the perils as well as the potential of cellular immortality . They also raise questions about the use of adult stem cells in therapy . Rubio D et al.

This report summarises research in primary science and ICT , including a focus on scientific literacy and children's learning . The contribution and potential of ICT in primary science is evaluated . front cover The report identifies the need for focused and systematic research . It would be relevant for classroom practitioners , curriculum and software developers . The report is in five parts . Part one focuses on the debate about the meaning of scientific literacy and the question of what science should be taught in the primary curriculum . Part two focuses on the nature and value of primary science and includes some basic practical advice relating to the teacher's role . Part three provides a survey of some of the research relating to children's learning in science and begins to focus on the role of ICT . Issues of pupil age and gender as well as that of teachers' science knowledge are identified with reference to research findings . A discussion of the implications of a constructivist approach to science is undertaken , highlighting the following challenges : ' One of the principal problems a teacher faces when using constructivist approaches to science teaching is the consideration of the unique ideas and experiences 30 individuals bring to each new science topic . How can the teacher elicit and challenge all of these to ensure that children develop the desired scientific concepts ? How can s / he ensure that each child is involved in science investigation ? How can s / he promote group work with limited science resources so that children can co-operate in science projects ? ' p 20 The view is presented that the primary curriculum should be made more exciting and comprehensible by focusing on observation and description , leaving explanation for KS3",4.0

I 'm 11 years old and have Haemophilia A. My family did n't realise until I was 7 and a half when I lost my first baby tooth , although we were always wondering why I was black and blue with bruises . I decided that each year I would do one big event and raise what I could for the Society . That first year I did my first 100ft abseil . The next year I swam a mile ( that was really tough ) and then when I was 10 I did a 5-mile Triangle : I canoed 5 miles , cycled 5 miles and then walked 5 miles ! This year I fully organised a Book Sale . I collected books from everyone I knew , then made lots of posters and got some stickers from the Society . I got up at 4 . 30am and stayed until 2pm . We did n't do as well as I wished but I am quite happy with £ 110 . I am now thinking about what I can do next year ! </doc>",4.0

Yet , as is increasingly the case in the PC software market , you wo n't find the antidote to brand dominance on the shelves of your local software emporium , nor by spending five minutes in the company of Amazon . No , instead you 've got a teeny weeny bit of work to do . It 's worth it though . What you need to do is navigate over to www.newstarsoccer.com and download the trial version of New Star Soccer 3 . At first glance it 's as rudimentary and out of date a football game as you can probably think up , mixing in graphics that Sensible Soccer was rivalling back in the mid-90s and an interface that 's lacking much in the way of visual punch . Yet in the same way that Sensible Soccer , and Kick Off before it , prioritised playability above all other factors , so New Star Soccer gets its house firmly in order , resulting in a supremely playable and fresh football extravaganza . The twist to it is that you take the role of one player . You set him up , choose a position you want to play , toggle appearance , favoured foot , that kind of stuff .

Darren Johnson , openly Gay Green London Assembly Member , comments : "" The Government thinks it acceptable for Gay and Lesbian people to continue as second class citizens . "" The so-called "" Equality "" Bill , leaves the door open for Gays to be banned from hotels , discriminated against at university and by insurance companies . Moreover it even exempts public bodies from the duty to protect Gay and Lesbian people's rights .

AMERICA The American Connection Murder 9 / 11 The Land Of The Free ............................................. The question is often asked why do terrorists act as they do ? Why would someone fly a plane into a building killing hundreds of people but also ending their own lives ? The terrorist kills to impose their will on others . The fanatical belief that their way and the way of violence is paramount infests their minds . The terrorist can not understand freedom . They can not understand the complex web of life , they can not understand the diversity of nature and creation . They only understand their perception of the world and will kill to enforce it . Many also choose to die i.e. the act of suicide to impose their universal worldview . Bobby Sands and Mohamed Atta may never have known each other . They died for different ' causes ' but their act was the same . They ended their own lives , they worked to take the lives of others , because they hate freedom .

Macclesfield businesses object to third arcade - 15 / 06 / 06 Log in to remember this page . Email this Ten businesses in the town of Macclesfield have submitted letters of objection to plans for a new amusement arcade in the city's town centre , arguing that a third venue could lead to increased anti-social behaviour and that there is no demand for more fruit machines . The licensing committee is currently debating a proposal by Red Rose Leisure for the third amusement arcade in a 900ft pedestrianised stretch of Macclesfield's town centre , and a Gaming Machine Permit will go before the borough council on Monday . Shipley's Amusement , one of the already established arcades in the stretch , said : "" Looking at the usage of our premises you can safely say there is no demand for further premises offering similar machines . The public interested in this activity in Macclesfield town centre lack for nothing . "" A spokesperson for the other arcade , Silver Coin , commented "" I do n't think there 's anything more another arcade can offer . I do n't think it 's necessary at all . "" It 's just such a small area and there 's only going to be five minutes walking distance between the arcades themselves . "" Phil Butterworth , co-owner of Red Rose Leisure , defended the application , saying : "" We are not looking to make it an amusement arcade for kids , it 's going to be for 18 or 21-year-olds . "" We have two in Kendal within a couple of hundred yards of each other and there 's no problems at all . We can offer something different because we have a unique way in which we run our",4.0

Apple and the Environment Frequently Asked Questions Q : How does Apple review the company's progress and status regarding its environmental impact ? A : Apple's Executive Team is responsible for setting and implementing environmental policies . This group of the company's most senior executives is advised by teams from across Apple , including environmental engineering , product development , operations , facilities , and supplier responsibility . Apple's climate change strategy is built into all facilities development plans and plays an important role in the product development process . In 2009 , at the direction of the Executive Team , Apple became the first company in the electronics industry to report its entire carbon footprint including the impact of its products on the environment through consumer use . In addition to providing consumers with an unprecedented level of detail and transparency on which to base their purchasing decisions , measuring the company's carbon footprint helps the company identify areas where it can make the most significant reductions . We understand that the vast majority of greenhouse gas emissions ( up to 98 percent ) come from the product life cycle , which is why decisions about the environmental attributes of our products are an integral aspect of all decisions related to the design and manufacture of those products . The same is true of all the environmental decisions for our facilities . Our integrated approach means that decisions about environmental issues are reviewed at the highest levels of the company . This structure has been an important factor in Apple's success , particularly in the area of environmental responsibility . Executive Team members regularly review each new product during its development , focusing on material and design choices , the supply chain , packaging , and product energy efficiency",4.0

Archive for January , 2009 From time to time , we see Internet ad providers tout promotions to convince businesses to give up their Yellow Pages print ads for an online-only advertising strategy . First , it 's all about volume . For most advertisers , any program without print Yellow Pages is suboptimal . Period . Prudent advertisers simply ca n't ignore the sheer volume of leads produced through print Yellow Pages coupled with its strong ROI . Print Yellow Pages get 13.7 billion references each year , so we should n't discount the ready-to-buy consumers who use the directory to find what they need . Second , many Yellow Pages companies are also offering online , mobile , and search solutions – from Internet Yellow Pages listings , to YouTube videos , to Google AdWords setup and monitoring . The fact that we offer that bundle of print , Internet Yellow Pages and search is a huge advantage for directory publishers over online only players . And if we 're doing our job right as publishers , we 'll guide our advertisers to the most effective and efficient solutions that produce the volume of business they need at the right investment level . Third , we can act on our personal relationships . Yellow Pages salespeople work every day with small businesses . We are in the unique position of building off a strong track record of success , built over time , as marketing advisors to small businesses looking for guidance in an increasingly fragmented local media market . The online-only providers do not have this degree of access . Advertising today is increasingly complex . Our future success depends on our ability to help small businesses build their business by finding advertising solutions that work for",4.0

Perceptive Engineering offer three day training courses throughout the year . The objectives of these courses are to provide an introduction to the techniques that are available within the monitorMV software package , to demonstrate how this package can be applied to industrial plants in real-time and to highlight the benefits that monitorMV can offer operations and engineering staff . Throughout the course mathematical technicalities are kept to a minimum with greater emphasis being placed on the practical issues of the statistical technology and control within monitorMV . At the end of the course , attendees should be in a position where they are comfortable with the monitorMV software environment , able to analyse process data and capable of developing effective real-time condition monitoring solutions for application to industrial process plant . Structure of the Course The 3-day training course divides itself naturally into three key issues : An overview of multivariate statistical techniques and their exploitation in the monitorMV software package . This issue is addressed in the first half of day one of the course . A detailed exploration of the off-line analysis capabilities of monitorMV is provided which together with a series of hands-on case studies provides the attendee with a thorough understanding of both the capabilities and configuration of the monitorMV package when applied to both continuous and batch operations .

And that to pursue one realm to the <font color = green>disregard</font> of the other , is to open oneself to ultimate sadness in <font color = green>older</font> age .

What health effects can the cold weather have ? Severe cold weather has impact on health and can be dangerous for those groups which are more vulnerable . The table below shows the effect that different indoor temperatures may have on health . Indoor temperature Effect 21 ° C ( 70 ̊ F ) Minimum recommended daytime temperature for rooms occupied during the day How can I get help to stay warm ? For most people being ready for cold and wintery weather is about taking sensible precautions such as wearing a few more layers , wearing sensible footwear when going out or simply running the heating system for a while longer . Some people however need a bit of extra help in order to cope with the cold , although they may not always ask for it . In many cases what is needed is a friend or neighbor who can check on them and take care of simple tasks , whether this is picking up some items at the shops or lighting the fire . In some cases a bit more support is needed and so to provide this support Northamptonshire County Council has teamed up with Age UK , Nene Valley Community Action , Northamptonshire Community Foundation , NHS Northamptonshire and several other organizations to create the "" Wrapped Up "" scheme . Using money from the Governments Warm Homes Health People Initiative , wrapped up is intended to get the meaningful help and support to those who need it .

This is not for the person or company who has not even setup social profiles , this is for the person or business that has profiles but has completely missed how to use them . They have completely missed the opportunity to engage with their fans or customers . One condition on winning the award , you have to give the award back if you actually become aware you won because you were following social media . Because he is completely absent from all conversation about him and his band the 2011 Are You Listening Social Media Award is presented to ... Kip Winger ! What did Kip Winger not do to get this award ? In June of 2011 at the Conclave radio conference , a annual gathering of radio and music industry professionals , Winger was mentioned during a presentation . Following the presentation Winger took on a life and was being mentioned throughout the entire day in many Tweets . Not one acknowledgement by Winger . This was a gathering of a radio and music professionals remember . Six months later a number of professionals are still talking about Winger , but now joking how he is absent ... where is Kip Winger ? Still not one acknowledgement by Winger .

Nashville , TN – Today , Defenders of Wildlife , Statewide Organizing for Community eMpowerment ( SOCM ) , Tennessee Clean Water Network ( TCWN ) and Sierra Club filed a first of its kind suit against the Office of Surface Mining ( OSM ) and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service alleging that the government agencies violated the Endangered Species Act by approving mining permits for the Zeb Mountain and Davis Creek Area 5 surface mines in Tennessee . Sierra Club and its allies argue that OSM and the Service failed to fully consider the effects pollution from mining operations would have on the endangered Cumberland darter and the threatened blackside dace ; two fresh water fish found primarily in the areas threatened by mining waste pollution from these sites . Specifically , the groups allege that OSM and the Fish and Wildlife Service have ignored the best science and data available that show how specific forms of mining pollution at these sites endanger the dace and darter . "" Extinction of endangered species is too high a price to pay for surface mining , "" said Mary Anne Hitt , Director of Sierra Club's Beyond Coal Campaign . "" The Office of Surface Mining failed in its duty to ensure endangered species were protected when it granted mining permits at Zeb Mountain and Davis Creek . Mining pollution from these sites clearly poses a risk to the dace and darter ; these permits should have never been allowed to go forward . "" The groups contend that high levels of water conductivity created by mining pollution put the future of the blackside dace and Cumberland darter at risk . Conductivity is a measure of the ability of fresh water to carry an electric current . The higher the",4.0

The Swansea talkathon of the National Policy Forum on 15-17 January considered three final-year documents and six first-year documents . Reports of group discussions were collated and fed back to the whole Forum , where we had another attempt at inserting points unaccountably omitted by the note-takers , like the merits of universal benefits against means-testing . Every set of New Labour papers has its mantra . The Third Way was last year's fashion , and in 1999 ' joined-up thinking ' is all the rage . In fact , Forum members proved rather more joined-up and forward-looking than the authors . Robin Cook stressed that Labour will only win a second term with fresh ideas and a full programme . Yet the papers concentrated on the Tory legacy and current government activity , not on plans for the next century . While this stuff belongs in campaign material , reminding people that there are worse beasts out there , by the election we will have to defend a four-year Labour legacy as well . There were many requests that second-year documents should highlight changes resulting from party comment , to counter cynicism about what happens to constituency resolutions and views from local forums . Several common themes emerged . First , all policies should be set in a European context . Tony Blair will have the support of activists , if not of Rupert Murdoch , whenever he calls the single currency referendum . Many people highlighted the rural dimension . Problems are different and less visible in the countryside , and they can not just be relegated to agriculture , only six per cent of the rural economy . Existing differences between Scotland , Wales and England will increase with devolution , and were barely acknowledged . Joined-up",4.0

"" – skimping the measure , boosting the price and cheating with dishonest scales , 6 buying the poor with silver and the needy for a pair of sandals , selling even the sweepings with the wheat . 7 The LORD has sworn by the Pride of Jacob : "" I will never forget anything they have done . 8 "" Will not the land tremble for this , and all who live in it mourn ? The whole land will rise like the Nile ; it will be stirred up and then sink like the river of Egypt . 9 "" In that day , "" declares the Sovereign LORD , "" I will make the sun go down at noon and darken the earth in broad daylight . 10 I will turn your religious feasts into mourning and all your singing into weeping",4.0

<font color = yellow>The</font> Slippery Rock Sliders were formed for the 2007 season to ensure an even number of teams with the Frontier League's addition of the Southern Illinois Miners . The Sliders played 32 home games at Jack Critchfield Park in Slippery Rock , Pennsylvania , with the remaining 64 played on the road . For the 2008 season , the Sliders became a traveling team , playing all of their games on the road under the geographical moniker , Midwest . The Sliders ' 2009 season began on May 29 , at Eastern Michigan University ' s Oestrike Stadium located in Ypsilanti , Michigan . The Sliders played strong - a 33-33 record after 66 games .

Sam and Fiona begin to argue that Jesse is not fit for their team while Michael gives him the benefit of the doubt . Jesse shows up during the argument with drinks and soon changes Sams mind about being on the team . Jesse begins to talk to the others about why he came to Miami and tells them that he has information about some illegal weapons trade but his only source on this is from a person he calls "" Cobra "" . Sam is not enthused by the name . Michael decides that maybe this is worth investigating . The gang arrives at the dock to scope out what exactly they are dealing with . They find it is tough to get any info from any of the dock workers about where the ships with the weapons have come from . While talking with Fiona and Michael , Jesse notices a dock security guard getting beat up . He says he has seen this before and wants to finally end this . Michael tells Jesse it 's not worth blowing cover to help a civilian . Jesse does n't listen and goes over to help .

State lawmakers may try to place a moratorium on using predictions of accelerated sea-level rise in coastal planning while the state studies the issue in the coming years . Rep. Pat McElraft , R-Carteret , on Tuesday discussed a plan to address the contentious sea-level-rise issue this year and beyond . The House , she said , could take up the sea-level-rise bill this week and vote not to accept the measure as it recently passed the Senate . If the House votes not to concur with the Senate version , it would put the issue in front of a conference committee of House and Senate members . There , McElraft said , the plan is to place a moratorium on using accelerated rates of sea-level rise in writing coastal development policies while the state studies the issue . McElraft said a study , which would be conducted at least in part by the Coastal Resources Commission , should look at all of the available science on the issue , "" not just one model like the Science Panel looked at . "" "" We need to look at this more scientifically and not with a political agenda , "" McElraft said . As it passed the Senate , the bill would prohibit state agencies from using projections of accelerated sea-level rise – mainly from global warming and the melting of polar ice caps – in drafting coastal development rules . Instead they would have to use only historical sea-level-rise data . The historic rates of rise are much lower than many scientists believe the seas will rise in the future . But that report has been criticized by some along the coast who say planning for such a dramatic rise in sea levels could have a significant economic impact",4.0

' Inferno ' Review : Tom Hanks ' Return as ' Da Vinci Code ' Hero Goes Up in Flames Third adaptation of Dan Brown's bestselling religio-pulp series feels like a trip to hell and back – and not in a good way ' Inferno , ' the third movie of Dan Brown's bestselling religio-pulp novels starring Tom Hanks , feels like a trip to hell and back , says Peter Travers . ' Inferno ' Review : Tom Hanks ' Return as ' Da Vinci Code ' Hero Goes Up in Flames More News Here 's the third futile attempt by director Ron Howard to turn the bestselling claptrap of author Dan Brown into something watchable . He comes close , but not close enough . This time Robert Langdon , the Harvard symbologist played as if against his will by Tom Hanks , suffers from retrograde amnesia . Lucky guy – I can remember all too well how the film's plodding predecessors , The Da Vinci Code ( 2006 ) and Angels & Demons ( 2009 ) , stubbornly refused to come to life . Howard , shooting in Florence and Istanbul , makes things look compellingly atmospheric . And Hanks is one of the most likable actors on the planet . But Inferno just lays there onscreen , pancake-flat and with no animating spark to make us give a damn . Related From awards-worthy dramas and controversial history lessons to a new ' Star Wars , ' what you need to see Which is strange , since the fate of the world hangs in the balance in David Koepp's surprise-free script . Extremist billionaire Bertrand Zobrist ( Ben Foster , a master at crazed stares ) has decided there are too many people in the world .",4.0

It mattered not that they made him sea-sick--he made no account of this inconvenience ; and , whilst his body was writhing under their effects , his spirit bounded with hopeful exultation . Passepartout was enraged beyond expression by the unpropitious weather . Everything had gone so well till now ! Earth and sea had seemed to be at his master's service ; steamers and railways obeyed him ; wind and steam united to speed his journey . Had the hour of adversity come ? Passepartout was as much excited as if the twenty thousand pounds were to come from his own pocket . The storm exasperated him , the gale made him furious , and he longed to lash the obstinate sea into obedience . Poor fellow ! Fix carefully concealed from him his own satisfaction , for , had he betrayed it , Passepartout could scarcely have restrained himself from personal violence . Passepartout remained on deck as long as the tempest lasted , being unable to remain quiet below , and taking it into his head to aid the progress of the ship by lending a hand with the crew . He overwhelmed the captain , officers , and sailors , who could not help laughing at his impatience , with all sorts of questions . He wanted to know exactly how long the storm was going to last ; whereupon he was referred to the barometer , which seemed to have no intention of rising . Passepartout shook it , but with no perceptible effect ; for neither shaking nor maledictions could prevail upon it to change its mind . On the 4th , however , the sea became more calm , and the storm lessened its violence ; the wind veered southward , and was",4.0

Choosing a cutting style is matter of preference , desired degree of difficulty , and asthetics of matching the style to the image .

Sometimes , I just match the style to what looks good with the image . <font color = gray>For</font> <font color = gray>example</font> , for snowy images I sometimes use the Continuous Knob style ( see below ) because it looks like round clumps of snowflakes . I 've just added a new style I 've deemed "" Random fun "" . See why below . Most mass-produced paper puzzles use what is called a "" strip cut "" .

Deep in the Bowels of Beit Basement ( June 1998 - October 1999 ) [ Photo Gallery ] In mid-1998 , a Union Sabbatical , who was also a member of Jazz and Rock society , happened to mention that they had a old room in the Beit basement that was n ' t in use . The committee of the time proceeded to make a nuisance of themselves until the society was given permission to take over this much larger room for the library . The room was a mess - cigarette ash several inches deep , the walls covered in eggboxes ( sound proofing ) , and some wooden construction in the middle of the room . After much effort ( and the smashing of a light fitting ) , the place was cleaned out and made ready for painting . The room became white with a dark blue network of piping . Two giant metal struts , studded with bolts , were carefully painted to resemble Daleks . It was a strangely industrial room , with large apparently random concrete blocks ( which made for good seating but inconvenienced shelf layout ) , an abundant selection of different pipes , complete with taps and broken-off ends , and one particularly large and complex ' feature ' ( a sewage output ? ) that was a real pain to paint . A large dragon mural ( "" Flarebright "" ) covered one stretch of wall , designed by karne , and painted by karne , Viv , and Liz . The door was covered with blackboard paint , so that ' useful ' messages could , theoretically , be written on it in chalk . A large sign declaring something about parking was obtained , and the back",4.0

T5 : The Excavation Archaeological excavation began at T5 in April 2002 , with the construction work on the Terminal itself beginning in December 2002 ; the terminal is due to open in spring 2008 . The site is the largest ever excavated in Britain . It has also been innovative in the way that the archaeology has run alongside major construction work by BAA and in the way that interpretation of finds has taken place on site . No single archaeological unit had enough staff to tackle the project alone . Instead , two long-established practices , Oxford Archaeology and Wessex Archaeology , formed a joint venture called Framework Archaeology to work at T5 and all other BAA airports . The excavation was a major challenge to the staff , who worked amid the noise and fumes of the world's busiest international airport . The project was unique in the way that it integrated the archaeological and the commercial . Framework's staff spent seven years designing and planning the project and working in the Heathrow area . The result was a focussed way of carrying out archaeology which allowed the excavators to know which areas were important and so avoid wasting time and money . BAA encouraged the best archaeology possible . They hired archaeological consultant Gill Andrews and Professor John Barrett , from Sheffield University , who , together with Framework Archaeology , developed a unique working method at T5 . By analysing and recording finds on site during excavation , rather than waiting until the end as is usual , staff were able to interpret their findings as they were made as well as ensuring that their work followed the most interesting and important directions . The excavation was rare in having computer terminals onsite and its",4.0

I have a daughter , Mulan . And when she was eight , last year , she was doing a report for school , or she had some homework about frogs . And we were at this restaurant . And she said , "" So , basically , frogs lay eggs and the eggs turn into tadpoles , and tadpoles turn into frogs . "" And I said , "" Yeah . You know , I 'm not really up on my frog reproduction that much . It 's the females , I think , that lay the eggs . And then the males fertilize them . And then they become tadpoles and frogs . "" And she says , "" What ? Only the females have eggs ? "" And I said , "" Yeah . "" And she goes , "" And what 's this fertilizing ? "" So I kind of said , "" Oh , it 's this extra ingredient , you know , that you need to create a new frog from the mom and dad frog . "" And she said , "" Oh , so is that true for humans too ? "" And I thought , "" Okay , here we go . "" I did n't know it would happen so quick , at eight . I was trying to remember all the guidebooks , and all I could remember was , "" Only answer the question they 're asking . Do n't give any more information . "" So I said , "" Yes .

This card game contains 99 cards and follows the format of the original board game , focusing on specific problem or concerns of children . Like the original game , the card game is sure to help children communicate their feelings and develop insight into their problems . Full Description : The Talking , Feeling , and Doing Game - devised by Dr. Richard A. Gardner in 1968 and first published in 1973 - has enjoyed worldwide utilization as an extremely effective psychotherapeutic instrument . Most child therapist 's consider it an indispensable part of their playroom equipment . With a high degree of predictability , the game will engage the most resistant and inhibited children into meaningful psychotherapeutic endeavors . The game routinely facilitates disclosures often not otherwise obtainable . Further , the material elicited by the game serve as points of departure for meaningful psychotherapeutic interchanges . The game has proved helpful for shortening the psychotherapeutic process because quickly and predictably provides the therapist with information about the child's underlying psychological processes . Information that might have taken weeks or even months to elicit may even be obtained during the first few sessions . The game was originally designed to enable inhibited children to reveal themselves , but even children who are more freely engaged in direct discussion and insight-oriented therapy will find it a pleasurable additional psychotherapeutic experience . Sales of the game are restricted to qualified mental health professionals . Buyers must hold at least a Masters Degree in psychology , counseling , social work or a related field , and should have received appropriate clinical training in working with children or adolescents . Please include license number or the name of your graduate school , degree , and year graduated as part of the order",4.0

Majoring in Biology , Society and the Environment while completing a minor is French , serving as a volunteer for the Minnesota Orchestra while also volunteering with injured animals at the Wildlife Rehabilitation Center , Gabby refuses to choose between her love of science and the humanities . This makes her a perfect fit for Friends of the Mississippi River . Whether it 's working alongside people at our events , hand-sorting bags of volunteer-collected native prairie seed , or patiently re-crafting and uploading announcement onto websites of various speeds in the FMR office , Gabby handles it all with aplomb . Gabby's favorite days at FMR are the ones she does n't come in ( well , to the office ) . She loves getting to know previously unfamiliar areas at the outdoor events , and especially enjoys "" seeing all the people you might not normally interact with coming together . "" But she 's enjoying the challenge of her indoor work as well , describing her immersion in an office atmosphere and assistance with outreach work as a "" real learning experience . "" Gabby stays motivated by connecting her cubicle with the river she loves . "" I love being able to carry things through the overall picture , "" she said . "" It 's nice to connect the dots between doing the outreach , attending the events , and then helping with work like sorting the seed that volunteers collected after the event . "" If you 're a student or recent graduate who can connect the dots like Gabby , we 'd love to hear from you . Applications are now being considered for January / February 2013 for both the restoration and education events and the Mississippi River Challenge internship programs .",4.0

Billboard rules of the road We 've pulled out all the stops to advertise the launch of our very own Ascend's Golden Guide . One of the ways we 've decided to advertise the publication and website is through four strategically placed billboards located next to highways throughout the Kansas City metro . Creating a successful billboard is actually more challenging than long-form content . Despite the large space , you have to get your message across instantaneously . Drivers often have fewer than 10 seconds to view . Here are six fundamental rules : Writing for billboards – or bus signs , meeting banners and other large signs meant to be seen from far away – is all about the short and sweet hook . Twitter's 140-character limit is a good introduction to writing concise content , but actually , the most eye-catching billboards are ones that feature seven words or less . It should be catchy and have an immediate effect on the reader . The best billboards hit a nerve with readers . Signs that elicit an emotional response are more memorable . Try the humorous approach , pull on their heartstrings or intrigue or surprise your readers . "" Good advertising is storytelling , "" according to the Outdoor Advertising Association of America ( OAAA ) . "" Dramatic tension or suspense influences viewer interest [ that ] can be expressed on three different cognitive levels : rational , emotional and cultural . "" Rely on imagery over words , if possible . For our billboard campaign , we chose to use a picture of the Ascend's Golden Guide cover for recognition , as the publication is now available in magazine racks at various locations , such as libraries , CVS pharmacies , doctor's offices and",4.0

From James Whitlow regarding adult race leagues : "" In addition to the leagues you mentioned in the last edition , we also run derby races with a point system championship . We are in our 5th year . Check us out at www.sapcar.com From Stan Pope regarding "" Credibility of the Race "" in Volume 7 , Issue 4 : "" This article should be required reading for everyone who wants to ( or has to ) run a PWD race ! Lots of really great points in there ! A couple of observations : When participants stage their own cars , multiple elimination without charts is easier to run than any charted methods . And it produces higher heats per hour with less bother than charted methods . Accuracy is good . For instance , a quintuple elimination race gives high probability of correctly awarding the first 5 place trophies . Electronic finish lines malfunction at times . It is really bad when the organizer allows the mechanically recorded result to stand while the entire audience saw that it was wrong ! Even with the best electronics , there should be two finish line judges on duty to confirm or overrule the finish line electronics . But what should be done about disagreements ? Since heat reruns really slow the race progress and add unfair additional wear on the graphite , I like to combine these two observations as follows : For most of the racing , every judges' determination is honored ! If the three judges ( two human and one mechanical ) disagree , each of their choices is treated as though he won the heat ! This works very well with uncharted multiple elimination ! The cost is that sometimes an additional round of heats",4.0

Story 2 - Taking a GAP year after being rejected This person decided to remain anonymous but wanted to tell their story to let people know taking a forced gap year can be a ' blessing in disguise ' ... In my previous application , I was n't 100 % certain that I really wanted to study medicine , and I was n't fully prepared . I think this showed in my PS ( personal statement ) . As the year went on , I was able to confirm that medicine is what I really want to do . Last year , I applied to 4 med schools with no backup choices . I was rejected after 2 interviews ( I was put on a waiting list at one ) . Obviously I was disappointed , but it did n't come as a surprise . I started to make plans for the next round , and by May , I was looking for jobs on the NHS website and it took about 4 months to find what I wanted to do - porter at my local hospital . ( This takes time so do n't leave it until the summer holidays ! ) I also started to look for GAP year medical volunteering opportunities abroad . Once I finished school , I started to volunteer at my local old people's home , 2 or 3 times a week , and I also started working for the NHS . My PS was more interesting the second time around , because I had more to write about .

The cells that make up the nervous system die at two distinct times during the lifetime of an organism . These periods of neuron loss occur during embryonic development and also during ageing . Our research focuses on the factors that determine how , when and why neurons die at these times . The earliest stage of nervous system development is termed neurulation and at this time , neurons are already dying . Using Xenopus laevis as a model we are investigating what role this loss of cells plays in determining the future anatomy and physiology of the central nervous system . We are also considerating the effects that environmental agents have on cell death during neurulation and how this might relate to the development of neural tube defects such as spina bifida . Later on in embryonic development there is a wave of cell death as neurons innervate their target fields . We are investigating the intracellular and extracellular factors that control this in several populations of murine CNS neurons . Finally we are looking at the causes of cell death in ageing and neurodegenrative diseases with emphasis placed on Parkinson's disease and Huntington's disease . Again we are interested in the intracellular and extracellular factors that control this loss of cells . In addition we are investigating factors that influence the physiology of these neurons . about linking to this page make changes to your own information </doc>",4.0

Jed Moffitt did n't expect his IT services director role for Puget Sound's King County Library System ( KCLS ) to extend to leading Agile Web-based software development projects . Yet , today , development project planning is about 30 % of his job . The journey to that point was loaded with challenges : high demand for rapid application and new feature delivery , staff resistance , the pains of being an early adopter and , of course , a tight budget . Jed Moffitt "" Since the likes of Amazon and Google have become competitors for readers , libraries have to offer Internet services to be relevant , "" said Moffitt . He had to buck library systems' history of slow changes to take the 47-branch library system relevant in a time when so much of the information libraries used to provide is going online . The decision to build and customize KCLS applications for the Web positioned Moffitt as a pioneer . "" You 'd be hard-pressed to find another public library that would go this route , "" Moffitt said . He quotes the usual reactions from his long-time colleagues around the country : "" You 're developing software ? You 've got to be kidding me ! "" A history with software leads to open source tools Necessity had pushed Moffitt into software development before . Back in 1986 , Moffitt started working on library systems , transferring old-style , paper-based card catalogs into software catalogs . "" I used dumb terminals and computers with a half a K of memory , "" he said . From there , he moved to implementing software for "" the more squishy parts of the library process , "" he said .

Building a disabled vehicle The disabled vehicle is all but invisible on the road these days because , surprise , surprise , it not only looks just like any other car , it really is like any other car ! You could n't spot it from Adam , whether travelling down the motorway or going to the doctor's surgery , or while doing the weekly shop at your local supermarket . And believe it or not , there are actually tens of thousands of wheelchair accessible vehicles on the roads of the UK on any particular day of the week . Surprised ? You should n't be . It 's been happening unnoticed by the able-bodied community for years , the conversion process which turns an ordinary car into one which a disabled person can make use of or even drive with ease . There are many companies across the country who not only do this work on a daily basis , but have been doing so for years , building a tremendous level of expertise in the process . Wheelchair accessible vehicle Let 's get one particular term out of the way right from the off . You may have come across it before – wheelchair accessible vehicle . Maybe not . It 's a bit of a mouthful , let 's face it , so it 's often shortened to the acronym WAV . It simply refers to a disabled vehicle capable of taking on board a person sitting in a wheelchair . The wheelchair user can be the actual driver of the car , because of all the adaptations available making this possible , or simply be the passenger , driven around by an able-bodied person whenever needed .

Part One , Chapter 10 When Levin went into the restaurant with Oblonsky , he could not help noticing a certain peculiarity of expression , as it were , a restrained radiance , about the face and whole figure of Stepan Arkadyevitch . Oblonsky took off his overcoat , and with his hat over one ear walked into the dining room , giving directions to the Tatar waiters , who were clustered about him in evening coats , bearing napkins . Bowing to right and left to the people he met , and here as everywhere joyously greeting acquaintances , he went up to the sideboard for a preliminary appetizer of fish and vodka , and said to the painted Frenchwoman decked in ribbons , lace , and ringlets , behind the counter , something so amusing that even that Frenchwoman was moved to genuine laughter . Levin for his part refrained from taking any vodka simply because he felt such a loathing of that Frenchwoman , all made up , it seemed , of false hair , poudre de riz , and vinaigre de toilette . He made haste to move away from her , as from a dirty place . His whole soul was filled with memories of Kitty , and there was a smile of triumph and happiness shining in his eyes . "" This way , your excellency , please . Your excellency wo n ' t be disturbed here , "" said a particularly pertinacious , white-headed old Tatar with immense hips and coat-tails gaping widely behind .

Military Provisioning Guardian 6 Recommendations . 1 : Increasing long-term federal investment in high-technology industries , particularly those involving advanced research and manufacturing capabilities . The distinguishing attribute of the U.S. defense industrial base is technological innovation . As foreign nations continue manufac ¬ turing an ever-larger share of America's defense supplies , the United States increases its risk of diminishing its capacity to design and commercialize emerging defense technologies . To help ensure that our armed forces dominate the future battlefield , Congress should provide funding for American manufacturers to develop and implement advanced process technologies . 2 : Properly applying and enforcing existing laws and regulations to support the U.S. defense industrial base . Domestic source preferences already enacted into law , such as those that apply to the steel and titanium industries under the Specialty Metals Clause , must be retained to ensure that important defense capabilities remain secure and available for the U.S. armed forces . 3 : Developing domestic sources of key natural resources required by our armed forces . Right now the United States relies far too heavily on foreign nations for certain key metals and other raw materials needed to manufacture weapons systems and other military supplies . For example , most rare earth elements , which are essential components of many modern military technologies , currently must be purchased from China . The U.S. government and industry must stockpile these vital raw materials , strengthen efforts to resume mining and transformation of the materials in the United States , improve recycling to make more efficient use of current supplies , and identify alternate materials . 4 : Developing plans to strengthen our defense industrial base in the U.S. National Military Strategy , National Security Strategy , and the Quadrennial Defense Review process",4.0

The "" Browning "" of African Technology Forget MIT . Hello , Tsing Hua University . For Clothilde Tingiri , a hot young programmer at Rwanda's top software company , dreams of Beijing , not Cambridge , animate her ambitions . Desperate for more education , this fall she plans to attend graduate school for computer science – in China , not America . The Chinese are no strangers to Rwanda . Near Tingiri's office , Rwanda's largest telecom company , Rwandatel , is installing new wireless telephony equipment made by Huawei of Shenzen . Africa boasts the world's fastest-growing market for wireless telephony , and Huawei – with offices in 14 African countries – is running away with the business , sending scores of engineers into the bush to bring a new generation of low-cost technology to some of the planet's poorest people . Motivated by profit and market share rather than philanthropy , Huawei is outpacing American and European rivals through lower prices , faster action , and a greater willingness to work in difficult environments . According to Chris Lundh , the American chief of Rwandatel , "" That 's the way things work in Africa now . The Chinese do it all . "" Well , not quite . Across sub-Saharan Africa , engineers from India – armed with appropriate technologies honed in their home market – are also making their mark . India supplies Africa with computer-education courses , the most reliable water pumps , low-cost rice-milling equipment , and dozens of other technologies . The sudden influx of Chinese and Indian technologies represents the "" browning "" of African technology , which has long been the domain of "" white "" Americans and Europeans who want to apply their saving hand to African problems",4.0

THE BRUSH ATTACHMENT The brush attachment is positioned over the top of the large drum just after the space where the two drums are the closest . It 's placed where the fiber enters the carder and is the most efficient location . The function of the brush is to : Keep fiber from flying away ( as happens with angora ) Push the fiber down into the teeth of the large drum ( hence producing a fuller loftier batt ) Assist in the carding operation by firmly brushing the fiber after it has been initially carded by the counter rotating infeed and take up drums . It almost acts like a "" third drum "" . To obtain the above in the most efficient manner , the design of the actual brush ( including length and stiffness of the bristles ) , the support brackets and the position of the brush relative to the large drum are all important . These criteria are maximized in the Strauch drum carder thereby allowing the brush attachment on these carders to efficiently handle a variety of fibers . This properly designed brush works with fibers from very coarse to very fine and long to relatively short . Some folks have "" Rube Goldberged "" brushes using a paint brush , wallpaper brush or dog combing brush . While they may work with some fibers , they will not handle all the various ones used by fiber artists . The fabulous brush attachment is now standard on all series of drum carders . </doc>",4.0

Charities – good or bad ? Seems strange , does n't it ? But a lot of charities say they would prefer not to exist – or rather that they would prefer not to have to exist . For example , if there had been no boys and girls living in poverty in 19th-century London , Dr Barnardo would not have needed to set up his children's homes . And , if there were no hunger or war in the world , there would be no need for charities like Oxfam or Comic Relief . So , charities are often best placed to provide help where there otherwise would n't be any . But not everybody thinks that highly of charities . What do you think about these three opinions ? </doc>",4.0

Tara Browne : the James Dean of Sixties London who inspired The Beatles Keiron Pim reviews a biography of the Guinness heir whose early death in a sports car crash inspired the Beatles' A Day in the Life I n Swinging London , most figures of significance inhabited one circle – art , pop , criminality or aristocracy – but intersected with others . Tara Browne was no exception . He was of the seventh generation of the Guinness brewing family : in the snobbish parlance of the upper classes , they were "" trade "" ; and in the playwright Brendan Behan's wry description , "" the only English aristocrats who have remained truly Irish "" . As an heir to the family fortune Browne had vast wealth but also a nagging doubt that his friends were attracted to him for any other reason . In one of the more memorable quotations to come from his mouth in Paul Howard 's I Heard the News Today , Oh Boy , the first full-length biography , Browne describes himself as "" a hustlee "" , but one who was content to be hustled if it helped accelerate the capital's whirl in the mid-Sixties . Tara Browne's specially painted AC Cobra on display in 1967 Credit : Martin Cook S ince that overfamiliar moment has been chronicled ad nauseam , Howard's tactic – to find a new slant on it through a minor character who influenced more famous friends – is astute . Browne's sole line in the history books to date has to do with the opening verse of the Beatles' A Day in the Life , written after he died in a car crash in Chelsea in December 1966 .

Great Famine , also called Irish Potato Famine , Great Irish Famine , or Famine of 1845 – 49 , famine that occurred in Ireland in 1845 – 49 when the potato crop failed in successive years . The crop failures were caused by late blight , a disease that destroys both the leaves and the edible roots , or tubers , of the potato plant . The causative agent of late blight is the water mold Phytophthora infestans . The Irish famine was the worst to occur in Europe in the 19th century . Famine ( 1997 ) , commemorating the Great Famine , sculpture by Rowan ... In the early 19th century , Ireland's tenant farmers as a class , especially in the west of Ireland , struggled both to provide for themselves and to supply the British market with cereal crops . Many farmers had long existed at virtually the subsistence level , given the small size of their allotments and the various hardships that the land presented for farming in some regions . The potato , which had become a staple crop in Ireland by the 18th century , was appealing in that it was a hardy , nutritious , and calorie-dense crop and relatively easy to grow in the Irish soil . By the early 1840s almost half the Irish population – but primarily the rural poor – had come to depend almost exclusively on the potato for their diet . The rest of the population also consumed it in large quantities . A heavy reliance on just one or two high-yielding types of potato greatly reduced the genetic variety that ordinarily prevents the decimation of an entire crop by disease , and thus the Irish became vulnerable to famine . In 1845 a strain",4.0

This statement comes in spite of Britain's support for the so-called ' negative security assurances ' of the Non-Proliferation Treaty to which Britain is a signatory , in which Britain promises not to attack non-nuclear weapons states with nuclear weapons . This is an appalling step in the Labour <font color = red>government</font> 's <font color = red>increasingly</font> bellicose approach to world affairs , and smacks of the <font color = red>Conservative</font> <font color = red>policies</font> of 1993 – when Malcolm Rifkind <font color = red>talked</font> of the <font color = red>possible</font> ' sub-strategic use of <font color = red>nuclear</font> weapons ' and the <font color = red>dangers</font> of ' rogue <font color = red>states</font> ' .

Artist impression of the Deep Impact flyby spacecraft releasing its impactor towards comet Tempel-1 in July 2005 . The flyby spacecraft has been re-christened EPOXI and will begin its new assignment to hunt for super-Earth exoplanets . Image : NASA . EPOXI is a combination of two separate science investigations , one consisting of the Extrasolar Planet Observations and Characterisation ( EPOCh ) and the other of the flyby of comet Hartley-2 , planned for 2010 , called the Deep Impact eXtended Investigation ( DIXI ) , which follows in the footsteps of the hugely successful Deep Impact mission in July 2005 which revealed in unprecedented detail the surface of a comet and the effects of impact into such a finely powdered surface . For the majority of May , EPOXI was trained on the red dwarf star GJ436 , 32 light years from Earth . This star has a Neptune sized planet circling it every 20 to 30 days in an unusually eccentric orbit . "" Tidal forces from the star should have made the orbit circular , unless there is another planet whose gravitational tug pulls the orbit into an oval shape , "" says Drake Deming , EPOXI's Deputy Principal Investigator . "" If that second planet lies in the same orbital plane as the Neptune-sized planet then we should see it transit . The transit would be too shallow to be spotted by ground-based telescopes , and EPOXI is the only space mission that can look at GJ436 nearly continuously for several weeks . "" Deming and his team are in the process of analysing the results of these data . In addition to targeting the red dwarf star , EPOXI imaged the Earth over three 24-hour periods , measuring its rotational light curve at visible",4.0

PDAs Bring Hand-Held Solutions to Healthcare Author Email Personal digital assistants ( PDAs ) have found a niche in the healthcare market since their inception several years ago , and today the devices give doctors and nurses a critical wireless connection to patient records and Web-based databases to aid diagnosis and treatment . PDAs are no longer just for keeping track of appointments , as hospitals and healthcare systems now integrate PDA connectivity into their computer networks to allow access to patient records . This has allowed clinicians to keep up to the minute on patient conditions and review information from tests and patient vital signs even if they are not in the hospital . Connecting PDAs to hospital systems When hospitals issue PDAs to their staffs , the key is making the information they can access meaningful with connectivity to the hospital computer networks . SOTI Inc. is one company that provides software to connect PDA devices to hospital systems and patient electronic medical records ( EMRs ) . It also allows large networks of these mobile devices to be managed remotely by hospital IT staff . Children's Mercy Hospitals and Clinics in Kansas City , MO , has issued more than 400 HP iPAQ Pocket PCs to its doctors , residents and nurse practitioners in every department . Via SOTI , clinicians can gain encrypted access to an abbreviated version of patients' EMRs to review and enter information and type in notes , look at summaries of patients' vital signs , radiology notes , lab results , and retrieve and copy previously entered patient notes to save time . "" The main reason we give the iPAQs to them is because all of our inpatient notes are now done electronically – we do n't do any writing-out of",4.0

Posted on Mar 22nd , 2011 . 768 comments Wire to Wire : Inside the 1984 Detroit Tigers Championship Season is not my book . Though in a way it is . This other Wire to Wire , written by George Cantor and published in 2004 , chronicles the magical year when the Tigers opened the season with a 19-1 record . Imagine it happening day by day . 19 wins . One loss . A few weeks later they were 35-5 . During the first quarter of that season , the Tigers were virtually unbeatable . Argue great teams all you want , but based on that win-loss record , no team in baseball has ever been that good , before or since . The Tigers won the pennant and the World Series wire to wire that year – meaning they were in first place every day of the season . Only two other teams had ever done that in over 100 years of baseball . I took that as a freaking sign . I named my book after it . ( Cantor's book , I might add , had not been written yet . ) Later , I wrote to Jesse Burkhardt about my decision to quit my job and write a book . Jesse is also Iron Legs Burk , who showed me how to hop freights . He saved the letter for a decade or two , and today he mailed it back to me . To be clear , my Wire to Wire has nothing to do with baseball . The Tigers are n't even mentioned . ( Well , actually , there 's a little play by play in the background of one scene , an argument .

Education would be so much more effective if its purpose were to ensure that by the time they leave school every boy and girl should know how much they do n't know , and be imbued with a lifelong desire to know it . Sir William Haley The degradation of love and the fallacy of reason . The following is an ongoing essay on ethics . It is not eco-ethics , see my links page , although I do maintain that we can not separate human ethics from the eco-system that is our home , this planet Earth . It is clearly time for a more holistic approach to ethics , but that is not really to address something new so much as to redress something that has been too much ignored throughout history , save by a few , to our very great cost . It is ethics that separates us from beasts . Mere labour , scientific and religious endeavor or sentiment are not of themselves enough . If we leave unexamined our motives , justice , injustice and morality we are , despite all our technical sophistication and advances , vagabonds in the face of our potential . A revolution is required , but not as we understand revolution in any historical sense . It is a personal revolution relevant to each and every one of us . It can not be enforced , only chosen . </doc>",4.0

In Love ' Em or Lose ' Em , the authors persuasively argue that the ever-increasing "" race for talent "" can be effectively won only by those who adopt a mindset and behaviors that truly support their employees . They then describe how to do so , with a focus on the important role that managers play .

Within the UK , Scotland has unique access legislation , with a right of responsible access to almost all land and inland water , as defined in the Land Reform ( Scotland ) Act 2003 . This includes woodland . There is an access code that helps define access rights for users and land managers , all explained in detail on the outdoor access web site . However although people have a right of responsible access to all woodland areas in Scotland this does not mean that there will be an obvious entrance , paths or other access facilities available nor that the woodland condition and environment will make people feel welcome . For this reason the Woodland Trust Scotland and Forestry Commission Scotland have formed an agreed definition of accessible woodland for the Scottish context . Accessible woodland is defined as woods having at least : An entrance , a useable path , track or forest road as well as access that is welcoming .

3 July 2003 CHILDREN DEPRIVED OF SPACE FOR ART , NEW REPORT FINDS The Clore Duffield Foundation publishes today Space for Art , the final report and recommendations based on a two year study of art-making and exploration spaces in schools , galleries and museums throughout the UK , on Children's Art Day , Thursday 3 July . Space for Art is a practical handbook for teachers and educators in galleries and museums , to help them fight for the kind of creative spaces they need . It highlights the lack of resources and attention to detail given to art-education spaces , with senior management and architects still failing to understand the practical requirements of such spaces . Sally Bacon , Director of the Clore Duffield Foundation , comments : "" I have been led round tiny spaces and been informed that a full class - in excess of 30 children - could work within them quite happily . Architects' drawings sometimes blithely reinforce this impossibility . We want gallery and museum staff to have some clear guidance on dimensions to prevent this state of affairs from carrying on . "" Space for Art explores the full range of issues surrounding such spaces , from the development process and working with architects to location and dimensions , storage and display , usage and management and services . Attention to detail and practical considerations are central to the success , or failure , of spaces . Too many educators have to fight for the basics : "" One room gained black-out facilities this summer , the other one still has n ' t ( 8 years of asking ) . "" Even temperature control is not a given : "" The children work with their coats on due to the cold",4.0

The project for the U.S. <font color = purple>Forces</font> is one of 31 approved <font color = purple>elapsed</font> <font color = purple>days</font> by DoD's Multidisciplinary Research Initiative ( MURI ) program , a $ 146 million , five-year effort targeting topics of "" exceptional opportunity "" for DoD technologies and applications . "" MURI topics have very aggressive technical goals for objectives that can not be accomplished with existing technologies , "" <font color = purple>stating</font> James Zeidler , principal investigator on the project and a research scientist and senior lecturer in the Electrical and Computer Engineering department of UCSD's Jacobs School of Engineering . "" We are developing some fundamentally new concepts and approaches , and it will be a very exciting project . "" Ad-hoc networks form when communications peers find each other without the benefit of centralized network control systems . Deployment is vastly more complicated in fluid tactical situations where special challenges emerge , and where the price of dropped communications can mean loss of life and mission failure . Among the difficulties : peers must stay in touch while having to move around , maintain stealth , and avoid enemy jamming and eaves-dropping attempts . The network must sustain itself when communications partners go out of range or are damaged or destroyed . Noted",4.0
