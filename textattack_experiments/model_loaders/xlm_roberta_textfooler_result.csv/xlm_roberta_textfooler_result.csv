In Light Sentence ( 1992 ) , meanwhile , another naked bulb dangles amidst an enclosure of metal-mesh lockers , its mechanical pivoting sending grids of shadows skittering and stretching about the gallery walls , creating a disorientating , vaguely sickening effect . Such works must be among the most instantly familiar in recent British art , but are no less thrillingly effective for that . Less well known , though , and where this retrospective really comes into its own , are Hatoum's early performance pieces .","Skipped"

8.0,1.0,0.0,0.8360984921455383,"Scrap the education white paper Stop all the academies and defend comprehensive education by Ken Muller , assistant secretary Islington NUT ( pc ) Far more is at stake for the future of education than the fate of the hapless Ruth Kelly . New Labour's White Paper on schools signals a thoroughgoing assault on the principle of comprehensive education . The planned education bill based on it would lead to all schools being encouraged to break from local democratic control and turn themselves into semi-independent trusts . Such is the scale of the mounting opposition that the government now appears to fear that it will be able to get the bill through parliament only by relying on Tory votes . Senior New Labour figures said this week that Tony Blair is looking to delay publishing the bill , which was due next month , until he has been able to buy off backbench opposition .

New Labour's White Paper on schools signals a thoroughgoing assault on the principle of comprehensive education . The planned education bill based on it would lead to all schools being encouraged to break from local democratic control and turn themselves into semi-independent trusts . Such is the scale of the mounting opposition that the government now appears to fear that it will be able to get the bill through parliament only by relying on Tory votes . Senior New Labour figures said this week that Tony Blair is looking to delay publishing the bill , which was due next month , until he has been able to buy off backbench opposition .

There 's the left half , which is the logical side , and then the right half , which is the intuitive . And so if we had a scale to measure the aptitude of each hemisphere , then we can plot our brain . And for example , this would be somebody who 's completely logical . This would be someone who 's entirely intuitive . So where would you put your brain on this scale ? Some of us may have opted for one of these extremes , but I think for most people in the audience , your brain is something like this -- with a high aptitude in both hemispheres at the same time . It 's not like they 're mutually exclusive or anything . You can be logical and intuitive . And so I consider myself one of these people , along with most of the other experimental quantum physicists , who need a good deal of logic to string together these complex ideas . But at the same time , we need a good deal of intuition to actually make the experiments work . How do we develop this intuition ? Well we like to play with stuff . So we go out and play with it , and then we see how it acts . And then we develop our intuition from there . And really you do the same thing .

Mr Gilbert dines at the Modern Hindu Hotel for descant recorder and piano was composed in 1994 to celebrate composer Anthony Gilbert's 60th birthday . Lasting a little under three minutes and certainly an occasional piece , it is nevertheless a significant work , exploring textures and sonorities found also in Rite in A Book of Song and Dance composed at around the same time . His Master's Voice for sopranino recorder and piano was written in 2001 for Walker's composition teacher David Lumsdain on his 70th birthday . It proceeds in alternate calm and energetic sections that achieve further contrast by setting the recorder very effectively against the piano's higher and lower registers . This and the above are two recorder works striking in their originality that leave you eager to hear more of walker's work for the instrument . His years as a chorister in York Minster under the direction of Francis Jackson clearly gave Walker a strong sense of organ sonorities that is very evident in two impressive works for the instrument , Dances with Chant and Chorales and Invention .

Mr Gilbert dines at the Modern Hindu Hotel for descant recorder and piano was composed in 1994 to celebrate composer Anthony Gilbert's 60th birthday . Lasting a little under three minutes and certainly an occasional piece , it is nevertheless a significant work , exploring textures and sonorities found also in Rite in A Book of Song and Dance composed at around the same time . His Master's Voice for sopranino recorder and piano was written in 2001 for Walker's composition teacher David Lumsdain on his 70th birthday . It proceeds in alternate calm and energetic sections that achieve further contrast by setting the recorder very effectively against the piano's higher and lower registers . This and the above are two recorder works striking in their originality that leave you eager to hear more of walker's work for the instrument . His years as a chorister in York Minster under the direction of Francis Jackson clearly gave Walker a strong sense of organ sonorities that is very evident in two impressive works for the instrument , Dances with Chant and Chorales and Invention . The earliest composition on the disc is Dance / Still for the unusual ensemble of flute , clarinet , violin , cello , guitar and percussion ( two players ) written in 1982 .

The Students Face Up curriculum , in keeping with the nature of the federal budget crisis - which can only be solved by citizens talking to each other about the choices we face - is open-source to the extent that both students and faculty members can submit papers , videos , podcasts , PowerPoint presentations , and URLs of additional resources to enhance our core Students Face Up student and teacher curriculum materials . Professors have a choice of many ways to use the contest , including as a class assignment , an exam , or independent study for extra credit . Two winners are chosen by our judges ; and two are chosen by site users , in a popular vote , with four prizes of $ 500 each . In other words , it 's a reality show ( we 're not calling it Dancing With The Deficit , but , that 's the general idea ) that students can enter right here on their PCs . Registered users of the site are able to vote online and comment on entries","Skipped"

2.0,1.0,5.0,0.7192763090133667,"Eben Sadie : winery profile by Richard Kelley MW It is fitting that Eben ' surfer-philosopher ' Sadie should name his wine after Lucius Junius Moderatus Columella , author of ' De Rustica ' ( ' On Country Matters ' ) , the most comprehensive account of Roman viticulture that dates back two millennia . The wine itself comes from seven different , unirrigated , fully controlled leased parcels across 52km of the Swartland . The area has a remarkably stable climate , allowing for consistent quality albeit with vintage variation . The distinction of Columella is derived from its terroir , the character of the vintage and a very hands off winemaking approach ( more time for surfing , or jetting off to Spain to prune vineyards , or to rack wine in his Priorato venture ) . Columella is primarily Syrah with 10 % Mourvèdre ( in 2000 ) . Five of the seven parcels are planted with bushvines and each site reflects a different soil profile , encompassing slate ( at Porcelain Mountain ) , coffee stone , an iron rich soil ( Rheeboksfontein ) , and granite ( Aprilskloof ) . To say selection is rigorous is an understatement . The vines are pruned to allow for around 25 hl / ha so as to encourage full phenolic maturity .

The wine itself comes from seven different , unirrigated , fully controlled leased parcels across 52km of the Swartland . The area has a remarkably stable climate , allowing for consistent quality albeit with vintage variation . The distinction of Columella is derived from its terroir , the character of the vintage and a very hands off winemaking approach ( more time for surfing , or jetting off to Spain to prune vineyards , or to rack wine in his Priorato venture ) . Columella is primarily Syrah with 10 % Mourvèdre ( in 2000 ) . Five of the seven parcels are planted with bushvines and each site reflects a different soil profile , encompassing slate ( at Porcelain Mountain ) , coffee stone , an iron rich soil ( Rheeboksfontein ) , and granite ( Aprilskloof ) . To say selection is rigorous is an understatement . The vines are pruned to allow for around 25 hl / ha so as to encourage full phenolic maturity .

7.0,1.0,0.0,0.9952235221862793,"This declaration is heard daily across the land from first-time entrepreneurs . To the uninitiated it sounds impressive and even glamorous to embark on such a path . However , to veteran entrepreneurs it 's a strong indication of the rookie's naivety and lack of understanding of the consequences of accepting money from outsiders . While venture capital can be a tremendous boon to a tiny fraction of the companies pursuing it , in the vast majority of cases it presents the entrepreneur with a "" Faustian Bargain "" . Venture capital brings with it tremendous meddling and pressure from venture capitalists who in this day and age typically lack both the operating and industry depth of their predecessors . The effect of this on fledgling ventures is loss of control by the entrepreneur which then frequently leads to bad--and sometimes fatal--business decisions being made . Here are ten drawbacks of venture capital for the entrepreneur to mull over before making a decision to pursue it . The decision to chase venture capital is often a tempting distraction from the much more complex and important entrepreneurial tasks of creating something to sell and persuading someone to buy it . The pursuit of venture capital is sometimes a means by which to postpone the day of reckoning when the marketplace finally decides if the idea will fly .

Once negotiations begin venture capitalists will typically stall in order to push cash short companies to the brink",0.0,0.9952235221862793,"This declaration is heard daily across the land from first-time entrepreneurs . To the uninitiated it sounds impressive and even glamorous to embark on such a path . However , to veteran entrepreneurs it 's a strong indication of the rookie's naivety and lack of understanding of the consequences of accepting money from outsiders . While venture capital can be a tremendous boon to a tiny fraction of the companies pursuing it , in the vast majority of cases it presents the entrepreneur with a "" Faustian Bargain "" . Venture capital brings with it tremendous meddling and pressure from venture capitalists who in this day and age typically lack both the operating and industry depth of their predecessors . The effect of this on fledgling ventures is loss of control by the entrepreneur which then frequently leads to bad--and sometimes fatal--business decisions being made . Here are ten drawbacks of venture capital for the entrepreneur to mull over before making a decision to pursue it . The decision to chase venture capital is often a tempting distraction from the much more complex and important entrepreneurial tasks of creating something to sell and persuading someone to buy it . The pursuit of venture capital is sometimes a means by which to postpone the day of reckoning when the marketplace finally decides if the idea will fly . Venture capitalists behave like sheep investing only in whatever industry happens to be the flavor of the month . Everyone else need not apply .

' It totally recognises the right of parents to educate the children at home , it totally recognises the fact that they do n't have to follow official curriculum , it totally recognises that parents do n't have to have formal teaching qualifications . ' ' What it does say is that all children should be monitored and they should be monitored to make sure that they are receiving a balanced and wide education so that you do n't get somebody who 's only teaching them about one particular topic for example . ' Ms Gillespie admitted that the home educators were ' very angry ' about the checks . Steve Stanford of the group ' Education Otherwise ' who teaches his own children at home has pointed out that the home educators receive no resources from the education system whatsoever and so he believes it is understandable that parents find the checks intrusive .","Skipped"

Answer : Hardly anybody noticed it , but Congress tucked away a valuable bit of holiday cheer for real estate when it passed its final tax bill of the year . It was the first substantive change in years to the generous capital gains rules governing sales of principal homes . According to Kenneth Harney , most homeowners and real estate professionals can recite these rules in their sleep : Married , joint-filing sellers of houses can exclude up to $ 500 , 000 of gain , and single-filing sellers can take up to $ 250 , 000 ... provided they 've used the property as a principal residence for a cumulative two of the previous five years . But what happens when a married home owner dies ? Does the surviving spouse still qualify for the full $ 500 , 000 -- or does she or he only get to exclude $ 250 , 000 ?

Costa gave way to young Martin Dickinson , and it was Martin's strong run and magnificent left foot strike that sealed the victory 3-0 after 69 minutes .
