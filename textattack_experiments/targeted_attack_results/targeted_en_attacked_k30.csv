31,1.0,A7,A16,"What is a relational database ? A relational database consists of two or more tables whose records are related to each other . The relationship is created by linking a field in one table with a field in another table . Both these fields must be exactly the same datatype . In one of the tables it must be a Primary Key . Key fields are the heart of relational database management . The value in a key field uniquely identifies a particular occurrence of a given record type .

37,2.0,A14,A17,"We 're 25 , 26 years after the advent of the Macintosh , which was an astoundingly seminal event in the history of human-machine interface , and in computation in general . It fundamentally changed the way that people thought about computation , thought about computers , how they used them and who and how many people were able to use them . It was such a radical change , in fact , that the early Macintosh development team in ' 82 , ' 83 , ' 84 , had to write an entirely new operating system from the ground up . Now , this is an interesting little message , and it 's a lesson that has since , I think , been forgotten or lost or something . And that is , namely , that the OS is the interface . The interface is the OS . It 's like the land and the king ( i . e . Arthur ) they 're inseparable , they are one . And to write a new operating system was not a capricious matter . It was n ' t just a matter of tuning up some graphics routines . There were no graphics routines . There were no mouse drivers . So it was a necessity . But in the quarter century since then , we 've seen all of the fundamental supporting technologies go berserk .

It fundamentally changed the way that people thought about computation , thought about computers , how they used them and who and how many people were able to use them . It was such a radical change , in fact , that the early Vxworks development team in ' 82 , ' 83 , ' 84 , had to write an entirely new operating system from the ground up . Now , this is an interesting little message , and it 's a lesson that has since , I think , been forgotten or lost or something . And that is , namely , that the OS is the interface . The interface is the OS . It 's like the land and the king ( i . e . Arthur ) they 're inseparable , they are one . And to write a new operating system was not a capricious matter . It was n ' t just a matter of tuning up some graphics routines . There were no graphics routines . There were no mouse drivers . So it was a necessity . But in the quarter century since then , we 've seen all of the fundamental supporting technologies go berserk .

39,6.0,A14,A7," In producing a signlist and analysing its contents , it is obviously very important to consider the question of what actually constitutes a "" sign "" . Much has changed since the traditional Assyriological signlists were first produced , both in Assyriology and in the description and analysis of writing and writing systems in general . The minimal unit of written language - and this applies equally to logo-syllabic scripts such as cuneiform as it does to alphabetic scripts - is the grapheme . One  might  describe this as the smallest contrastive unit of writing . By substituting one such unit for another , a significant change in meaning ( using the term in its broad sense ) occurs . Grapheme is not an unproblematic term ( notice , for instance , that there is no one-to-one relationship between graphemes and phonemes ) but it is both defensible and useful , as far as the present study of cuneiform is concerned , at least . There are many and various indications of what ancient scribes considered units in cuneiform ; in light of these , a set of criteria is being drawn up to allow the identification of signs . The CDP project will catalogue and analyse these units , these graphemes . Thus for the signlist , the sign is a grapheme . There are two further levels at which cuneiform signs can be described . Graphemes may appear in several different , yet equally valid , forms ; these are labelled allographs .

66,52.0,A16,A17," Orpheus  Gustave Moreau drew much  attention when he painted Orpheus in 1865 . The intriguing  composition regards the  famous  Greek legend of Orpheus , a poet and musician so talented that he  was believed to be able to charm beasts into submission . Moreau , known for his wild imagination , created a unique  ending  to  the myth , and depicted it on  canvas . The story goes that when  Orpheus charmed the maenads , ( seductive female followers of  the  god of wine ) , and  then refused their advances , they tore him  apart  and threw his head and lyre into a nearby stream . While most artists chose to paint  the horrific events of the raging women murdering Orpheus , Gustave Moreau opted to depict his personal idea of what happened after the tragic slaying . He includes a young  girl dressed in delicate oriental garments who , after having salvaged Orpheuss decapitated head and lyre from the stream , lovingly  stares at it with a sad facial expression that could signify regret or pity . The similarity of the two faces not only captivates viewers with its eeriness , but it also has them questioning the artists intention .

So what do you think ? Is this  the face of Leonardo da Vinci or is n't it ? Let 's find out . Leonardo was  a  man that drew everything  around  him .

Well , for that they have to be done as we just saw , en face or three-quarters . So we can eliminate all the profiles . It also has to be sufficiently detailed .

The first scandal occurred last year , after  a tractor filled with green onions scraped the side of a  BMW  in Harbin . The drivers of both the tractor and the metallic-silver luxury car were 45-year-old women , but any similarity between them ended there : the former was a peasant , the latter the wife of a wealthy businessman . After a confrontation between the two , the wealthy wife drove her BMW into the growing crowd of spectators on the roadside , killing the peasant woman and injuring 12 others . The case went to the local court , where the judge ruled it an "" accidental traffic disturbance "" and gave the driver a two-year suspended sentence . The judge's ruling spurred rumors that he went easy on her because her husband was related to senior provincial officials . It quickly became a story of "" rich versus poor , "" widely cited as an example of high-level corruption . Over the next few months , newspapers and television stations ran with the story as it snowballed into a national obsession . Alarmed by the public reaction , the Harbin magistrate ordered the case reopened , only to have the suspended sentence confirmed when the case was closed this March .

The drivers of both the tractor and the metallic-silver luxury car were 45-year-old women , but any similarity between them ended there : the former was a peasant , the latter the wife of a wealthy businessman . Subsequently a mistrusting between the both , the wealthy wife drove her NISMO into the growing crowd of spectators on the roadside , killing the peasant woman and injuring 12 others . The case went to the local court , where the judicial ruled it an "" accidental traffic disturbance "" and gave the driving a two-year suspended convicted . The judge's ruling spurred rumors that he went easy on her because her husband was related to senior provincial officials . It quickly became a story of "" rich versus poor , "" widely cited as an example of high-level corruption . Over the next few months , newspapers and television stations ran with the story as it snowballed into a national obsession . Alarmed by the public reaction , the Harbin magistrate ordered the case reopened , only to have the suspended sentence confirmed when the case was closed this March . The big BMW story of late 2003 resurfaced quietly , before being buried again forever . That same month , a lottery scandal threw the BMW brand into the limelight once again .

The wine itself comes from seven different , unirrigated , fully controlled leased parcels across 52km of the Swartland .

Columella is primarily Syrah with 10 % Mourvèdre ( in 2000 ) .

Popular movements have brought a range of avowedly Islamist political parties  to  power , replacing  the largely secular former regimes . What that will mean for these  countries , and for the region , is  one  of today's central geopolitical questions . In  North  Africa , two Islamist parties have come fully to power  via  democratic elections : al-Nahda ( Renaissance ) in Tunisia , where the Arab Spring began , and  the Justice and  Development Party ( PJD ) in Morocco , both of which now lead new coalition governments .

Besides being 100 % recyclable and reusable , the steel used in prefabricated steel buildings can contribute toward several other LEED credits , either directly or indirectly . For instance , steel buildings , which are designed through the use of revolutionary engineering and technology , are weather tight and have superior structural integrity .

The House , she said , could take up the sea-level-rise bill this  week and vote not to accept the measure as it recently passed the Senate . If the House votes not to concur with the Senate version , it would put the issue in front of a conference committee of House and Senate members . There , McElraft  said , the plan is to place a moratorium on using accelerated rates of sea-level rise in writing coastal development policies while the state studies the issue .

The House , she say , ought take up the sea-level-rise bill that  months and vote not to accept the measure as it recently passed the Senate . If the House votes not to concur with the Senate version , it would put the issue in front of a conference committee of House and Senate members . There , rucker  retorted , the plan is to place a moratorium on using accelerated rates of sea-level rise in writing coastal development policies while the state studies the issue . McElraft said a study , which would be conducted at least in part by the Coastal Resources Commission , should look at all of the available science on the issue , "" not just one model like the Science Panel looked at . "" "" We need to look at this more scientifically and not with a political agenda , "" McElraft said . As it passed the Senate , the bill would prohibit state agencies from using projections of accelerated sea-level rise – mainly from global warming and the melting of polar ice caps – in drafting coastal development rules . Instead they would have to use only historical sea-level-rise data . The historic rates of rise are much lower than many scientists believe the seas will rise in the future .
