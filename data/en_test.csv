64,A4,"THE PURLOINED LETTER . -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Nil sapientiae odiosius acumine nimio . Seneca . At Paris , just after dark one gusty evening in the autumn of 18 – , I was enjoying the twofold luxury of meditation and a meerschaum , in company with my friend C. Auguste Dupin , in his little back library , or book-closet , au troisiême , No. 33 , Rue Dunôt , Faubourg St. Germain . For one hour at least we had maintained a profound silence ; while each , to any casual observer , might have seemed intently and exclusively occupied with the curling eddies of smoke that oppressed the atmosphere of the chamber . For myself , however , I was mentally discussing certain topics which had formed matter for conversation between us at an earlier period of the evening ; I mean the affair of the Rue Morgue , and the mystery attending the murder of Marie Rogêt . I looked upon it , therefore , as something of a coincidence , when the door of our apartment was thrown open and admitted our old acquaintance , Monsieur G – – , the Prefect of the Parisian police . We gave him a hearty welcome ; for there was nearly half as much of the entertaining as of the contemptible about the man , and we had not seen him for several years . We had been sitting in the dark , and Dupin now arose for the purpose of lighting a lamp , but sat down again , without doing so , upon G. ' s saying that he had called to consult us , or rather to ask the opinion of my friend , about some official business which had occasioned a great deal of trouble . "" If it is any point requiring reflection , "" observed Dupin , as he forebore to enkindle the wick , "" we shall examine it to better purpose in the dark . "" "" That is another of your odd notions , "" said the Prefect , who had a fashion of calling every thing "" odd "" that was beyond his comprehension , and thus lived amid an absolute legion of "" oddities . "" "" Very true , "" said Dupin , as he supplied his visiter with a pipe , and rolled towards him a comfortable chair . "" And what is the difficulty now ? "" I asked . "" Nothing more in the assassination way , I hope ? "" "" Oh no ; nothing of that nature . The fact is , the business is very simple indeed , and I make no doubt that we can manage it sufficiently well ourselves ; but then I thought Dupin would like to hear the details of it , because it is so excessively odd . "" "" Simple and odd , "" said Dupin . "" Why , yes ; and not exactly that , either . The fact is , we have all been a good deal puzzled because the affair is so simple , and yet baffles us altogether . "" "" Perhaps it is the very simplicity of the thing which puts you at fault , "" said my friend . "" What nonsense you do talk ! "" replied the Prefect , laughing heartily . "" Perhaps the mystery is a little too plain , "" said Dupin . "" Oh , good heavens ! who ever heard of such an idea ? "" "" A little too self evident . "" "" Ha ! ha ! ha ! – ha ! ha ! ha ! – ho ! ho ! ho ! "" roared our visiter , profoundly amused , "" oh , Dupin , you will be the death of me yet ! "" "" And what , after all , is the matter on hand ? "" I asked . "" Why , I will tell you , "" replied the Prefect , as he gave a long , steady and contemplative puff , and settled himself in his chair . "" I will tell you in a few words ; but , before I begin , let me caution you that this is an affair demanding the greatest secrecy , and that I should most probably lose the position I now hold , were it known that I confided it to any one . "" "" Proceed , "" said I. "" Or not , "" said Dupin . "" Well , then ; I have received personal information , from a very high quarter , that a certain document of the last importance , has been purloined from the royal apartments . The individual who purloined it is known ; this beyond a doubt ; he was seen to take it . It is known , also , that it still remains in his possession . "" "" How is this known ? "" asked Dupin . "" It is clearly inferred , "" replied the Prefect , "" from the nature of the document , and from the non-appearance of certain results which would at once arise from its passing out of the robber's possession ; – that is to say , from his employing it as he must design in the end to employ it . "" "" Be a little more explicit , "" I said . "" Well , I may venture so far as to say that the paper gives its holder a certain power in a certain quarter where such power is immensely valuable . "" The Prefect was fond of the cant of diplomacy . "" Still I do not quite understand , "" said Dupin . "" No ? Well ; the disclosure of the document to a third person , who shall be nameless , would bring in question the honor of a personage of most exalted station ; and this fact gives the holder of the document an ascendancy over the illustrious personage whose honor and peace are so jeopardized . "" "" But this ascendancy , "" I interposed , "" would depend upon the robber's knowledge of the loser's knowledge of the robber . Who would dare – "" "" The thief , "" said G. , "" is the Minister D – – , who dares all things , those unbecoming as well as those becoming a man . The method of the theft was not less ingenious than bold . The document in question – a letter , to be frank – had been received by the personage robbed while alone in the royal boudoir . During its perusal she was suddenly interrupted by the entrance of the other exalted personage from whom especially it was her wish to conceal it . After a hurried and vain endeavor to thrust it in a drawer , she was forced to place it , open as it was , upon a table . The address , however , was uppermost , and , the contents thus unexposed , the letter escaped notice . At this juncture enters the Minister D – – . His lynx eye immediately perceives the paper , recognises the handwriting of the address , observes the confusion of the personage addressed , and fathoms her secret . After some business transactions , hurried through in his ordinary manner , he produces a letter somewhat similar to the one in question , opens it , pretends to read it , and then places it in close juxtaposition to the other . Again he converses , for some fifteen minutes , upon the public affairs . At length , in taking leave , he takes also from the table the letter to which he had no claim . Its rightful owner saw , but , of course , dared not call attention to the act , in the presence of the third personage who stood at her elbow . The minister decamped ; leaving his own letter – one of no importance – upon the table . "" "" Here , then , "" said Dupin to me , "" you have precisely what you demand to make the ascendancy complete – the robber's knowledge of the loser's knowledge of the robber . "" "" Yes , "" replied the Prefect ; "" and the power thus attained has , for some months past , been wielded , for political purposes , to a very dangerous extent . The personage robbed is more thoroughly convinced , every day , of the necessity of reclaiming her letter . But this , of course , can not be done openly . In fine , driven to despair , she has committed the matter to me . "" "" Than whom , "" said Dupin , amid a perfect whirlwind of smoke , "" no more sagacious agent could , I suppose , be desired , or even imagined . "" "" You flatter me , "" replied the Prefect ; "" but it is possible that some such opinion may have been entertained . "" "" It is clear , "" said I , "" as you observe , that the letter is still in possession of the minister ; since it is this possession , and not any employment of the letter , which bestows the power . With the employment the power departs . "" "" True , "" said G. ; "" and upon this conviction I proceeded . My first care was to make thorough search of the minister's hotel ; and here my chief embarrassment lay in the necessity of searching without his knowledge . Beyond all things , I have been warned of the danger which would result from giving him reason to suspect our design . "" "" But , "" said I , "" you are quite au fait in these investigations . The Parisian police have done this thing often before . "" "" O yes ; and for this reason I did not despair . The habits of the minister gave me , too , a great advantage . He is frequently absent from home all night . His servants are by no means numerous . They sleep at a distance from their master's apartment , and , being chiefly Neapolitans , are readily made drunk . I have keys , as you know , with which I can open any chamber or cabinet in Paris . For three months a night has not passed , during the greater part of which I have not been engaged , personally , in ransacking the D – – Hotel . My honor is interested , and , to mention a great secret , the reward is enormous . So I did not abandon the search until I had become fully satisfied that the thief is a more astute man than myself . I fancy that I have investigated every nook and corner of the premises in which it is possible that the paper can be concealed . "" "" But is it not possible , "" I suggested , "" that although the letter may be in possession of the minister , as it unquestionably is , he may have concealed it elsewhere than upon his own premises ? "" "" This is barely possible , "" said Dupin . "" The present peculiar condition of affairs at court , and especially of those intrigues in which D – – is known to be involved , would render the instant availability of the document – its susceptibility of being produced at a moment's notice – a point of nearly equal importance with its possession . "" "" Its susceptibility of being produced ? "" said I. "" That is to say , of being destroyed , "" said Dupin . "" True , "" I observed ; "" the paper is clearly then upon the premises . As for its being upon the person of the minister , we may consider that as out of the question . "" "" Entirely , "" said the Prefect . "" He has been twice waylaid , as if by footpads , and his person rigorously searched under my own inspection . "" "" You might have spared yourself this trouble , "" said Dupin . "" D – – , I presume , is not altogether a fool , and , if not , must have anticipated these waylayings , as a matter of course . "" "" Not altogether a fool , "" said G. , "" but then he 's a poet , which I take to be only one remove from a fool . "" "" True , "" said Dupin , after a long and thoughtful whiff from his meerschaum , "" although I have been guilty of certain doggrel myself . "" "" Suppose you detail , "" said I , "" the particulars of your search . "" "" Why the fact is , we took our time , and we searched every where . I have had long experience in these affairs . I took the entire building , room by room ; devoting the nights of a whole week to each . We examined , first , the furniture of each apartment . We opened every possible drawer ; and I presume you know that , to a properly trained police agent , such a thing as a secret drawer is impossible . Any man is a dolt who permits a ' secret ' drawer to escape him in a search of this kind . The thing is so plain . There is a certain amount of bulk – of space – to be accounted for in every cabinet . Then we have accurate rules . The fiftieth part of a line could not escape us . After the cabinets we took the chairs . The cushions we probed with the fine long needles you have seen me employ . From the tables we removed the tops . "" "" Why so ? "" "" Sometimes the top of a table , or other similarly arranged piece of furniture , is removed by the person wishing to conceal an article ; then the leg is excavated , the article deposited within the cavity , and the top replaced . The bottoms and tops of bedposts are employed in the same way . "" "" But could not the cavity be detected by sounding ? "" I asked . "" By no means , if , when the article is deposited , a sufficient wadding of cotton be placed around it . Besides , in our case , we were obliged to proceed without noise . "" "" But you could not have removed – you could not have taken to pieces all articles of furniture in which it would have been possible to make a deposit in the manner you mention . A letter may be compressed into a thin spiral roll , not differing much in shape or bulk from a large knitting needle , and in this form it might be inserted into the rung of a chair , for example . You did not take to pieces all the chairs ? "" "" Certainly not ; but we did better – we examined the rungs of every chair in the hotel , and , indeed the jointings of every description of furniture , by the aid of a most powerful microscope . Had there been any traces of recent disturbance we should not have failed to detect it instantly . A single grain of gimlet dust , for example , would have been as obvious as an apple . Any disorder in the glueing – any unusual gaping in the joints – would have sufficed to insure detection . "" "" I presume you looked to the mirrors , between the boards and the plates , and you probed the beds and the bed clothes , as well as the curtains and carpets . "" "" That of course ; and when we had absolutely completed every particle of the furniture in this way , then we examined the house itself . We divided its entire surface into compartments , which we numbered , so that none might be missed ; then we scrutinized each individual square inch throughout the premises , including the two houses immediately adjoining , with the microscope , as before . "" "" The two houses adjoining ! "" I exclaimed ; "" you must have had a great deal of trouble . "" "" We had ; but the reward offered is prodigious ! "" "" You include the grounds about the houses ? "" "" All the grounds are paved with brick . They gave us comparatively little trouble . We examined the moss between the bricks , and found it undisturbed . "" "" You looked among D –– ' s papers , of course , and into the books of the library ? "" "" Certainly ; we opened every package and parcel ; we not only opened every book , but we turned over every leaf in each volume , not contenting ourselves with a mere shake , according to the fashion of some of our police officers . We also measured the thickness of every book cover , with the most accurate admeasurement , and applied to each the most jealous scrutiny of the microscope . Had any of the bindings been recently meddled with , it would have been utterly impossible that the fact should have escaped observation . Some five or six volumes , just from the hands of the binder , we carefully probed , longitudinally , with the needles . "" "" You explored the floors beneath the carpets ? "" "" Beyond doubt . We removed every carpet , and examined the boards with the microscope . "" "" And the paper on the walls ? "" "" Yes . "" "" You looked into the cellars ? "" "" We did . "" "" Then , "" I said , "" you have been making a miscalculation , and the letter is not upon the premises , as you suppose . "" "" I fear you are right there , "" said the Prefect . "" And now , Dupin , what would you advise me to do ? "" "" To make a thorough re-search of the premises . "" "" That is absolutely needless , "" replied G – – . "" I am not more sure that I breathe than I am that the letter is not at the Hotel . "" "" I have no better advice to give you , "" said Dupin . "" You have , of course , an accurate description of the letter ? "" "" Oh yes ! "" – And here the Prefect , producing a memorandum book proceeded to read aloud a minute account of the internal , and especially of the external appearance of the missing document . Soon after finishing the perusal of this description , he took his departure , more entirely depressed in spirits than I had ever known the good gentleman before . In about a month afterwards he paid us another visit , and found us occupied very nearly as before . He took a pipe and a chair and entered into some ordinary conversation . At length I said , – "" Well , but G – – , what of the purloined letter ? I presume you have at last made up your mind that there is no such thing as overreaching the Minister ? "" "" Confound him , say I – yes ; I made the re-examination , however , as Dupin suggested-but it was all labor lost , as I knew it would be . "" "" How much was the reward offered , did you say ? "" asked Dupin . "" Why , a very great deal – a very liberal reward – I do n't like to say how much , precisely ; but one thing I will say , that I would n ' t mind giving my individual check for fifty thousand francs to any one who could obtain me that letter . The fact is , it is becoming of more and more importance every day ; and the reward has been lately doubled . If it were trebled , however , I could do no more than I have done . "" "" Why , yes , "" said Dupin , drawlingly , between the whiffs of his meerschaum , "" I really-think , G – , you have not exerted yourself – to the utmost in this matter . You might – do a little more , I think , eh ? "" "" How ? – in what way ? ' "" Why – puff , puff – you might – puff , puff – employ counsel in the matter , eh ? – puff , puff , puff . Do you remember the story they tell of Abernethy ? "" "" No ; hang Abernethy ! "" "" To be sure ! hang him and welcome . But , once upon a time , a certain rich miser conceived the design of spunging upon this Abernethy for a medical opinion . Getting up , for this purpose , an ordinary conversation in a private company , he insinuated his case to the physician , as that of an imaginary individual . "" ' We will suppose , ' said the miser , ' that his symptoms are such and such ; now , doctor , what would you have directed him to take ? ' "" ' Take ! ' said Abernethy , ' why , take advice , to be sure . ' "" "" But , "" said the Prefect , a little discomposed , "" I am perfectly willing to take advice , and to pay for it . I would really give fifty thousand francs to any one who would aid me in the matter . "" "" In that case , "" replied Dupin , opening a drawer , and producing a check book , "" you may as well fill me up a check for the amount mentioned . When you have signed it , I will hand you the letter . "" I was astounded . The Prefect appeared absolutely thunder stricken . For some minutes he remained speechless and motionless , looking incredulously at my friend with open mouth , and eyes that seemed starting from their sockets ; then , apparently recovering himself in some measure , he seized a pen , and after several pauses and vacant stares , finally filled up and signed a check for fifty thousand francs , and handed it across the table to Dupin . The latter examined it carefully and deposited it in his pocket book ; then , unlocking an escritoire , took thence a letter and gave it to the Prefect . This functionary grasped it in a perfect agony of joy , opened it with a trembling hand , cast a rapid glance at its contents , and then , scrambling and struggling to the door , rushed at length unceremoniously from the room and from the house , without having uttered a syllable since Dupin had requested him to fill up the check . When he had gone , my friend entered into some explanations . "" The Parisian police , "" he said , "" are exceedingly able in their way . They are persevering , ingenious , cunning , and thoroughly versed in the knowledge which their duties seem chiefly to demand . Thus , when G – – detailed to us his mode of searching the premises at the Hotel D – – , I felt entire confidence in his having made a satisfactory investigation – so far as his labors extended . "" "" So far as his labors extended ? "" said I. "" Yes , "" said Dupin . "" The measures adopted were not only the best of their kind , but carried out to absolute perfection . Had the letter been deposited within the range of their search , these fellows would , beyond a question , have found it . "" I merely laughed – but he seemed quite serious in all that he said . "" The measures , then , "" he continued , "" were good in their kind , and well executed ; their defect lay in their being inapplicable to the case , and to the man . A certain set of highly ingenious resources are , with the Prefect , a sort of Procrustean bed , to which he forcibly adapts his designs . But he perpetually errs by being too deep or too shallow , for the matter in hand ; and many a schoolboy is a better reasoner than he . I knew one about eight years of age , whose success at guessing in the game of ' even and odd ' attracted universal admiration . This game is simple , and is played with marbles . One player holds in his hand a number of these toys , and demands of another whether that number is even or odd . If the guess is right , the guesser wins one ; if wrong , he loses one . The boy to whom I allude won all the marbles of the school . Of course he had some principle of guessing ; and this lay in mere observation and admeasurement of the astuteness of his opponents . For example , an arrant simpleton is his opponent , and , holding up his closed hand , asks , ' are they even or odd ? ' Our schoolboy replies , ' odd , ' and loses ; but upon the second trial he wins , for he then says to himself , ' the simpleton had them even upon the first trial , and his amount of cunning is just sufficient to make him have them odd upon the second ; I will therefore guess odd ; ' – he guesses odd , and wins . Now , with a simpleton a degree above the first , he would have reasoned thus : ' This fellow finds that in the first instance I guessed odd , and , in the second , he will propose to himself , upon the first impulse , a simple variation from even to odd , as did the first simpleton ; but then a second thought will suggest that this is too simple a variation , and finally he will decide upon putting it even as before . I will therefore guess even ; ' – he guesses even , and wins . Now this mode of reasoning in the schoolboy , whom his fellows termed ' lucky , ' – what , in its last analysis , is it ? "" "" It is merely , "" I said , "" an identification of the reasoner's intellect with that of his opponent . "" "" It is , "" said Dupin ; "" and , upon inquiring , of the boy by what means he effected the thorough identification in which his success consisted , I received answer as follows : ' When I wish to find out how wise , or how stupid , or how good , or how wicked is any one , or what are his thoughts at the moment , I fashion the expression of my face , as accurately as possible , in accordance with the expression of his , and then wait to see what thoughts or sentiments arise in my mind or heart , as if to match or correspond with the expression . ' This response of the schoolboy lies at the bottom of all the spurious profundity which has been attributed to Rochefoucault , to La Bougive , to Machiavelli , and to Campanella . "" "" And the identification , "" I said , "" of the reasoner's intellect with that of his opponent , depends , if I understand you aright , upon the accuracy with which the opponent's intellect is admeasured . "" "" For its practical value it depends upon this , "" replied Dupin ; "" and the Prefect and his cohort fail so frequently , first , by default of this identification , and , secondly , by ill-admeasurement , or rather through non-admeasurement , of the intellect with which they are engaged . They consider only their own ideas of ingenuity ; and , in searching for anything hidden , advert only to the modes in which they would have hidden it . They are right in this much – that their own ingenuity is a faithful representative of that of the mass ; but when the cunning of the individual felon is diverse in character from their own , the felon foils them , of course . This always happens when it is above their own , and very usually when it is below . They have no variation of principle in their investigations ; at best , when urged by some unusual emergency – by some extraordinary reward – they extend or exaggerate their old modes of practice , without touching their principles . What , for example , in this case of D – , has been done to vary the principle of action ? What is all this boring , and probing , and sounding , and scrutinizing with the microscope and dividing the surface of the building into registered square inches – what is it all but an exaggeration of the application of the one principle or set of principles of search , which are based upon the one set of notions regarding human ingenuity , to which the Prefect , in the long routine of his duty , has been accustomed ? Do you not see he has taken it for granted that all men proceed to conceal a letter , – not exactly in a gimlet hole bored in a chair leg – but , at least , in some out-of-the-way hole or corner suggested by the same tenor of thought which would urge a man to secrete a letter in a gimlet hole bored in a chair leg ? And do you not see also , that such recherchés nooks for concealment are adapted only for ordinary occasions , and would be adopted only by ordinary intellects ; for , in all cases of concealment , a disposal of the article concealed – a disposal of it in this recherché manner , – is , in the very first instance , presumable and presumed ; and thus its discovery depends , not at all upon the acumen , but altogether upon the mere care , patience , and determination of the seekers ; and where the case is of importance – or , what amounts to the same thing in the policial eyes , when the reward is of magnitude , – the qualities in question have never been known to fail . You will now understand what I meant in suggesting that , had the purloined letter been hidden any where within the limits of the Prefect's examination – in other words , had the principle of its concealment been comprehended within the principles of the Prefect – its discovery would have been a matter altogether beyond question . This functionary , however , has been thoroughly mystified ; and the remote source of his defeat lies in the supposition that the Minister is a fool , because he has acquired renown as a poet . All fools are poets ; this the Prefect feels ; and he is merely guilty of a non distributio medii in thence inferring that all poets are fools . "" "" But is this really the poet ? "" I asked . "" There are two brothers , I know ; and both have attained reputation in letters . The Minister I believe has written learnedly on the Differential Calculus . He is a mathematician , and no poet . "" "" You are mistaken ; I know him well ; he is both . As poet and mathematician , he would reason well ; as mere mathematician , he could not have reasoned at all , and thus would have been at the mercy of the Prefect . "" "" You surprise me , "" I said , "" by these opinions , which have been contradicted by the voice of the world . You do not mean to set at naught the well-digested idea of centuries . The mathematical reason has long been regarded as the reason par excellence . "" "" ' Il y a à parièr , ' "" replied Dupin , quoting from Chamfort , "" ' que toute idée publique , toute convention reçue est une sottise , car elle a convenue au plus grand nombre . ' The mathematicians , I grant you , have done their best to promulgate the popular error to which you allude , and which is none the less an error for its promulgation as truth . With an art worthy a better cause , for example , they have insinuated the term ' analysis ' into application to algebra . The French are the originators of this particular deception ; but if a term is of any importance – if words derive any value from applicability – then ' analysis ' conveys ' algebra ' about as much as , in Latin , ' ambitus ' implies ' ambition , ' ' religio ' ' religion , ' or ' homines honesti , ' a set of honorable men . "" "" You have a quarrel on hand , I see , "" said I , "" with some of the algebraists of Paris ; but proceed . "" "" I dispute the availability , and thus the value , of that reason which is cultivated in any especial form other than the abstractly logical . I dispute , in particular , the reason educed by mathematical study . The mathematics are the science of form and quantity ; mathematical reasoning is merely logic applied to observation upon form and quantity . The great error lies in supposing that even the truths of what is called pure algebra , are abstract or general truths . And this error is so egregious that I am confounded at the universality with which it has been received . Mathematical axioms are not axioms of general truth . What is true of relation – of form and quantity – is often grossly false in regard to morals , for example . In this latter science it is very usually untrue that the aggregated parts are equal to the whole . In chemistry also the axiom fails . In the consideration of motive it fails ; for two motives , each of a given value , have not , necessarily , a value when united , equal to the sum of their values apart . There are numerous other mathematical truths which are only truths within the limits of relation . But the mathematician argues , from his finite truths , through habit , as if they were of an absolutely general applicability – as the world indeed imagines them to be . Bryant , in his very learned ' Mythology , ' mentions an analogous source of error , when he says that ' although the Pagan fables are not believed , yet we forget ourselves continually , and make inferences from them as existing realities . ' With the algebraists , however , who are Pagans themselves , the ' Pagan fables ' are believed , and the inferences are made , not so much through lapse of memory , as through an unaccountable addling of the brains . In short , I never yet encountered the mere mathematician who could be trusted out of equal roots , or one who did not clandestinely hold it as a point of his faith that x2 + px was absolutely and unconditionally equal to q . Say to one of these gentlemen , by way of experiment , if you please , that you believe occasions may occur where x2 + px is not altogether equal to q , and , having made him understand what you mean , get out of his reach as speedily as convenient , for , beyond doubt , he will endeavor to knock you down . "" I mean to say , "" continued Dupin , while I merely laughed at his last observations , "" that if the Minister had been no more than a mathematician , the Prefect would have been under no necessity of giving me this check . I know him , however , as both mathematician and poet , and my measures were adapted to his capacity , with reference to the circumstances by which he was surrounded . I knew him as a courtier , too , and as a bold intriguant . Such a man , I considered , could not fail to be aware of the ordinary policial modes of action . He could not have failed to anticipate – and events have proved that he did not fail to anticipate – the waylayings to which he was subjected . He must have foreseen , I reflected , the secret investigations of his premises . His frequent absences from home at night , which were hailed by the Prefect as certain aids to his success , I regarded only as ruses , to afford opportunity for thorough search to the police , and thus the sooner to impress them with the conviction to which G – – , in fact , did finally arrive – the conviction that the letter was not upon the premises . I felt , also , that the whole train of thought , which I was at some pains in detailing to you just now , concerning the invariable principle of policial action in searches for articles concealed – I felt that this whole train of thought would necessarily pass through the mind of the Minister . It would imperatively lead him to despise all the ordinary nooks of concealment . He could not , I reflected , be so weak as not to see that the most intricate and remote recess of his hotel would be as open as his commonest closets to the eyes , to the probes , to the gimlets , and to the microscopes of the Prefect . I saw , in fine , that he would be driven , as a matter of course , to simplicity , if not deliberately induced to it as a matter of choice . You will remember , perhaps , how desperately the Prefect laughed when I suggested , upon our first interview , that it was just possible this mystery troubled him so much on account of its being so very self-evident . "" "" Yes , "" said I , "" I remember his merriment well . I really thought he would have fallen into convulsions . "" "" The material world , "" continued Dupin , "" abounds with very strict analogies to the immaterial ; and thus some color of truth has been given to the rhetorical dogma , that metaphor , or simile , may be made to strengthen an argument , as well as to embellish a description . The principle of the vis inertiæ , for example , seems to be identical in physics and metaphysics . It is not more true in the former , that a large body is with more difficulty set in motion than a smaller one , and that its subsequent momentum is commensurate with this difficulty , than it is , in the latter , that intellects of the vaster capacity , while more forcible , more constant , and more eventful in their movements than those of inferior grade , are yet the less readily moved , and more embarrassed and full of hesitation in the first few steps of their progress . Again : have you ever noticed which of the street signs , over the shop-doors , are the most attractive of attention ? "" "" I have never given the matter a thought , "" I said . "" There is a game of puzzles , "" he resumed , "" which is played upon a map . One party playing requires another to find a given word – the name of town , river , state or empire – any word , in short , upon the motley and perplexed surface of the chart . A novice in the game generally seeks to embarrass his opponents by giving them the most minutely lettered names ; but the adept selects such words as stretch , in large characters , from one end of the chart to the other . These , like the over largely lettered signs and placards of the street , escape observation by dint of being excessively obvious ; and here the physical oversight is precisely analogous with the moral inapprehension by which the intellect suffers to pass unnoticed those considerations which are too obtrusively and too palpably self evident . But this is a point , it appears , somewhat above or beneath the understanding of the Prefect . He never once thought it probable , or possible , that the Minister had deposited the letter immediately beneath the nose of the whole world , by way of best preventing any portion of that world from perceiving it . "" But the more I reflected upon the daring , dashing , and discriminating ingenuity of D – – ; upon the fact that the document must always have been at hand , if he intended to use it to good purpose ; and upon the decisive evidence , obtained by the Prefect , that it was not hidden within the limits of that dignitary's ordinary search – the more satisfied I became that , to conceal this letter , the Minister had resorted to the comprehensive and sagacious expedient of not attempting to conceal it at all . "" Full of these ideas , I prepared myself with a pair of green spectacles , and called one fine morning , quite by accident , at the Ministerial hotel . I found D – – at home , yawning , lounging , and dawdling , as usual , and pretending to be in the last extremity of ennui . He is , perhaps , the most really energetic human being now alive – but that is only when nobody sees him . "" To be even with him , I complained of my weak eyes , and lamented the necessity of the spectacles , under cover of which I cautiously and thoroughly surveyed the whole apartment , while seemingly intent only upon the conversation of my host . "" I paid especial attention to a large writing-table near which he sat , and upon which lay confusedly , some miscellaneous letters and other papers , with one or two musical instruments and a few books . Here , however , after a long and very deliberate scrutiny , I saw nothing to excite particular suspicion . "" At length my eyes , in going the circuit of the room , fell upon a trumpery fillagree card-rack of pasteboard , that hung dangling by a dirty blue ribbon , from a little brass knob just beneath the middle of the mantel-piece . In this rack , which had three or four compartments , were five or six visiting cards and a solitary letter . This last was much soiled and crumpled . It was torn nearly in two , across the middle – as if a design , in the first instance , to tear it entirely up as worthless , had been altered , or stayed , in the second . It had a large black seal , bearing the D – – cipher very conspicuously , and was addressed , in a diminutive female hand , to D – – , the minister , himself . It was thrust carelessly , and even , as it seemed , contemptuously , into one of the uppermost divisions of the rack . "" No sooner had I glanced at this letter , than I concluded it to be that of which I was in search . To be sure , it was , to all appearance , radically different from the one of which the Prefect had read us so minute a description . Here the seal was large and black , with the D – – cipher ; there it was small and red , with the ducal arms of the S – – family . Here , the address , to the Minister , diminutive and feminine ; there the superscription , to a certain royal personage , was markedly bold and decided ; the size alone formed a point of correspondence . But , then , the radicalness of these differences , which was excessive ; the dirt ; the soiled and torn condition of the paper , so inconsistent with the true methodical habits of D – – , and so suggestive of a design to delude the beholder into an idea of the worthlessness of the document ; these things , together with the hyper-obtrusive situation of this document , full in the view of every visiter , and thus exactly in accordance with the conclusions to which I had previously arrived ; these things , I say , were strongly corroborative of suspicion , in one who came with the intention to suspect . "" I protracted my visit as long as possible , and , while I maintained a most animated discussion with the Minister upon a topic which I knew well had never failed to interest and excite him , I kept my attention really riveted upon the letter . In this examination , I committed to memory its external appearance and arrangement in the rack ; and also fell , at length , upon a discovery which set at rest whatever trivial doubt I might have entertained . In scrutinizing the edges of the paper , I observed them to be more chafed than seemed necessary . They presented the broken appearance which is manifested when a stiff paper , having been once folded and pressed with a folder , is refolded in a reversed direction , in the same creases or edges which had formed the original fold . This discovery was sufficient . It was clear to me that the letter had been turned , as a glove , inside out , re-directed , and re-sealed . I bade the Minister good morning , and took my departure at once , leaving a gold snuff box upon the table . "" The next morning I called for the snuff-box , when we resumed , quite eagerly , the conversation of the preceding day . While thus engaged , however , a loud report , as if of a pistol , was heard immediately beneath the windows of the hotel , and was succeeded by a series of fearful screams , and the shoutings of a terrified mob . D – – rushed to a casement , threw it open , and looked out . In the meantime , I stepped to the card-rack took the letter , put it in my pocket , and replaced it by a fac-simile , ( so far as regards externals , ) which I had carefully prepared at my lodgings – imitating the D – – cipher , very readily , by means of a seal formed of bread . "" The disturbance in the street had been occasioned by the frantic behavior of a man with a musket . He had fired it among a crowd of women and children . It proved , however , to have been without ball , and the fellow was suffered to go his way as a lunatic or a drunkard . When he had gone , D – – came from the window , whither I had followed him immediately upon securing the object in view . Soon afterwards I bade him farewell . The pretended lunatic was a man in my own pay . "" "" But what purpose had you , "" I asked , "" in replacing the letter by a fac-simile ? Would it not have been better , at the first visit , to have seized it openly , and departed ? "" "" D – – , "" replied Dupin , "" is a desperate man , and a man of nerve . His hotel , too , is not without attendants devoted to his interests . Had I made the wild attempt you suggest , I might never have left the Ministerial presence alive . The good people of Paris might have heard of me no more . But I had an object apart from these considerations . You know my political prepossessions . In this matter , I act as a partisan of the lady concerned . For eighteen months the Minister has had her in his power . She has now him in hers – since , being unaware that the letter is not in his possession , he will proceed with his exactions as if it was . Thus will he inevitably commit himself , at once , to his political destruction . His downfall , too , will not be more precipitate than awkward . It is all very well to talk about the facilis descensus Averni ; but in all kinds of climbing , as Catalani said of singing , it is far more easy to get up than to come down . In the present instance I have no sympathy – at least no pity – for him who descends . He is that monstrum horrendum , an unprincipled man of genius . I confess , however , that I should like very well to know the precise character of his thoughts , when , being defied by her whom the Prefect terms ' a certain personage ' he is reduced to opening the letter which I left for him in the card-rack . "" "" How ? did you put any thing particular in it ? "" "" Why – it did not seem altogether right to leave the interior blank – that would have been insulting . D – – , at Vienna once , did me an evil turn , which I told him , quite good humoredly , that I should remember . So , as I knew he would feel some curiosity in regard to the identity of the person who had outwitted him , I thought it a pity not to give him a clue . He is well acquainted with my MS . , and I just copied into the middle of the blank sheet the words – "" ' – – – – Un dessein si funeste , S ' il n ' est digne d ' Atrée , est digne de Thyeste . They are to be found in Crébillon's ' Atrée . ' "" </doc>

The mammoth efforts of law enforcement officials have helped to reduce the number of arrested for suspicion of DUI by nearly twenty five percent in 2010 compared to 2008 but nearly thirty percent of those arrested for DUI in Colorado have involved repeat offenders . The new court will implement a combination of current punishments and an intensive treatment program that could help to rehabilitate drivers who could have been likely to have gotten behind the wheel while impaired again . The program will be funded by nearly six hundred thousand dollars in grant money and will focus on lengthy bouts of treatment and frequent blood alcohol monitoring and regular interactions with judges to monitor progress . While this program may not be right for everyone who has made the decision to get behind the wheel while impaired more than once it could make a big difference in making the streets safer . Unfortunately , the program wo n't be large enough to accommodate all repeat offenders and many will still face the possibility of very severe punishments of prison , fines and license suspensions .

Hiring a Colorado criminal defense attorney gives you the best opportunity of having your DUI charges reduced or dismissed so that you face a series of much more tolerable punishments following your trial . Holiday Efforts Result in DUI Arrests Law enforcement officials in Colorado seem even more serious about removing impaired drivers from the streets this summer and keeping Colorado streets safe . In a one night DUI checkpoint on Fort Collins on Memorial Day Weekend police made contact with over 1000 drivers and ultimately arrested more than twenty for driving under the influence or driving while ability impaired . This monumental effort was just the beginning of the 100 Day of Heat program in Colorado that will increase officer presence and efforts on the streets and help to minimize the number of DUI related accidents and fatalities that plague the state of Colorado this summer .

Impaired driving can easily result in serious accidents that cause injuries or deaths and the charges associated with a DUI conviction are something that no one wants to experience . Unfortunately many drivers still decide to get behind the wheel while intoxicated and that initial poor decision can often lead to subsequent poor decisions that ultimately cause more damage and increase the consequences that will be faced following the incident . Some drivers who operate their vehicles while impaired and get stopped by police are frightened by the potential consequences that they could face and wind up attempting to evade police .

1389,A12,"What kind of professional business people can benefit from using a 24-hour message service ? Is it only for Doctor's and Dentist's Offices ? Would other professions benefit from having a live receptionist answer their phone 24 hours a day , 7 days a week ? Let 's take a look at that . The Office is a different place , these days . It 's no longer a big building , with cubby holes , and small partitions . An office nowadays is anywhere you set up your computer , or hold your cell phone . A lot of business people have now moved their offices into their own homes . Most people do n't have room for a receptionist in their bedroom , or kitchen , and would n't be able to afford the full-time salary anyway . But , there are a lot of reasons an answering service would be a workable solution for fields other than medical and dental . Attorneys have streamlined their operations . Many independent lawyers work from their homes . They would benefit by having an off-site receptionist answer their business telephone while they 're in court . The answering service can then text messages to them , and the attorney can respond at a court recess . People in the Real Estate business are also tending to work from their homes . They have to leave their home offices many times a day . They have to show houses to clients , and it would n't be very feasible for them to field calls . Entrepreneurs engage in starting up and running new businesses . Answering services make sense for them because they do n't have to incur the huge expense of another person on their payroll . They can also give the appearance of having an established company , with the off-site , professional receptionist . Entertainment Industry Companies are involved with different projects for limited amounts of time . There is a transitory nature to the business . Having a centralized , inexpensive answering service as their base of communications is a good idea . You never have to pay to move a virtual office . Anyone in the Construction and Landscaping business could cut out the expense of having an office , altogether . They perform their services at different outdoor places , all the time . This would also include Plumbers , Board-up and Glass Companies , and Roofers , etc. Restoration Companies are in a different category all together . They are involved in emergencies . The people who call them are in trouble , and never on a nine-to-five schedule . They need a communication base that is alert 24 hours a day . Security Guard Services is another field where they are never performing their duties at the same place . Therefore , a "" virtual office "" with 24 hour answering services is ideal . Many companies , today , are in the same situation . They do n't need the big offices , anymore . Technology has become advanced enough to allow them freedom . They can cut down on physical space , and the cost thereof . If you want to talk to a 24-hour Live Receptionist and Answering Service , there is one that is based in Los Angeles , called Global Messaging Network . They can answer any question you have , and give you exact prices on services that fit your needs . 800-244-4334 , info@globalmessaging.net , www.globalmessaging.net . </doc>

26,A1,"Will Russia Save the West ? MOSCOW – Rapid changes in the global economy and international politics are raising , once more , an eternal issue in Russia : the country's relations with Europe , and with the Euro-Atlantic region as a whole . Of course , Russia partly belongs to this region . Yet it can not and does not want to join the West wholeheartedly – at least not yet . Meanwhile , this choice looks very different now compared to just a few years ago . It is becoming obvious that the Euro-Atlantic world , whose economic and political model seemed so triumphant 20 years ago , is now lagging somewhat behind China and other Asian countries . So is Russia , where , despite encouraging talk about innovation-based development , the economy continues to de-modernize as corruption has been allowed to metastasize , and as the country relies increasingly on its natural-resource wealth . Indeed , it is Asia that has turned out to be the true winner of the Cold War . These rising powers raise problems regarding Russia's geo-strategic choices . For the first time in decades , the values gap between Russia and the EU appears to be increasing . Europe is overcoming state nationalism , while Russia is building a nation state . Broken by history and not wishing to be ravaged by war again , Europeans have embraced compromise and renounced the direct use of force in international relations . Russians , on the other hand , emphasize their "" hard power , "" including military force , because they know that they live in a dangerous world and have no one to hide behind . And , because of the country's comparative lack of "" soft power "" – social , cultural , and economic attractiveness – it stands ready to use the competitive advantages ( i . e . , its resource wealth ) available to it . Internal political developments in Russia are also pushing the country in a different direction from the West . Quite simply , Russia is moving away from democracy . This emerging values gap is not an insurmountable obstacle to geostrategic rapprochement . But , coupled with mutual irritation , which is particularly strong in Russia , closing the gap is becoming much harder . For , while Russia ' s elite never considered itself defeated in the Cold War , the West essentially treated Russia as a defeated country – an attitude symbolized by NATO's eastward expansion , which laid a deep foundation for ongoing tension . It was only after the West encountered an armed rebuff in South Ossetia that NATO expansion was stopped in its tracks . Yet NATO has not given up on further enlargement . NATO expansion is nothing more than the extension of its zone of influence – and in the most sensitive , military-political sphere . And yet the West's unwillingness to abandon that effort is coupled with a repeated refusal to recognize Russia's right to have its own zone of interest . So NATO expansion has left the Cold War unfinished . The ideological and military confrontation that underlay it is gone , but the geopolitical rivalry that it entailed has returned to the fore . Thus , the old mentality survived on both sides . Energy debates are another example of this . Non-Russian Europe should thank the Almighty for the presence of energy-rich Russia at its borders , while Russia should be thankful for having such wealthy customers . But the natural differences in the interests of energy consumers and producers have been given a political / security twist – witness the discussions about an "" Energy NATO . "" F aced with the impossibility of advantageous accession to Euro-Atlantic institutions , Russia is drifting fast towards alignment with China – a "" younger brother , "" though a respected one . Russia's "" Asian choice "" of today is not the same as the Slavophile / Eurasian choice of the past . On the surface , it looks like a choice in favor of a rapidly rising civilization . But the current estrangement from Europe – the cradle of Russian civilization and modernization – threatens Russia's identity and will increase its geostrategic risks in the future . Europe does not benefit from this estrangement either . It will continue to move towards beautiful decay – Venice writ large . The United States also loses . Without Russia , which will remain the world's third strongest power for the foreseeable future , it is impossible to solve the key problems of international security . The current Euro-Atlantic security architecture seems to suit the majority of Americans and Europeans , though it is becoming increasingly fragile and counterproductive . So Russia will struggle to create a new architecture largely on its own – whether through a new treaty on collective European security , or even through its accession to NATO . This is not only in Russian political and civilizational interest , but it also reflects our duty to the entire community of Euro-Atlantic nations , which is being weakened by the "" unfinished Cold War . "" The idea of a "" Union of Europe "" between Russia and the EU should be put on the long-term agenda . That Union should be based on a common human , economic , and energy space . The combination of a new security arrangement for the Euro-Atlantic community and the establishment of the Union of Europe could arrest the decline in the international weight of the West . </doc>

1423,A1,"Posts Tagged ' freedom to fail ' Pete Dawkins ( West Point class of 1959 , Heisman Trophy winner , First Captain of the Corps of Cadets , in the top of his class in academics , with a distinguished military career ) as a Captain wrote a seminal article entitled "" Freedom to Fail "" which was published in Infantry Magazine . In this article Dawkins said that the Army's Officer Efficiency Report ( OER ) system that demanded perfection of officers who wished to advance their careers , was actually damaging the effectiveness of the officer corps . Â Any officer who did not repeatedly score either 98 or 99 out of 100 on his OER could not expect choice assignments or rapid promotion . Â This commonly known fact , he argued , ran the danger of creating a system that favored the advancement of timid officers whose fear of failure kept them from bold , innovative actions and decisions â € "" just the opposite of what the Army would want in combat leaders . As Dawkins aptly pointed out , failure can be the greatest teacher we have . Â It fosters critical review of the actions leading to the failure , while success breeds complacency and acceptance of the status quo . Another military example : Â in July 1863 , Confederate General James Longstreet watched two of his divisions severely repulsed in the disastrous Pickett's Charge at Gettysburg . Â Longstreet had opposed Lee's plan for a multi-division assault on a broad front , but was overruled by his superior . Several months later , Longstreet used the lesson learned from that defeat to launch a successful attack against Union lines at Chickamauga . Â This time he formed his attacking force into columns of divisions to deal a sharp and irresistible blow that shattered the Union line and routed nearly a third of Rosecran's Army of the Cumberland . So what does this lesson from military history have to do with hospitality management ? Â Plenty ! Â Leadership is leadership no matter what the enterprise or situation . Â Any leader who creates an organization where leaders are not given the freedom to fail , risks the larger failure of mediocrity . Leaders should give their subordinates plenty of latitude to figure out how to solve problems or plan projects without being micro-managed by their bosses . Â Subordinates should be encouraged to formulate and execute bold and innovative ideas . Â Certainly failure will occur , but rather than blaming those responsible , encourage subordinates to conduct rigorous in-depth reviews of what went wrong and how things might have been done differently . Â The critical review process is the opportunity to learn and grow . Â Serious and sincere soul-searching for answers will inevitably lead to understandings that will improve future performance . Having extolled the upside of mistakes let me also add that some errors are so egregious and obviously foolish that they call into question the subordinate's judgment . Â While no leader can ensure that all his subordinates have basic common sense and good judgment , he can monitor their work to avoid the worst mistakes . Such monitoring is made much easier when there is good , open communication between the leader and subordinates . Â Conversely , an uncommunicative leader helps create the environment where subordinates acting on their own are afraid to approach the leader to seek advice and guidance . Â In this situation the failure is the leader's . Things every leader / manager should do : Do not micro-manage . Give subordinates broad directions and desired outcomes , but allow them to formulate and execute the details . Foster good two-way communications so that subordinates keep you informed of progress and are unafraid to seek advice . When giving guidance , explain the why 's as well as the how 's so that subordinates gain a broader understanding of your thought processes . When mistakes are inevitably made , do not get angry . Instead , be supportive and require subordinates to conduct a rigorous post mortem to determine what went wrong and what might have been done differently . Do n't be afraid to give the failing subordinate new opportunities to prove his or her abilities . In other words , when he gets thrown from his horse , make sure he gets back up on it again . Failing is an inherent and useful part of human growth . Â Make sure your subordinates have the "" freedom to fail . "" </doc>

464,A8,"9-11 July 2004 The hopes of a nation's Formula One fans rest largely on Lucky Strike B. A. R Honda's shoulders this weekend as the team prepares to do battle in its home race at Silverstone . The race team hot-footed its way back from Magny-Cours to B. A. R's Northamptonshire base on Sunday night , ready to put all their efforts into the British Grand Prix , which takes place quite literally on the team's own doorstep . Every team and driver wants to win their home event and B. A. R Honda and lead driver Jenson Button are no exception . After an excellent first half of the season , in which he has brought home six trophies in ten races , Jenson's sights are firmly set on that elusive maiden win for himself and the team . There could be no better venue than Silverstone to take the victory spoils , where his legions of British fans will be out in force and practically the entire B. A. R workforce will take over a grandstand for the weekend to will both drivers to glory on home asphalt . Round 11 of the Formula One World Championship is the last of three gruelling back-to-back races in the 2004 calendar , falling just one week after a disappointing French Grand Prix for the team . The problems , which afflicted both Jenson and Takuma last weekend , are the subject of the most rigorous investigations and the team will leave no stone unturned to ensure reliability is not an issue this Sunday . The team consolidated its third place position in the Constructors' standings last weekend but lost all of the ground it had gained on Renault as a result of Takuma's retirement and the anti-stall trigger , which cost Jenson precious time and a potential podium in his final pitstop . Jenson geared up for his Silverstone challenge when he raced into London's Regent Street on Tuesday 6 July . Over 100,000 spectators got a rare opportunity to see Jenson and his B. A. R Honda race car at close quarters , albeit at a rather more sedate pace than the 300km / h plus speeds he will be unleashing next Sunday . Jenson Button on the British Grand Prix "" After the disappointment of Magny-Cours , where we had a good chance of a podium , it feels great to be back in Britain to prepare for our home race . We targeted our first win for around this point in the season and it goes without saying that it would be fantastic to achieve that this weekend . This race is special for so many reasons . I love racing here and will never forget my debut F1 race here four years ago when I passed Michael Schumacher on the first lap . He might have been on a different fuel load but that was a fantastic moment nonetheless . It 's incredibly moving to race in front of my home crowd , especially with the sea of Union Jacks down the start-finish straight ! Most importantly , this is a weekend when the whole team get to share in our achievements and I just hope that we have something special to celebrate with them on Sunday night . "" Takuma Sato on the British Grand Prix "" Obviously Suzuka is my own home race , but I now live in England and this is my second home . I want to do well in front of the team and its many British fans and I hope I have the car to deliver a good result next Sunday . The British Grand Prix is one of the most exciting in my opinion . I also have very fond memories of the circuit from my Junior and Formula 3 days , so I am always very excited to head back there . It 's a shame that we had a slightly disappointing result at the French Grand Prix , however I am still confident from our performance in Indy . Historically , Silverstone is always an exciting race , especially with the unpredictable weather , so it could be very exciting . "" Anthony Davidson , B. A. R Honda's British Third Driver "" We have been very quick at Silverstone in general testing this year and both Jenson and Taku topped the timesheets on the days when they ran here . From a personal perspective , this will be the best Friday I 've ever had in terms of recognition and it will be great to get a share of the limelight with the British fans . I live just a few miles from Silverstone so I am very well acquainted with the changeable weather conditions we get here and which always make the British Grand Prix even more exciting ! As always , I 'll be doing my bit to get the team off to a good start on Friday . "" David Richards , Team Principal "" There is a great deal of expectation on our shoulders as we head into our home race this weekend . Silverstone is in our own backyard with Jenson currently the top British driver , I would anticipate that a large proportion of British F1 fans will be pinning their hopes on us this Sunday . Obviously it would be wonderful to achieve our maiden victory at our home track , but whatever the outcome , it will be a very special weekend . Very few of our staff ever get to go to a race and yet each and every one of them has been integral to the transformation in our performance this season . We have created plenty of opportunities for them to be part of the action this weekend and to see the benefits of their hard work at close quarters . The Regent Street event is a fantastic curtain-raiser for the Grand Prix and the opportunity to bring the fans even closer to the sport and their heroes . However , in the heat of the preparations , we can not overlook the fact that the French Grand Prix was a disappointment for us and we will be doing everything possible in the days ahead to ensure we are fully on top of any factors which have compromised us . All in all , it will be a very exciting weekend ahead ! "" Geoffrey Willis , Technical Director "" In Magny-Cours we did not achieve either our full performance potential or reliability and both areas need addressing in the short run up to the British Grand Prix and beyond . The Silverstone circuit requires a harder tyre solution than normal to cope with the very high speed corners and loadings they induce . The harder compounds reduce degradation but this has to be balanced against losing too much grip for the slower speed areas at Club and in the complex . The nature of the corners also requires a car that can be stable under high speed changes of direction without generating lower speed understeer or poor traction . We were able to use the Silverstone test in early June to work on the tyre choices with Michelin and investigate set-up solutions suited to the track . So going into our home race we are confident of fighting for a good result . "" Shuhei Nakamoto , Engineering Director , Honda Racing Development "" We had a tough weekend in France and we will of course be working very hard to get back into our podium scoring form . The British Grand Prix is a very important race for us - we always enjoy competing on home ground and it 'll be great to race in front of the local fans and many of our staff . "" The Circuit Race distance - 60 laps . 191.644 miles ( 308 . 355km ) Circuit length - 3.195 miles ( 5 . 141 km ) Race Start - 13.00 GMT This historic circuit , a former airfield , is one of the few remaining venues where Formula One cars can really be unleashed and as a result it is still one of the highlights of the calendar - amply demonstrated by last year's incredible race . The circuit itself is a thrilling drive , although there is some criticism over a lack of passing places . However , overtaking moves are possible into Vale and Abbey , although cars tend to lose downforce following each other closely through the preceding fast corners . The entry to Becketts is now the quickest corner on the track , a 290 km / h bend , while the slowest section is the 80 km / h , Vale left-hander that leads directly into Club corner . Silverstone has been heavily censured in the past because of the traffic problems that have arisen on the small access roads around the circuit . However , the new road system introduced just in time for the 2002 race seems to have rectified most of these issues once and for all . Honda F1 Highlights - Honda-powered drivers enjoyed four consecutive triumphs at the British Grand Prix in the late 1980s - Nigel Mansell taking victory in 1986 and 1987 , Ayrton Senna in 1988 and Alain Prost in 1989 . - In 1987 Honda savoured its most successful ever Grand Prix at Silverstone when cars powered by its engines came home in first , second , third and fourth positions - Nigel Mansell and Nelson Piquet in Williams Hondas followed by Ayrton Senna and Satoru Nakajima in Lotus Hondas . </doc>

97,A1,"Now , have any of y ' all ever looked up this word ? You know , in a dictionary ? ( Laughter ) Yeah , that 's what I thought . How about this word ? Here , I 'll show it to you : Lexicography : the practice of compiling dictionaries . Notice -- we 're very specific . That word "" compile . "" The dictionary is not carved out of a piece of granite , out of a lump of rock . It 's made up of lots of little bits . It 's little discrete -- that 's spelled D-I-S-C-R-E-T-E -- bits . And those bits are words . Now one of the perks of being a lexicographer -- besides getting to come to TED -- is that you get to say really fun words , like lexicographical . Lexicographical has this great pattern -- it 's called a double dactyl . And just by saying double dactyl , I 've sent the geek needle all the way into the red . But "" lexicographical "" is the same pattern as "" higgledy-piggledy . "" Right ? It 's a fun word to say , and I get to say it a lot . Now , one of the non-perks of being a lexicographer is that people do n't usually have a kind of warm , fuzzy , snuggly image of the dictionary . Right ? Nobody hugs their dictionaries . But what people really often think about the dictionary is , they think more like this . Just to let you know , I do not have a lexicographical whistle . But people think that my job is to let the good words make that difficult left hand turn into the dictionary , and keep the bad words out . But the thing is , I do n't want to be a traffic cop . For one thing , I just do not do uniforms . And for another -- deciding what words are good and what words are bad is actually not very easy . And it 's not very fun . And when parts of your job are not easy or fun , you kind of look for an excuse not to do them . So if I had to think of some kind of occupation as a metaphor for my work , I would much rather be a fisherman . I wanna throw my big net into the deep blue ocean of English and see what marvelous creatures I can drag up from the bottom . But why do people want me to direct traffic , when I would much rather go fishing ? Well , I blame the Queen . Why do I blame the Queen ? Well , first of all , I blame the Queen because it 's funny . But secondly , I blame the Queen because dictionaries have really not changed . Our idea of what a dictionary is has not changed since her reign . The only thing Queen Victoria would not be amused by in modern dictionaries is our inclusion of the F-word , which has happened in American dictionaries since 1965 . So , there 's this guy , right ? Victorian era . James Murray , first editor of the Oxford English Dictionary . I do not have that hat . I wish I had that hat . So he 's really responsible for a lot of what we consider modern in dictionaries today . When a guy who looks like that -- in that hat -- is the face of modernity , you have a problem . And so , James Murray could get a job on any dictionary today . There 'd be virtually no learning curve . And of course , a few of us are saying : Computers ! Computers ! What about computers ? The thing about computers is -- I love computers . I mean , I 'm a huge geek , I love computers . I would go on a hunger strike before I let them take away Google Book Search from me . But computers do n't do much else other than speed up the process of compiling dictionaries . They do n't change the end result . Because what a dictionary is , is it 's Victorian design merged with a little bit of modern propulsion . It 's steampunk . What we have is an electric velocipede . You know , we have Victorian design with an engine on it . That 's all ! The design has not changed . And OK , what about online dictionaries , right ? Online dictionaries must be different . This is the Oxford English Dictionary Online , one of the best online dictionaries . This is my favorite word , by the way : Erinaceous : Pertaining to the hedgehog family ; of the nature of a hedgehog . Very useful word . So look at that . Online dictionaries right now are paper thrown up on a screen . This is flat . Look how many links there are in the actual entry : two ! Right ? Those little buttons -- I had them all expanded except for the date chart . So there 's not very much going on here . There 's not a lot of clickiness . And in fact , online dictionaries replicate almost all the problems of print , except for searchability . And when you improve searchability , you actually take away the one advantage of print , which is serendipity . Serendipity is when you find things you were n ' t looking for because finding what you are looking for is so damned difficult . So -- ( Laughter ) -- now , when you think about this , what we have here is a ham butt problem . Does everyone know the ham butt problem ? Woman 's making a ham for a big family dinner . She goes to cut the butt off the ham and throw it away , and she looks at this piece of ham and she 's like , "" This is a perfectly good piece of ham . Why am I throwing this away ? "" She thought , "" Well my mom always did this . "" So she calls up Mom , and she says , "" Mom , why 'd you cut the butt off the ham when you 're making a ham ? "" She says , "" I do n't know , my mom always did it ! "" So they call Grandma , and Grandma says , "" My pan was too small ! "" ( Laughter ) So it 's not that we have good words and bad words -- we have a pan that 's too small ! You know , that ham butt is delicious ! There 's no reason to throw it away . The bad words -- see , when people think about a place and they do n't find a place on the map , they think , "" This map sucks ! "" When they find a nightspot or a bar and it 's not in the guidebook , they 're like , "" Ooh , this place must be cool ! It 's not in the guidebook . "" When they find a word that 's not in the dictionary , they think , "" This must be a bad word . "" Why ? It 's more likely to be a bad dictionary . Why are you blaming the ham for being too big for the pan ? So you ca n ' t get a smaller ham . The English language is as big as it is . So if you have a ham butt problem , and you 're thinking about the ham butt problem , the conclusion it leads you to is inexorable and counter-intuitive : paper is the enemy of words . How can this be ? I mean , I love books . I really love books . Some of my best friends are books . But the book is not the best shape for the dictionary . Now they 're gonna think "" Oh , boy . People are gonna take away my beautiful , paper dictionaries ? "" No. There will still be paper dictionaries . When we had cars -- when cars became the dominant mode of transportation , we did n't round up all the horses and shoot them . You know , there 're still gonna be paper dictionaries , but it 's not going to be the dominant dictionary . The book-shaped dictionary is not going to be the only shape dictionaries come in . And it 's not going to be the prototype for the shapes dictionaries come in . So think about it this way : if you 've got an artificial constraint , artificial constraints lead to arbitrary distinctions and a skewed worldview . What if biologists could only study animals that made people go , "" Aww . "" Right ? What if we made aesthetic judgments about animals , and only the ones we thought were cute were the ones that we could study ? We 'd know a whole lot about charismatic megafauna , and not very much about much else . And I think this is a problem . I think we should study all the words , because when you think about words , you can make beautiful expressions from very humble parts . Lexicography is really more about material science . We are studying the tolerances of the materials that you use to build the structure of your expression : your speeches and your writing . And then often people say to me , "" Well , OK -- how do I know that this word is real ? "" They think , "" OK , if we think words are the tools that we use to build the expressions of our thoughts , how can you say that screwdrivers are better than hammers ? How can you say that a sledgehammer is better than a ball-peen hammer ? They 're just the right tool for the job . "" And so people say to me , "" How do I know if a word is real ? "" You know , anyone that 's read a children's book knows that love makes things real . If you love a word , use it . That makes it real . Being in the dictionary is an artificial distinction . It does n ' t make a word any more real than any other way . If you love a word , it becomes real . So if we 're not worrying about directing traffic , if we 've transcended paper , if we are worrying less about control and more about description , then we can think of the English language as being this beautiful mobile . And any time one of those little parts of the mobile changes , is touched -- any time you touch a word , you use it in a new context , you give it a new connotation , you verb it -- you make the mobile move . You did n't break it ; it 's just in a new position , and that new position can be just as beautiful . Now , if you 're no longer a traffic cop -- the problem with being a traffic cop is there can only be so many traffic cops in any one intersection , or the cars get confused . Right ? But if your goal is no longer to direct the traffic , but maybe to count the cars that go by , then more eyeballs are better . You can ask for help ! If you ask for help , you get more done . And we really need help . Library of Congress : 17 million books . Of which half are in English . If only one out of every 10 of those books had a word that 's not in the dictionary in it , that would be equivalent to more than two unabridged dictionaries . And I find an un-dictionaried word -- a word like "" un-dictionaried , "" for example -- in almost every book I read . What about newspapers ? Newspaper archive goes back to 1759 . 58.1 million newspaper pages . If only one in 100 of those pages had an un-dictionaried word on it , it would be an entire other OED . That 's 500,000 more words . So that 's -- that 's a lot . And I 'm not even talking about magazines , I 'm not talking about blogs -- and I find more new words on BoingBoing in a given week than I do Newsweek or Time . There 's a lot going on there . And I 'm not even talking about polysemy , which is the greedy habit some words have of taking more than one meaning for themselves . So if you think of the word "" set "" -- a set can be a badger's burrow , a set can be one of the pleats in an Elizabethan ruff -- and there 's one numbered definition in the OED . The OED has 33 different numbered definitions for set . Tiny little word , 33 numbered definitions . One of them is just labeled "" miscellaneous technical senses . "" Do you know what that says to me ? That says to me it was Friday afternoon and somebody wanted to go down the pub . That 's a lexicographical cop out , to say , "" miscellaneous technical senses . "" So we have all these words , and we really need help ! And the thing is , we could ask for help -- asking for help 's not that hard . I mean , lexicography is not rocket science . See , I just gave you a lot of words and a lot of numbers , and this is more of a visual explanation . If we think of the dictionary as being the map of the English language , these bright spots are what we know about and the dark spots are where we are in the dark . If that was the map of all the words in American English , we do n't know very much . And we do n't even know the shape of the language . If this was the dictionary -- if this was the map of American English -- look , we have a kind of lumpy idea of Florida , but there 's no California ! We 're missing California from American English . We just do n't know enough , and we do n't even know we 're missing California . We do n't even see that there 's a gap on the map . So again , lexicography is not rocket science . But even if it were , rocket science is being done by dedicated amateurs these days . You know ? It ca n ' t be that hard to find some words ! So , enough scientists in other disciplines are really asking people to help , and they 're doing a good job of it . For instance : there 's eBird , where amateur birdwatchers can upload information about their bird sightings . And then ornithologists can go and help track populations , migrations , et cetera . And there 's this guy Mike Oates . Mike Oates lives in the U. K. He 's a director of an electroplating company . He 's found more than 140 comets . He 's found so many comets , they named a comet after him . It 's kind of out past Mars -- it 's a hike . I do n't think he 's getting his picture taken there anytime soon . But he found 140 comets without a telescope . He downloaded data from the NASA SOHO satellite , and that 's how he found them . If we can find comets without a telescope , should n ' t we be able to find words ? Now , y ' all know where I 'm going with this . Because I 'm going to the Internet , which is where everybody goes . And the Internet is great for collecting words , because the Internet 's full of collectors . And this is a little-known technological fact about the Internet , but the Internet is actually made up of words and enthusiasm . And words and enthusiasm actually happen to be the recipe for lexicography . Is n't that great ? So there are a lot of really good word-collecting sites out there right now , but the problem with some of them is that they 're not scientific enough . They show the word , but they do n't show any context : Where did it come from ? Who said it ? What newspaper was it in ? What book ? Because a word is like an archaeological artifact . If you do n't know the provenance or the source of the artifact , it 's not science -- it 's a pretty thing to look at . So a word without its source is like a cut flower . You know -- it 's pretty to look at for a while , but then it dies . It dies too fast . So this whole time I 've been saying , "" The dictionary , the dictionary , the dictionary , the dictionary . "" Not "" a dictionary , "" or "" dictionaries . "" And that 's because -- well , people use the dictionary to stand for the whole language . They use it synecdochically -- and one of the problems of knowing a word like "" synecdochically "" is that you really want an excuse to say synecdochically . This whole talk has just been an excuse to get me to the point where I could say synecdochically to all of you . So I 'm really sorry . But when you use a part of something -- like the dictionary is a part of the language , or a flag stands for the United States , a symbol of the country -- then you 're using it synecdochically . But the thing is , we could make the dictionary the whole language . If we get a bigger pan , then we can put all the words in . We can put in all the meanings . Does n ' t everyone want more meaning in their lives ? And we can make the dictionary not just be a symbol of the language -- we can make it be the whole language . You see , what I 'm really hoping for is that my son -- who turns seven this month -- I want him to barely remember that this is the form factor that dictionaries used to come in . This is what dictionaries used to look like . I want him to think of this kind of dictionary as an eight-track tape . It 's a format that died because it was n ' t useful enough . It was n ' t really what people needed . And the thing is , if we can put in all the words , no longer have that artificial distinction between good and bad , we can really describe the language like scientists . We can leave the aesthetic judgments to the writers and the speakers . If we can do that , then I can spend all my time fishing and I do n't have to be a traffic cop anymore . Thank you very much for your kind attention . </doc>

489,A1,"On Radio 4 's Today programme on 10 April , the Church of England Education Officer Canon John Hall argued - inaccurately - that campaigners against faith schools are proposing a ' French model ' , and made flawed claims about the church's contribution to the development of education . There are , of course , legitimate arguments to be made on both sides of the faith schools debate , but the BHA calls on Canon John Hall to stop muddying the water with false claims . ' The nation's children deserve a higher standard of debate on the expansion of faith schools . ' said Hanne Stinson , BHA executive director , ' Their future depends on it . ' The French secularist model Canon John Hall , on the Today programme , said : ' The sort of knee-jerk reaction answer to ' how do you educate for life in a diverse multi-cultural society ? ' by some people is that you leave faith outside the door , that you teach about religion but you certainly do n't teach religion . Now frankly , that 's the sort of French secularist model . ' The Canon is entirely incorrect in his assessment of the French system , and his criticism of humanist ( and also religious ) campaigners' approach to issues of religion and schools is similarly flawed . It is wrong to label as supporters of a French-type system those who call for inclusive community schools that accommodate those of all beliefs instead of religiously segregated schools . The French ignore religion ; faith schools evangelise about it . The middle road is objective , fair and balanced teaching about religions and non-religious beliefs that does not set out to persuade but to educate . This is what the BHA has long advocated and set as policy . This approach also has the support of many religious people - the Christian think tank Ekklesia , for example , has criticised John Hall's comments ( click here ) History of church schools Canon John Hall said : ' Of course , the churches founded the educational system - and 4700 schools are Church of England , another two and a half thousand are Catholic - so 7000 - there they are - and they 've been there since well before the state started doing anything . ' Clearly the only sensible approach to take to the debate over faith schools and academies today is to look at current circumstances . Because the Church of England in particular , however , has made great play of the longstanding involvement of the church in education as a defence of its continued involvement , we feel that the glowing narrative of church school history must be challenged . Most of today's church schools as institutions and the great majority as buildings were in fact created with public money . Since 1944 the church has contributed nothing to either running or building costs of voluntary-controlled schools and nothing to running costs and now only ( at most ) 10 % to building costs of voluntary-aided schools - but nothing , under recent government policies , to the current programme of rebuilding of secondary schools . The church in fact is the recipient of huge state aid , as are and will be the other religious groups as they gain their own faith schools . The church actually opposed state involvement in schools throughout the 19th century until it was finally forced to compromise in 1870 . When in 1798 Joseph Lancaster opened the first monitorial school in Southwark it aroused antagonism from the Church of England for its offering of non-sectarian education . In 1808 Bishops in the House of Lords opposed a Bill proposing a measure of free education . Small Government grants were introduced in the 1830s but when in 1839 the government proposed that the grants be conditional on inspection of schools and proposed also the formation of a non-sectarian State normal school for training of teachers , it was strongly opposed by the Church of England . The Church also defended its right to impose Anglican education on all by opposing bitterly the minimal conscience clause suggested by the government and sought by non-conformists , The introduction of a system of publicly funded education in 1870 was bitterly contested by the churches , who secured an interval to create new schools before the local school boards were allowed to start their own . In 1876 Joseph Chamberlain said that the Church party were trying everywhere ' to stunt the programme of the board school system , to prevent the erection of new schools and the provision of sufficient accommodation , to prevent the reduction of the cost of education [ ie school fees ] to the parents and to prevent the expenditure necessary to secure the efficiency of the schools ' . A notably sympathetic history , Church and State in English Education by Marjorie Cruickshank , states that ' Attempts to secure State intervention were baulked for many years by religious antagonisms . ' Brian Gates , in Faith Schools - Consensus or Conflict ? , says , ' Arguably , it was the tussling between [ the Anglican National Society and the non-conformist British and Foreign Schools Society ] that delayed the introduction of a fully comprehensive school system funded by public taxation . ' So the Churches have nothing to be proud of in their pre-1870 record . Rather , they held back education in England and Wales so that our position was notably worse than that of most of Europe and way behind that in Scotland , largely because of the religious beggar-my-neighbour opposition to any state intervention in schools .

You can read it and about it here and about the BHA's views on the Government's Education and Inspections Bill here We welcome the current renewed interest in faith schools , stimulated by the threats posed by the Government's Education Bill , and by the concerns of teachers , expressed through their unions , in the current conference season . </doc>

In turn you will receive a renewable 5 year agreement covering an exclusive area and the full support of the Click IT ! team . Training and Support From finance to running an IT business Harsha Popat worked in finance for 12 years . Her experience is serving her well in her new career as a franchisee running her own business teaching IT to young children . Having been made redundant from her finance job when she had her second child 10 years ago , Harsha decided to spend quality time with her children because she felt she did n't want to miss out those important early years with them . When her youngest started pre-school she began looking around for work . She had a friend who worked with Click IT ! Kids , a business teaching IT to children in nurseries , who told her it was term-time only and you could work it around school time . "" It sounded fantastic . It meant I could drop my kids off and pick them up and have some ' me ' time , "" she said . Harsha sent in her CV through her friend . Meanwhile she saw an advert in the local paper for teachers . "" I did n't know it was for Click IT ! Kids and I called up . The manager said she happened to be looking at my CV [ which she was given by my friend ] . "" Harsha was given full training in how to teach IT skills to children . Click IT ! Kids has detailed lesson plans and specially developed software . She then started working in two nurseries and gradually built up the number of nurseries she covered . She would typically finish her classes by 12 noon each day . Franchisee Harsha had so much confidence in the programme that last year she decided to take out a franchise with Click IT ! Kids . Her children are now 13 and 10 and she wanted to take on running her own business , so she set up Click IT ! Barnet . "" The kids love it , "" she says . "" The minute they know you are there , they can not wait for their turn . The younger ones are in groups of two and the older ones are taught in groups of up to three . You really notice the difference . If they start at two they are well ahead of their peers when they start school . It also benefits the nurseries as Click IT ! Kids takes away the burden they would normally have of teaching IT to children as part of the Early Years Foundation Scheme ( EYFS ) National Curriculum . "" The children progress at their own pace , starting with learning mouse and cursor skills . The lesson plans cover the early learning goals ; so in addition to IT skills they learn numeracy and literacy skills on the computer . "" When the children start school they can recognise their numbers and the alphabet . They are really confident about navigating around programmes and opening and shutting down the computer , "" says Harsha . Despite running the Click IT ! Barnet franchise , which includes administrative work and marketing to potential nurseries , Harsha still keeps her hand in at teaching and still mainly works during term time . For instance , she runs open days at the end of the summer term to recruit children for the autumn term . She covers Barnet , Hampstead and parts of Enfield in north London as part of her franchise . Harsha employs another teacher to give her more time to do marketing and gradually grow the business . She sometimes logs on at night , but never works later than 10pm . "" My financial background helps with running the business , "" she says , "" but I do not miss my former job . You can not compare the time you gain with your children . It 's fantastic . "" </doc>

I can only thank my parents in the way they bought me up never to feel different or disadvantaged . I have played sports all my life , driven , taken exams up to degree level , parachuted , scuba-dived ... in fact anything and everything that i would have done had i two eyes . Since about 11 years old i have not felt the need to tell people about my lack of sight - this is obviously a personal thing - and i know that it would never occur to anyone who met me that i was lacking vision on one eye .

448,A16,"5 miles from Garthyfog .... The Mawddach rises to the north of the Rhobell Fawr Mountain and flows through Ganllwyd , Llanelltyd and Penmaenpool and on through its long estuary to the sea at Barmouth . Upper reaches of the River Mawddach On the Mawddach , as with most other rivers in Gwynedd , there is a marked contrast between the upper reaches - steep and rocky , requiring great care in wet weather - and the gentler lower reaches , some of them quite short , where the course meanders through meadows or woodland . Bontwernddu pool on the River Wnion The Mawddach's largest tributary is the Wnion , a very fine sea trout river , while the smaller River Eden is also a valuable game fishery . Following a major pollution in 1984 , when 2000 adult salmon and sea trout were killed along with many thousands of juvenile fish , The Mawddach Trust was formed to restock the river from a purpose-built hatchery . The Mawddach and its tributaries contain neither grayling nor coarse fish . As a result , coarse angling in this part of Wales is confined to stillwaters . Insect life Apart from some early season olives and the ubiquitous iron blue and blue-winged olive , it is to the sedge flies , stoneflies and , in particular , terrestrial insects that river trout fishers should turn their attention on the Gwynedd rivers , and the Mawddach is no exception . Season dates and byelaws Salmon and sea trout : 20 March to 17 October . Fly and spinner only from 20 March to 15 April and from 7 October to 17 October . Trout ( non-migratory ) : 3 March to 30 September , except for downstream of the following points : Mawddach , Llenelltyd Bridge ( A470 ) Wnion , Dr Williams' School footbridge below Dolgellau . On these lower reaches the trout-fishing season dates are 31 May to 30 September .

1366,A8,"News Dozens of whales beached in Florida's Everglades BEACHED WHALES : Officials in boats monitor the scene where dozens of pilot whales are stranded in shallow water in a remote area of Florida's Everglades National Park , Wednesday , Dec. 4 . Photo : Associated Press / Lynne Sladky By Jane Sutton MIAMI ( Reuters ) – Ten whales have died and rescuers were trying to save dozens more that beached in Everglades National Park in southwest Florida , park and wildlife officials said on Wednesday . Forty-one whales were swimming freely in shallow waters near shore as rescuers tried with little success to coax them out into deeper water . Wildlife officers euthanized four whales because they could not be saved , the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration , or NOAA , said . NOAA said via Twitter that survival rates were typically low in such instances . They were believed to be short-finned pilot whales , typically found in deep water in tropical and temperate areas . Biologists will perform necropsies on the dead whales to try to determine why they were stranded , NOAA said . "" Pilot whales are common stranders . They tend to do this , "" Friar said . When rescued , she said , "" they tend to rebeach themselves . "" "" This area of the park is probably the most challenging for something like this . When the tide goes out , there 's hundreds of yards of very shallow shoals , "" Friar said . </doc>

492,A8,"Gazan butcher Mohammed Hadad opens the door to a walk-in fridge , releasing a pungent smell of rotting meat into his shop . The military action has come as Gaza suffers food shortages With Gaza facing rolling power cuts after an Israeli airstrike hit Gaza City's only power plant , Mr Hadad's refrigerators are no longer operational . Large cuts of lamb hanging from steel hooks are spoiling . Until now , Mr Hadad has been moving the meat between his home and shop depending on where there is electricity . But now he is stumped - there is no power in either building . "" In three hours it will be completely spoilt , "" he says , standing under a motionless roof fan . "" We need to find a solution to this . "" Guns and butter Palestinians in the Gaza Strip are feeling more besieged than usual as the tense stand-off continues with Israel over the fate of a captured soldier held in the territory . Butcher Mohammed Hadad is seeing his meat turn rotten The international community cut aid to the Palestinians in March when Hamas took office . Palestinians will tell you things have got worse . Every few hours , sonic booms rattle the city , waking people from their sleep and setting off car alarms . Israel has shelled targets in the territory . With no supplies coming into the territory from Israel , food and fuel is running short here , and some international aid agencies are warning of a possible humanitarian crisis if the blockade continues . Israel says its military operation will end if the kidnapped Cpl Gilad Shalit is freed and there is an end to rocket attacks into Israel from northern Gaza . Israel says it is hoping to pressurise the militants into releasing the soldier . But until now this has not happened . Deal hope Like Mr Hadad , many Palestinians want an end to their latest hardship . But most believe that Israel must release Palestinian prisoners in exchange for the 19-year-old soldier's life . Petrol supplies are running low "" There needs to be more negotiations , "" says Mr Hadad . "" A prisoner exchange is the only way to resolve this crisis . "" Across the city , people have been looking for fuel for their cars and also to power their generators . Ataf Timraz , 30 , whose family owns two petrol stations and supplies fuel to 30 others , says that they have run out of fuel . As he sits in his office , a worker hoses down the garage forecourt and waves customers away . "" People think we have stored petrol , that we 're hiding it , "" says Mr Timraz , explaining people's frustrations . Family history Most Palestinians are trying to carry on with their daily lives , but the threat looms of a major Israeli military operation . Why should we release the soldier for nothing ? Zami Shalouf Beit Hanoun In Beit Hanoun , a town in northern Gaza , residents are tense about a major Israeli military operation . This is the site from where many of the rockets are fired by Palestinians into Israel .

1663,A16,"Quimby is an alternative rock band popular on the Hungarian music scene . Enjoying large crowds across the nation , they have had successes at music festivals such as the Sziget Festival . Together for over 25 years , the band has a large collection of studio albums and one live CD / DVD combo to their credit . The band originated in the industrial town of Dunaújváros under the name ' Október ' , playing covers . By the end of high school , the band dispersed . The Kiss brothers , Tibor and Endre , got another group together in 1991 , and renamed it ' Quimby ' . 1991 to 1995 : Saloon start - Jerrycan Dance In 1992 the band's first cassette entitled Up Side Down was made available , featuring English-language tunes like "" Sea , "" "" Stink , "" "" I Give You My Shoes , "" "" Up Side Down , "" "" Never Get By , "" and "" Policeman "" . The band's style was compared to the chansons and cabaret songs from the period between the World Wars . The band played at pubs in Pest . By 1993 the personnel consisted of Tibor Kiss ( vocals and guitar ) , Endre Kiss ( guitar ) , Livius Varga ( percussion and vocals ) , Tamás Szén Molnár ( saxophone ) , Ferenc Mikuli ( bass guitar ) , and Ákos Medve ( drums ) . In 1993 they recorded their second album , Sip of Story . This album also came out on cassette and had English lyrics . During this period the band was one of the most successful club bands in Budapest , and also popular on the college and festival circuit . At this point the elder Kiss brother , Endre , left the band . He was replaced by a young piano player , Szilárd Balanyi , who was born in Balatonfüred . With this new line-up the band recorded its next album , Jerrycan Dance , which came out on CD but in a limited edition . This album is also in English and it begins to show some of the main characteristics which are seen in the present band . 1995 to 1997 : Language change - Majom-tangó In 1995 , the band decided to focus more on writing songs in Hungarian . By the summer of 1996 the new album was finished : Majom-tangó ( Monkey Tango ) . This album contains mostly Hungarian songs , but there are three English ones . The album has an eclectic style : there are several folk songs featured in the usual chanson-epic style of Quimby , especially Roma and Latin folk music ; then reggae and psychedelic effects are incorporated . Majom-tangó is the direct antecedent of their present style . The release of Majom-tangó immediately led to a rise in popularity on the Hungarian music scene . The band moved from being a phenomenon on the alternative stage to wider popularity with the appearance of Diligramm ( Loonygramme ) in December 1997 . Diligramm is a complete work of a mature band . The lyrics are crisper , the musical palette more colorful ; the band found its own style . The CD was introduced by a video and single , "" Once There Was a Time "" , and by a memorable CD release concert . Quimby enjoyed many successes in their live performances , with more concerts in front of larger audiences . In the spring of 1998 the Hungarian press chose Diligramm the album of the year . The new album Ékszerelmére was highly anticipated even before it was released in November 1999 . Producing the record proved a little complex when early in the year Livius Varga lost the tape containing the ideas of for new songs while he was traveling on the tram in Budapest . Ékszerelmére is even more mature and composed than the previous album . The music is strict but playful , uniform but discursive , realistic but ascendent , and traditionalist . While the band uses the implementations of modern music , the lyrics are cruel and ironic ; stories and verbal psychedelia are present . After the recording of Ékszerelmére the band released Tamás Molnár ( saxophone ) . After a long search his place was filled by József Kárpáti , a trumpet and piano player from the band ' Andersen ' . The band stepped on stage at that year's Sziget Festival in this form . During this period the band performed at festival concerts in Hungary and abroad , and went on a mini-tour of Germany . In the spring of 2001 Quimby released a new album called Morzsák és Szilánkok ( Crumbs and Splinters ) . It contained remixes featuring unknown , young , talented remixers , together with concert recordings of older songs . Tibor Kiss singer said the album presented the material "" with a sort of continuous modality , like a film , building upon each other one after the other "" . In 2002 , the album called Káosz Amigos ( Chaos Amigos ) did not disappoint fans . The album takes the musical oeuvre of Quimby to a new point of view . It is a musical-lyrical adventure in a troubled , intensive , vibrating , sensitive , dynamic , tragic , humorous , often tragicomic world . This album contains 10 songs in 43 minutes . In spite of the shorter playtime the album is a colorful , exciting and amusing musical roller-coaster . The songs are memorable but not hits in the usual sense . There are Spanish-like chansons with stiff rhythms , interesting guitar work , agile and bop songs . There are also fancy , moderate , slow songs and rap , even childhood sayings . The album features percussion instruments , guitar , bass , keyboards , modern electronics and trumpet by the newest member of the band , József Kárpáti . The band had just completed touring the new album in Hungary when frontman Tibor Kiss needed an extended break for rest and relaxation , so the band went on hiatus . Though its was n't known ahead of time how long the break would be , the pause lasted until 2004 . After an intensive probation period and a return concert , Quimby rejoined the Hungarian public music scene once again with enormous power . Full-house concerts were held in Budapest and other venues , along with a successful "" Night Invasion "" concert in Spring 2004 and appearances at the big summer festivals , including the Sziget Festival . The band continued from where they left off : reviewers and fans said the band was in good shape , perhaps even better than before . 2005 to present : Kilégzés and Family Tugedör The album Kilégzés ( Exhalation , October 2005 ) became an important work in the band's history . It is an interesting milestone because it opened a new era from an artistic point of view . Memories from their previous phase are presented in a new context , in a re-evaluated form . Tibor Kiss does n't mince now , there is no nostalgia , no great truths revealed , but only the music with its ironic , emotional , expressive style . In 2006 the band reached the 15-year milestone . Quimby celebrated this special jubilee by publishing a greatest hits recording and DVD called Family Tugedör . They also gave a double concert in the Katona József Theatre , one in the Petőfi Csarnok venue and a concert on 1 January 2007 called "" Magic Music "" . The work continues with two releases in 2009 , an EP ( Ajjajjaj ) and a full length album ( Lármagyűjtögető ) . </doc>

1128,A17,"Mona Hatoum Gabriel Coxhead reviews the French artist's Tate Modern retrospective In 1975 , while Mona Hatoum was briefly visiting London from her native Beirut , the Lebanese Civil War broke out , preventing her from returning home for several years . This is the oft-repeated foundational myth of Hatoum's career ( she now lives and works in London and Berlin ) , the spur for the core concerns that recur throughout her mostly impressive body of work : ideas to do with violence and displacement , borders and contested territories , and the problematic notion of homeland ( a concept from which , being from a Palestinian family exiled in Lebanon , she was , after all , doubly distant ) . The dominant mood of Hatoum's works , accordingly , is one of unease , dislocation , danger . Domestic objects appear sinisterly transformed – as in the paired works Paravent ( French for ' folding screen ' ) and Daybed ( both 2008 ) , which take the form of nightmarishly enlarged , horribly sharp-looking cheesegraters ; or the scores of metal household-goods , in the installation Homebound ( 2000 ) , through which an electric current passes , powering bare lightbulbs and emitting a malevolent crackling sound . In Light Sentence ( 1992 ) , meanwhile , another naked bulb dangles amidst an enclosure of metal-mesh lockers , its mechanical pivoting sending grids of shadows skittering and stretching about the gallery walls , creating a disorientating , vaguely sickening effect . Such works must be among the most instantly familiar in recent British art , but are no less thrillingly effective for that . Less well known , though , and where this retrospective really comes into its own , are Hatoum's early performance pieces . Documented through text , photographs and occasional video , and scattered throughout the nonchronological display , these show Hatoum developing her focus on the body – typically her own – as a metaphor for political oppression and isolation : whether trapped inside a transparent container , slathered and slipping in liquid clay ( Under Siege , 1982 ) or lying motionless for hours on a table , wrapped in plastic sheeting and smeared with bloody viscera , as a soundtrack plays politicians' facile statements about the Lebanese peace process ( The Negotiating Table , 1983 ) . Yet perhaps most interesting , in view of her subsequent work , are a pair of film / performance pieces from 1980 , made while she was a student , in which live footage of herself and audience members is mixed with prerecorded segments of naked body parts or X-ray imagery , as if the roving camera was somehow capable of seeing through layers of clothing and skin . These themes of surveillance and trespass would culminate in what is arguably Hatoum's most captivating work , Corps Étranger ( 1994 ) . Filmed using an endoscopic camera , it makes for almost literally absorbing viewing , as you peer down into footage projected as a circle on the floor , scanning across her body 's seemingly gigantic surface before plunging deep into glistening , peristaltically pulsing cavities . The mixed sense of invasion and invitation is both discomfiting and compelling , as Hatoum's figure is portrayed as a kind of hinterland , a liminal territory between known externalities and alien-looking , interior zones . Her work of recent years , unfortunately , mostly does n't have the same impact . She still has a great way with small , cogent , ephemeral pieces : little weavings made from hair , or altered paper maps . But on a larger scale , the visual metaphors often tend to come off as rather heavy-handed . Hot Spot III ( 2009 ) , a giant globe with the country outlines drawn in blazing neon , is a comment on the globalised nature of political conflict . Cellules ( 2012 – 13 ) is an array of prison containers with amoebalike glass globules trapped inside – both are forms of cells , geddit ? The same essential ideas , it seems , are being recycled , but to diminishing effect , as Hatoum apparently settles into exploring what for her is that most ironic of concepts – familiar territory .

1089,A14,"GPU-Based Parallel Integration of Large Numbers of Independent ODE Systems ∗ arXiv : 1611 . 02274v1 [ cs . MS ] 6 Nov 2016 Kyle E. Niemeyer † School of Mechanical , Industrial , & Manufacturing Engineering , Oregon State University , OR , USA Chih-Jen Sung Department of Mechanical Engineering , University of Connecticut , Storrs , CT , USA 9 June 2014 Abstract The task of integrating a large number of independent ODE systems arises in various scientific and engineering areas . For nonstiff systems , common explicit integration algorithms can be used on GPUs , where individual GPU threads concurrently integrate independent ODEs with different initial conditions or parameters . One example is the fifth-order adaptive Runge – Kutta – Cash – Karp ( RKCK ) algorithm . In the case of stiff ODEs , standard explicit algorithms require impractically small time-step sizes for stability reasons , and implicit algorithms are therefore commonly used instead to allow larger time steps and reduce the computational expense . However , typical high-order implicit algorithms based on backwards differentiation formulae ( e.g. , VODE , LSODE ) involve complex logical flow that causes severe thread divergence when implemented on GPUs , limiting the performance . Therefore , alternate algorithms are needed . A GPUbased Runge – Kutta – Chebyshev ( RKC ) algorithm can handle moderate levels of stiffness and performs significantly faster than not only an equivalent CPU version but also a CPU-based implicit algorithm ( VODE ) based on results shown in the literature . In this chapter , we present the mathematical background , implementation details , and source code for the RKCK and RKC algorithms for use integrating large numbers of independent systems of ODEs on GPUs . In addition , brief performance comparisons are shown for each algorithm , demonstrating the potential benefit of moving to GPU-based ODE integrators . ∗ Final version published in Numerical Computations with GPUs ( 2014 ) Springer International Publishing , Ch. 8 , pp. 159 – 182 . V. Kindratenko ( Ed . ) . doi : 10 . 1007 / 978-3-319-06548-9_8 † Corresponding author ; Email : kyle.niemeyer@oregonstate.edu 1 Introduction In a number of science and engineering applications , researchers are faced with the solution of large numbers of independent systems of ordinary differential equations ( ODEs ) . One prominent example is simulation of reactive flows for modeling combustion [ 1 – 5 ] , atmospheric chemistry [ 6 , 7 ] , and groundwater transport [ 8 , 9 ] , where operator splitting [ 10 , 11 ] decouples the solution of the fluid transport ( e.g. , advection , diffusion ) and chemical kinetics terms . This results in large numbers of independent ODEs for conservation of chemical species masses , with one system for each spatial location . The solution of the aggregate of these ODEs consumes most of the total wall-clock time of such simulations , > 90 % in some cases . Simulations of electrical behavior in cardiac tissue use a similar operator splitting technique , which results in ODE systems for cell membrane dynamics [ 12 , 13 ] . Other areas that deal with solving many independent systems of ODEs include systems biology [ 14 , 15 ] and Monte Carlo methods for sensitivity analysis of ODEs [ 16 – 18 ] . In such problems , large numbers of the same governing ODEs with different initial conditions and / or input parameters must be integrated ; since each system is independent , the entire set of ODEs can be integrated concurrently . While performance can be improved by using parallel central processing unit ( CPU ) methods , this embarrassingly parallel problem is especially well-suited to acceleration with the thread-based parallelism of graphics processing units ( GPUs ) , as demonstrated for reactive-flow simulations [ 19 – 22 ] . In particular , Niemeyer and Sung [ 22 ] recently developed a GPU-based approach for the integration of moderately stiff chemical kinetics ODEs using explicit integration algorithms , using an adaptive fifth-order Runge – Kutta – Cash – Karp ( RKCK ) method for nonstiff cases and a stabilized second-order Runge – Kutta – Chebyshev ( RKC ) method for problems with greater stiffness . For large numbers of ODEs , they demonstrated that the GPU-based RKCK and RKC algorithms performed up to 126 and 65 times faster , respectively , than CPU versions of the same algorithm on a single CPU core . Furthermore , with moderate levels of stiffness , the GPU-based RKC offered a speedup factor of 57 compared to a conventional implicit algorithm executed in parallel on a six-core CPU . The specific acceleration demonstrated depending on the problem studied ( e.g. , the kinetic mechanism ) and number of ODEs considered . Due to the favorable performance of these methods , in this chapter we present the integration algorithms , associated GPU source code , and implementation details so that interested readers can apply them to more general applications ( e.g. , the areas described above ) . 2 Mathematical Background In this chapter , we represent a generic system of ODEs using d ~ y = f ~ ( t , ~ y ( t ) , ~ g ) , dt ( 1 ) where ~ y ( t ) is the vector of unknown dependent variables at some time t , f ~ is the right-hand-side vector function , and ~ g is a vector of constant parameters ( e.g. , pressure or temperature for chemical kinetics ) . The size of ~ y ( i.e. , the number of equations / unknowns ) is N. For the types of problems with which we are concerned here , a large number of ODE systems , Node , each given by Eq. ( 1 ) must be integrated independently from some time t = tn to tn + 1 , with different initial conditions ~ y ( tn ) and constant parameters ~ g for each system . The numerical approximation to the exact solution ~ y ( tn ) is ~ yn , and the step size for a given step is δtn = tn + 1 − tn . Nonstiff ODEs , or those with little stiffness , can be solved using explicit integration methods . Many such methods exist , and algorithms can be classified in general into Runge – Kutta and linear 1 i ai 1 2 3 4 5 6 1 5 3 10 3 5 1 7 8 j bij ci c ∗ i 37 378 2825 27648 250 621 125 594 18575 48384 13525 55296 277 14336 1 4 0 1 5 3 40 3 10 11 − 54 1631 55296 9 40 9 − 10 5 2 175 512 6 5 − 70 27 575 13824 35 27 44275 110592 253 4096 1 2 3 4 5 0 512 1771 0 Table 1 : Coefficients for the fifth-order Runge – Kutta – Cash – Karp method , adopted from Press et al. [ 26 ] . multistep methods , and also into explicit or implicit methods ; see Hairer and Wanner [ 23 ] for more details . Stiffness , a concept somewhat difficult to quantify , refers to the quality of an ODE making standard explicit methods perform poorly due to the requirement for unreasonably small time-step sizes – otherwise the solutions become unstable and oscillate wildly [ 24 ] . Traditionally , implicit integration algorithms such as those based on backwards difference formulas have been used to handle stiff equations , but these require expensive linear algebra operations on the Jacobian matrix ( e.g. , LU decomposition , matrix inversion ) . The complex logical flow of such operations results in highly divergent instructions across different initial conditions , making implicit algorithms unsuitable for operation on GPUs . In fact , Stone and Davis [ 21 ] implemented a traditional high-order implicit algorithm on GPUs , and found that it performed only slightly better than a multi-core CPU version of the same algorithm would . While implicit algorithms may be required for ODE systems with extreme levels of stiffness ( suggesting that new solutions need to be found for GPU acceleration of such problems ) , other options can be used for cases of little-to-moderate stiffness . Here , we describe two integration algorithms suitable for use solving many independent systems of ODEs on GPUs . 2.1 Runge – Kutta – Cash – Karp For nonstiff ODEs , an appropriate explicit algorithm is the fifth-order Runge – Kutta method developed by Cash and Karp [ 25 ] : the RKCK method . The RKCK method estimates the local truncation error using an embedded fourth-order method , by taking the difference between the fourth - and fifth-order solutions . It then uses this estimate to adaptively select the step size [ 26 ] . Using the terminology established above , the RKCK formulas – which also apply to any general 2 fifth-order Runge – Kutta method – are k ~ 1 = δtn f ~ ( tn , ~ yn , ~ g ) , ( 2 ) ~ k2 = δtn f ~ tn + a2 δtn , ~ yn + b21 ~ k1 , ~ g ( 3 ) , ~ k3 = δtn f ~ tn + a3 δtn , ~ yn + b31 ~ k1 + b32 ~ k2 , ~ g ( 4 ) , ~ k4 = δtn f ~ tn + a4 δtn , ~ yn + b41 ~ k1 + b42 ~ k2 + b43 ~ k3 , ~ g ( 5 ) , ~ k5 = δtn f ~ tn + a5 δtn , ~ yn + b51 ~ k1 + b52 ~ k2 + b53 ~ k3 + b54 ~ k4 , ~ g ~ k6 = δtn f ~ tn + a6 δtn , ~ yn + b61 ~ k1 + b62 ~ k2 + b63 ~ k3 + b64 ~ k4 + b65 ~ k5 , ~ g ~ yn + 1 = ~ yn + c1 ~ k1 + c2 ~ k2 + c3 ~ k3 + c4 ~ k4 + c5 ~ k5 + c6 ~ k6 , ∗ ~ yn + 1 = ~ yn + c ∗ 1 ~ k1 + c ∗ 2 ~ k2 + c ∗ 3 ~ k3 + c ∗ 4 ~ k4 + c ∗ 5 ~ k5 + c ∗ 6 ~ k6 , ( 6 ) ,, ( 7 ) ( 8 ) ( 9 ) ∗ where ~ yn + 1 is the fifth-order solution and ~ yn + 1 is the solution of the embedded fourth-order method . The RKCK coefficients are given in Table 1 . The local error ∆ n + 1 is estimated using the difference between the fourth - and fifth-order solutions : ∗ ∆ n + 1 = ~ yn + 1 − ~ yn + 1 = 6 X ( ci − c ∗ i ) ~ ki . ( 10 ) i = 1 Then , this error is compared against a desired accuracy , ∆ 0 , defined by ∆ 0 = ε | ~ yn | + δtn f ~ ( tn , ~ yn , ~ g ) + δ , ( 11 ) where ε is a tolerance level and δ represents a small value ( e.g. , 10 − 30 ) . When the estimated error rises above the desired accuracy ( ∆ n + 1 > ∆ 0 ) , the algorithm rejects the current step and calculates a smaller step size . Correspondingly , the algorithms accepts a step with error at or below the desired accuracy ( ∆ n + 1 ≤ ∆ 0 ) and calculates a new step size for the next step using ! 1 / 5 ∆ 0 , i if ∆ n + 1 ≤ ∆ 0 , or S δt max n ∆ n + 1 , i i δtnew = ! 1 / 4 ∆ 0 , i if ∆ n + 1 > ∆ 0 . S δtn max i ∆ n + 1 , i ( 12 ) Here , i represents the ith element of the related vector and S denotes a safety factor slightly smaller than unity ( e.g. , 0.9 ) . Equation ( 12 ) is used to calculate the next time step size both for an accepted step and also for a new , smaller step size in the case of a step rejection . In practice , step size decreases and increases are limited to factors of ten and five , respectively [ 26 ] . 2.2 Runge – Kutta – Chebyshev For ODEs with moderate levels of stiffness , one alternative to implicit algorithms is a stabilized explicit scheme such as the RKC method [ 27 – 32 ] . While the RKC method is explicit , it handles stiffness through additional stages – past the first two required for second-order accuracy – that extend its stability domain along the negative real axis of eigenvalues . Our RKC implementation is taken from Sommeijer et al. [ 31 ] and Verwer et al. [ 32 ] . Following the same terminology as above , the formulas for the second-order RKC are w ~ 0 = ~ yn , ( 13 ) 3 w ~ 1 = w ~ 0 + μ ̃ 1 δtn f ~ 0 , ( 14 ) w ~ j = ( 1 − μj − νj ) w ~ 0 + μj w ~ j − 1 + νj w ~ j − 2 + μ ̃ j δtn f ~ j − 1 + γ ̃ j δtn f ~ 0 , j = 2 , ... , s , ~ yn + 1 = w ~ s , ( 15 ) ( 16 ) where s is the total number of stages and w ~ j are internal vectors for the stages . The right-hand-side ~ derivative vector function , fj , is evaluated at each stage , such that f ~ j = f ~ ( tn + cj δtn , w ~ j , ~ g ) . The recursive nature of w ~ j allows the use of only five arrays for storage . The coefficients used in Eqs . ( 14 ) and ( 15 ) can be obtained analytically for any number of stages s ≥ 2 : μ ̃ 1 = b1 ω1 , γ ̃ j = − aj − 1 μ ̃ j , w0 = 1 + κ , s2 2bj ω0 , bj − 1 νj = − bj , bj − 2 b0 = b2 , b1 = 1 , ω0 μj = ω1 = Ts0 ( ω0 ) , Ts00 ( ω0 ) 2bj ω1 , bj − 1 Tj00 ( ω0 ) μ ̃ j = bj = 2 , Tj0 ( ω0 ) aj = 1 − bj Tj ( ω0 ) , ( 17 ) ( 18 ) ( 19 ) for j = 2 , ... , s , where κ ≥ 0 is the damping parameter ( e.g. , κ = 2 / 13 [ 31 , 32 ] ) . The Chebyshev polynomials of the first kind , Tj ( x ) with first and second derivatives Tj0 ( x ) and Tj00 ( x ) , respectively , are defined recursively as Tj ( x ) = 2xTj − 1 ( x ) − Tj − 2 ( x ) , j = 2 , ... , s , ( 20 ) where T0 ( x ) = 1 and T1 ( x ) = x . The cj used in the function evaluations are c1 = cj = c2 c2 , ≈ 0 T2 ( ω0 ) 4 Ts0 ( ω0 ) Tj00 ( ω0 ) Ts00 ( ω0 ) Tj0 ( ω0 ) ( 21 ) ≈ j2 − 1 , s2 − 1 2 ≤ j ≤ s − 1 , cs = 1 . ( 22 ) ( 23 ) As with the RKCK method in Sec. 2.1 , the RKC method can also be used with an adaptive time stepping method for error control , as given by Sommeijer et al. [ 31 ] . The error accrued in taking the step tn + 1 = tn + δtn and obtaining ~ yn + 1 is estimated using 4 2 ∆ n + 1 = ( ~ yn − ~ yn + 1 ) + δtn ( f ~ n + f ~ n + 1 ) . 5 5 ( 24 ) We then obtain the weighted RMS norm of error using this error estimate with absolute and relative tolerances : ∆ n + 1 k ∆ n + 1 kRMS = √ , ~ T N 2 ~ ~ T = A + R · max ( | ~ yn | , | ~ yn + 1 | ) , ( 25 ) ( 26 ) ~ is the vector of where N represents the number of unknown variables as defined previously , A absolute tolerances , and R is the relative tolerance . The norm k · k2 indicates the Euclidean or L2 norm . If k ∆ n + 1 kRMS ≤ 1 , the step is accepted ; otherwise , it is rejected and repeated using a 4 smaller step size . Finally , a new step size is calculated using the weighted RMS norm of error for the current and prior steps , as well as the associated step sizes , via δtn + 1 = min ( 10 , max ( 0 . 1 , f )) δtn , f = 0.8 1 / ( p + 1 ) k ∆ n kRMS 1 / ( p + 1 ) k ∆ n + 1 kRMS δtn δtn − 1 ( 27 ) 1 ! 1 / ( p + 1 ) , k ∆ n kRMS ( 28 ) where p = 2 , the order of the algorithm . We use Eq. ( 27 ) with a modified relation to calculate a new step size for a step rejection : 0.8 f = . ( 29 ) 1 / ( p + 1 ) k ∆ n kRMS Determining the initial time step size requires special consideration . First , the algorithm takes a tentative integration step , using the inverse of the spectral radius σ – the magnitude of the largest eigenvalue – of the Jacobian matrix as the step size . Then , after estimating the error associated with this tentative step , it calculates a new step size following a similar procedure to that given in Eqs . ( 27 ) and ( 28 ) : 1 , σ ∆ 0 = δt0 f ~ ( t0 + δt0 , ~ y0 + δt0 f ~ ( t0 , ~ y0 )) − f ~ ( t0 , ~ y0 ) , δt0 = δt1 = 0.1 δt0 1 / 2 ( 30 ) ( 31 ) ( 32 ) , k ∆ 0 kRMS ~ 0 kRMS is evaluated in the same manner as k ∆ ~ n + 1 kRMS using Eq. ( 25 ) . where k ∆ After selecting the optimal time step size to control local error , the algorithm next determines the optimal number of RKC stages in order to remain stable . Due to stiffness , too few stages could lead to instability ; in contrast , using more stages than required would add unnecessary computational effort . The number of stages is determined using the spectral radius and time step size : s = 1 + p 1 + 1.54 δtn σ , ( 33 ) as suggested by Sommeijer et al. [ 31 ] , where the value 1.54 is related to the stability boundary of the algorithm . Note that s may vary between time steps due to a changing spectral radius and time step size . We recommend using a nonlinear power method [ 31 ] to calculate the spectral radius with our RKC implementation ; this choice costs an additional vector to store the computed eigenvector , but avoids storing or calculating the Jacobian matrix directly . Following Sommeijer et al. [ 31 ] , our RKC implementation estimates the spectral radius every 25 ( internal ) steps or after a step rejection . 3 Source Code Next , we provide implementation details and source code for the GPU versions of the algorithms described above . The number of unknowns ( and corresponding equations ) N is represented with the variable NEQN , and the number of ODE systems Node is defined as numODE in the following code . In order for the GPU algorithms to offer a performance increase over CPU algorithms , Node should be relatively large . Although the exact number of ODEs where the GPU algorithm becomes faster than its CPU equivalent is problem dependent , Niemeyer and Sung [ 22 ] showed that a GPU implementation of the RKCK algorithm for chemical kinetics outperforms an equivalent serial CPU 5 version for as little as 128 ODE systems . All operations are given here in double precision , although depending on the particular needs of the specific application single-precision calculations may be preferable to reduce the computational expense . In order to take advantage of global memory coalescing on the GPU , we recommend storing the the set of dependent variable vectors ~ yi , where i = 1 , ... , Node , in a single one-dimensional array , where variables corresponding to the same unknown for consecutive systems sit adjacent in memory . ~ is a two-dimensional matrix with Node rows and N columns , where the ith row In other words , if Y ~ should be stored in memory as a one-dimensional array in contains the unknown vector ~ yi , then Y column-major ordering . This ensures that adjacent GPU threads in the same warp access adjacent global memory locations when reading or writing equivalent array elements . See Kirk and Hwu [ 33 ] or Jang et al. [ 34 ] for more details and examples on global memory coalescing . The following code snippet shows the proper loading of a host array yHost from an arbitrary array y that contains initial conditions for all ODEs : 1 2 double * yHost ; yHost = ( double * ) malloc ( numODE * NEQN * sizeof ( double )) ; 3 4 5 6 7 8 for ( int i = 0 ; i < numODE ; ++ i ) { for ( int j = 0 ; j < NEQN ; ++ j ) { yHost [ i + numODE * j ] = y [ i ] [ j ] ; } } A similar procedure should be used for the constant parameter vector ~ g if needed . Next , the GPU global memory arrays should be declared and initialized , and the block / grid dimensions set up using 1 2 double * yDevice ; cudaMalloc (( void ** ) & yDevice , numODE * NEQN * sizeof ( double )) ; 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 int blockSize ; if ( numODE < 4194304 ) { blockSize = 64 ; } else if ( numODE < 8388608 ) { blockSize = 128 ; } else if ( numODE < 16777216 ) { blockSize = 256 ; } else { blockSize = 512 ; } dim3 dimBlock ( blockSize , 1 ) ; dim3 dimGrid ( numODE / dimBlock . x , 1 ) ; Here , we use simple one-dimensional block and grid dimensions ; reshaping the grid should not affect performance , but can be done for convenience . We chose 64 as the block size for problems with less than 4,194,304 ODEs based on experience for chemical kinetics problems [ 22 ] . The size should remain a power of two , but different block sizes may be optimal for other problems . The final step is to set up the ODE integration loop and kernel function execution . The integration driver kernel , to be described shortly , will perform internal sub-stepping as necessary to reach the specified end time . Depending on the objectives , there are various ways to approach this : • If only the final integrated results are needed , then a single GPU kernel can be invoked . • If intermediate integration results are needed , then an acceptable outer step size over which results will be spaced should be chosen , and the GPU kernel should be invoked inside a loop . 6 We will leave the code as general as possible by following the second approach , although modifications should be made depending on the desired functionality . In both cases , the global memory array holding the variables to be integrated needs to be transferred to the GPU before , and from the GPU after , each kernel invocation . 1 2 3 // set initial time double t = t0 ; double tNext = t + h ; 4 5 6 7 while ( t < tEnd ) { // transfer memory to GPU cudaMemcpy ( yDevice , yHost , numODE * NEQN * sizeof ( double ) , c uda Me mc py Hos tT oD ev i c e ) ; 8 intDriver <<< dimGrid , dimBlock > > > ( t , tNext , numODE , gDevice , yDevice ) ; 9 10 // transfer memory back to CPU cudaMemcpy ( yHost , yDevice , numODE * NEQN * sizeof ( double ) , c uda Me mc py Dev ic eT oH o s t ) ; 11 12 13 t = tNext ; tNext + = h ; 14 15 16 } 17 18 19 cudaFree ( gDevice ) ; cudaFree ( yDevice ) ; Here , t0 refers to the initial time , tEnd the desired final time , and h the outer step size . In the current form , each outer integration step performed by the GPU will be a "" restart "" integration , meaning no information about previous steps ( e.g. , error estimates , step sizes ) will be used to assist the startup . This is necessary in certain applications such as reactive-flow simulations ( and other simulation methods that use operator splitting ) , where after each outer step integration results are combined with changes due to fluid transport , thereby invalidating stored integration information . However , where possible , better performance may be obtained by transferring the appropriate data from the GPU and used in the next overall integration step . The next code snippet contains the general integration driver kernel , suitable for either algorithm : 1 2 3 4 5 __global__ void intDriver ( const double t , const double tEnd , const int numODE , const double * gGlobal , double * yGlobal ) { // unique thread ID , based on local ID in block and block ID int tid = threadIdx . x + ( blockDim . x * blockIdx . x ) ; 6 7 8 // ensure thread within limit if ( tid < numODE ) { 9 10 11 // local array with initial values double yLocal [ NEQN ] ; 12 13 14 // constant parameter ( s ) double gLocal = gGlobal [ tid ] ; 15 16 17 18 19 // load local array with initial values from global array for ( int i = 0 ; i < NEQN ; ++ i ) { yLocal [ i ] = yGlobal [ tid + numODE * i ] ; } 20 21 22 // call integrator for one time step integrator ( t , tEnd , yLocal , gGlobal ) ; 23 7 // update global array with integrated values for ( int i = 0 ; i < NEQN ; ++ i ) { yGlobal [ tid + numODE * i ] = yLocal [ i ] ; } } 24 25 26 27 28 29 } The function integrator should be replaced with rkckDriver or rkcDriver ( given below ) depending on the desired integration algorithm . 3.1 RKCK Code In the following , the source code for the RKCK driver device function is given in functional snippets . First , the minimum and maximum allowable time step sizes are defined , and the initial step size is set as half the integration time . 1 2 3 __device__ void rkckDriver ( double t , const double tEnd , const double g , double * y ) { 4 5 6 7 // maximum and minimum allowable step sizes const double hMax = fabs ( tEnd - t ) ; const double hMin = 1.0 e -20 ; 8 9 10 // initial step size double h = 0.5 * fabs ( tEnd - t ) ; Then , inside the time integration loop , the algorithm takes a trial integration step and estimates the error of that step . 1 2 // integrate until specified end time while ( t < tEnd ) { 3 4 5 // limit step size based on remaining time h = fmin ( tEnd - t , h ) ; 6 7 8 // y and error vectors temporary until error determined double yTemp [ NEQN ] , yErr [ NEQN ] ; 9 10 11 12 // evaluate derivative double F [ NEQN ] ; dydt ( t , y , g , F ) ; 13 14 15 // take a trial step rkckStep ( t , y , g , F , h , yTemp , yErr ) ; 16 17 18 19 20 21 // calculate error double err = 0.0 ; int nanFlag = 0 ; for ( int i = 0 ; i < NEQN ; ++ i ) { if ( isnan ( yErr [ i ] ) ) nanFlag = 1 ; 22 23 24 25 err = fmax ( err , fabs ( yErr [ i ] / ( fabs ( y [ i ] ) + fabs ( h * F [ i ] ) + TINY ))) ; } err / = eps ; If the error is too large , the step size is decreased and the step retaken ; otherwise , the algorithm accepts the step and calculates the next step size , then repeats the process . 8 // check if error too large if (( err > 1.0 ) || isnan ( err ) || ( nanFlag == 1 )) { // step failed , error too large if ( isnan ( err ) || ( nanFlag == 1 )) { h * = P1 ; } else { h = fmax ( SAFETY * h * pow ( err , PSHRNK ) , P1 * h ) ; } 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 } else { // step accepted t + = h ; 10 11 12 13 if ( err > ERRCON ) { h = SAFETY * h * pow ( err , PGROW ) ; } else { h * = 5.0 ; } 14 15 16 17 18 19 // ensure step size is bounded h = fmax ( hMin , fmin ( hMax , h )) ; 20 21 22 for ( int i = 0 ; i < NEQN ; ++ i ) y [ i ] = yTemp [ i ] ; 23 24 } 25 } 26 27 } The device function dydt evaluates the derivative function F for the particular problem as in Eq. ( 1 ) using the input time t , vector of dependent variables y , and constant parameter ( s ) g . The device function rkcStep , not given here , takes a single integration step using Eqs . ( 2 ) – ( 9 ) , returning the vector of integrated values yTemp as well as the error vector yErr . A number of constants were used in this function , given here : 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 # define UROUND ( 2 . 22 e -16 ) # define SAFETY 0.9 # define PGROW ( - 0 . 2 ) # define PSHRNK ( - 0 . 25 ) # define ERRCON ( 1 . 89 e -4 ) # define TINY ( 1 . 0 e -30 ) const double eps = 1.0 e -10 ; 3.2 RKC Code The RKC driver algorithm is next given . For this algorithm , the number of stages must be determined at each step to handle local stiffness ; to avoid excess computation , a maximum number of stages is first set . In addition , minimum and maximum allowable time step sizes are defined . 1 2 3 4 __device__ void rkcDriver ( double t , const double tEnd , const double g , double * y ) { // number of steps int numStep = 0 ; 5 6 7 // maximum allowable number of RKC stages int mMax = ( int ) ( round ( sqrt ( relTol / ( 10 . 0 * UROUND )))) ; 8 9 10 // RKC needs at least two stages for second - order accuracy if ( mMax < 2 ) mMax = 2 ; 9 11 12 13 // maximum allowable step size const double stepSizeMax = fabs ( tEnd - t ) ; 14 15 16 // minimum allowable step size double stepSizeMin = 10.0 * UROUND * fmax ( fabs ( t ) , stepSizeMax ) ; Then , the algorithm evaluates the derivative using the initial conditions for use as the initial eigenvector estimate for the spectral radius calculation . The calculated eigenvectors are stored and used as initial guesses in later steps . 1 2 3 4 // internal y vector double y_n [ NEQN ] ; for ( int i = 0 ; i < NEQN ; ++ i ) y_n [ i ] = y [ i ] ; 5 6 7 8 // calculate F_n for initial y double F_n [ NEQN ] ; dydt ( t , y_n , g , F_n ) ; 9 10 11 // internal work vector double work [ 4 + NEQN ] ; 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 // load initial estimate for eigenvector if ( work [ 2 ] < UROUND ) { for ( int i = 0 ; i < NEQN ; ++ i ) { work [ 4 + i ] = F_n [ i ] ; } } Inside the time integration loop , the algorithm calculates the spectral radius for the first step – which it next uses to determine the initial step size – and every 25 steps thereafter . 1 2 3 // perform internal sub - stepping while ( t < tEnd ) { double tempArr [ NEQN ] , tempArr2 [ NEQN ] , err ; 4 5 6 // if last step , limit step size if (( 1 . 1 * work [ 2 ] ) > = fabs ( tEnd - t )) work [ 2 ] = fabs ( tEnd - t ) ; 7 8 9 10 11 // estimate Jacobian spectral radius if 25 steps passed if (( numStep % 25 ) == 0 ) { work [ 3 ] = rkcSpecRad ( t , y_n , g , F_n , stepSizeMax , & work [ 4 ] , tempArr2 ) ; } For the initial step , a trial step is taken using the inverse of the spectral radius as the step size ; the resulting error is used to determine an appropriate step size that satisfies error control . 1 2 3 4 // if this is initial step if ( work [ 2 ] < UROUND ) { // estimate first time step work [ 2 ] = stepSizeMax ; 5 6 7 if (( work [ 3 ] * work [ 2 ] ) > 1.0 ) work [ 2 ] = 1.0 / work [ 3 ] ; work [ 2 ] = fmax ( work [ 2 ] , stepSizeMin ) ; 8 9 10 11 12 for ( int i = 0 ; i < NEQN ; ++ i ) { temp_arr [ i ] = y_n [ i ] + ( work [ 2 ] * F_n [ i ] ) ; } dydt ( t + work [ 2 ] , tempArr , g , tempArr2 ) ; 10 13 err = 0.0 ; for ( int i = 0 ; i < NEQN ; ++ i ) { double est = ( tempArr2 [ i ] - F_n [ i ] ) / ( absTol + relTol * fabs ( y_n [ i ] )) ; err + = est * est ; } err = work [ 2 ] * sqrt ( err / NEQN ) ; 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 if (( P1 * work [ 2 ] ) < ( stepSizeMax * sqrt ( err ))) { work [ 2 ] = fmax ( P1 * work [ 2 ] / sqrt ( err ) , stepSizeMin ) ; } else { work [ 2 ] = stepSizeMax ; } 21 22 23 24 25 26 } For all steps following the first , the value stored in work [ 2 ] is used for the time step size . Next , the number of stages is determined using the spectral radius and current time step size , and a tentative integration step performed . 1 2 // calculate number of steps int m = 1 + ( int ) ( sqrt ( 1 . 54 * work [ 2 ] * work [ 3 ] + 1.0 )) ; 3 4 5 6 7 8 // modify step size based on stages if ( m > mMax ) { m = mMax ; work [ 2 ] = (( double ) ( m * m - 1 ) ) / ( 1 . 54 * work [ 3 ] ) ; } 9 10 11 // perform tentative time step rkcStep ( t , y_n , g , F_n , work [ 2 ] , m , y ) ; The algorithm then estimates the error of that step . 1 2 // calculate derivative F_np1 with tentative y_np1 dydt ( t + work [ 2 ] , y , g , tempArr ) ; 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 // estimate error err = 0.0 ; for ( int i = 0 ; i < NEQN ; ++ i ) { double est = 0.8 * ( y_n [ i ] - y [ i ] ) + 0.4 * work [ 2 ] * ( F_n [ i ] + tempArr [ i ] ) ; est / = ( absTol + relTol * fmax ( fabs ( y [ i ] ) , fabs ( y_n [ i ] ))) ; err + = est * est ; } err = sqrt ( err / (( double ) N )) ; Based on the error magnitude , the algorithm determines whether to accept the step and proceed to the next step or decrease the step size and repeat the current step . 1 2 3 4 5 // check value of error if ( err > 1.0 ) { // error too large , step is rejected // select smaller step size work [ 2 ] = 0.8 * work [ 2 ] / ( pow ( err , ( 1 . 0 / 3.0 ))) ; 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 // reevaluate spectral radius work [ 3 ] = rkcSpecRad ( t , y_n , g , F_n , stepSizeMax , & work [ 4 ] , tempArr2 ) ; } else { // step accepted t + = work [ 2 ] ; numStep ++ ; 11 Finally , for an accepted step , the current step size and error are stored and the next step size is calculated . double fac = 10.0 ; double temp1 , temp2 ; 1 2 3 if ( work [ 1 ] < UROUND ) { temp2 = pow ( err , ( 1 . 0 / 3.0 )) ; if ( 0 . 8 < ( fac * temp2 )) fac = 0.8 / temp2 ; } else { temp1 = 0.8 * work [ 2 ] * pow ( work [ 0 ] , ( 1 . 0 / 3.0 )) ; temp2 = work [ 1 ] * pow ( err , ( 2 . 0 / 3.0 )) ; if ( temp1 < ( fac * temp2 )) fac = temp1 / temp2 ; } 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 // set "" old "" values to those for current time step work [ 0 ] = err ; work [ 1 ] = work [ 2 ] ; 13 14 15 16 for ( int i = 0 ; i < NEQN ; ++ i ) { y_n [ i ] = y [ i ] ; F_n [ i ] = tempArr [ i ] ; } 17 18 19 20 21 work [ 2 ] * = fmax ( P1 , fac ) ; work [ 2 ] = fmax ( stepSizeMin , fmin ( stepSizeMax , work [ 2 ] )) ; 22 23 } 24 } 25 26 } As before , we do not provide the RKC integration step device function rkcStep , which evaluates Eqs . ( 13 ) – ( 16 ) . The absolute and relative tolerances absTol and relTol are set as defined constants , e.g. , : 1 2 const double abs_tol = 1.0 e -10 ; const double rel_tol = 1.0 e -6 ; Note that these may be modified to more stringent tolerances if desired . The constant UROUND is defined the same as in the RKCK code above . The local work array work contains , in element order : 0 the previous step error estimation , 1 previous time step , 2 current time step , 3 spectral radius , and 4 vector of eigenvalues ( of size N ) . The device function rkcSpecRad returns the spectral radius , the largest magnitude eigenvalue ; various methods may be used for this purpose depending on the case . We provide GPU source code for a nonlinear power method adopted from Sommeijer et al. [ 31 ] that may be used for general applications in the Appendix . 12 4 Performance Results We tested the performance of the GPU-based RKCK and RKC integration algorithms using two ODE test cases , ranging the number of ODE systems from 101 to 105 . For both cases , all calculations were performed in double precision using a single GPU and single CPU ; we compared the performance of the GPU algorithm against serial CPU calculations as well as parallelized CPU performance – via OpenMP [ 35 ] – on four cores . We performed the GPU calculations using an NVIDIA Tesla c2075 GPU with 6 GB of global memory , and an Intel Xeon X5650 CPU , running at 2.67 GHz with 256 kB of L2 cache memory per core and 12 MB of L3 cache memory , served as the host processor both for the GPU calculations and the CPU single - and four-core OpenMP calculations . We used the GNU Compiler Collection ( gcc ) version 4.6.2 ( with the compiler options "" - O3 - ffast-math - std = c99 - m64 "" ) to compile the CPU programs and the CUDA 5.5 compiler nvcc version 5.5.0 ( "" - O3 - arch = sm_20 - m64 "" ) to compile the GPU versions . We set the GPU to persistence mode , but also used the cudaSetDevice ( ) to hide any further device initialization delay in the CUDA implementations prior to the timing . The integration algorithms take as input initial conditions and a global time step , performing internal sub-stepping as necessary . The computational wall-clock times reported represent the average over ten global time steps , which for the GPU versions includes the overhead required for transmitting data between the CPU and GPU before and after each global step . The integrator restarts at each global time step , not storing any data from the previous step – although any substepping performed by the algorithm within these larger steps does benefit from retained information from prior sub-steps . Interested readers should refer to Niemeyer and Sung [ 22 ] for more detailed performance evaluations of these algorithms in the context of chemical kinetics problems . 4.1 RKCK Results We used the Pleiades ODE test problem ( PLEI ) of Hairer et al. [ 23 , 36 ] to test the GPU - and CPU-based versions of the RKCK integrator . This nonstiff test case originates from a celestial mechanisms problem tracking the coordinates of seven stars ; it consists of a set of 14 second-order ODEs based on Newtonian gravitational forces , in the form ~ x ~ z00 = ~ y ! 00 ( 1 ) x00i = fi f ~ ( 1 ) ( ~ x , ~ y ) , f ~ ( 2 ) ( ~ x , ~ y ) ! = ( ~ x , ~ y ) = X ~ z ∈ < 14 , ( 34 ) mj ( xj − xi ) / rij , ( 35 ) mj ( yj − yi ) / rij , ( 36 ) 3 / 2 ( 37 ) j6 = i yi00 = ( 2 ) fi ( ~ x , ~ y ) = X j6 = i rij = ( xi − xj ) 2 + ( yi − yj ) , i , j = 1 , ... , 7 , where ( xi , yi ) and mi = i are the coordinates and mass of the ith star , respectively . This secondorder system can be converted into a system of 28 first-order ODEs of the form by defining w ~ = ~ z0 , such that ! 0 !! ~ z w ~ ~ z = ~ , ∈ < 28 . ( 38 ) w ~ f ( ~ z ) w ~ While the original problem offers specific initial conditions for a single ODE system , here we consider a large number of ODEs with the initial conditions randomly perturbed by a small factor to 13 4 Speedup factor of RKCK-GPU 3.5 3 2.5 2 1.5 1 0.5 0 103 RKCK-GPU vs. RKCK-CPU RKCK-GPU vs. RKCK-CPU × 4 104 105 Number of independent ODE systems Figure 1 : Speedup factors offered by GPU-based explicit RKCK integration algorithm over singleand four-core CPU-based versions for Pleiades ODE problem . Note that the horizontal axis is displayed in logarithmic scale . 14 emulate a sensitivity analysis . We integrated the ODE systems from t = 0 s to 1.0 s using 1.0 × 10 − 1 s as the global time step size . We set the RKCK tolerance ε ( eps in the code ) to 1.0 × 10 − 10 . Figure 1 shows the speedup factors , measured as the ratio of computational times per step , offered by the GPU-based RKCK algorithm over the baseline CPU version for both serial and four-core parallel operation , for numbers of ODE systems ranging from 1024 to 262,144 . The GPU-based algorithm ran faster than the serial and parallel CPU-based algorithms for Node larger than 4096 and 8192 , respectively . For the current problem , at best the GPU offered a speedup factors of nearly four and two over the serial and four-core CPU implementations , respectively . The non-smooth performance scaling resulted from the randomly perturbed initial conditions . Note that since each ODE system used randomly perturbed initial conditions , adjacent threads in the GPU implementation handled potentially extremely different initial condition values , resulting in thread divergence due to varying internal time step sizes . Therefore , the results shown here represent a worst-case GPU algorithm performance , particularly compared to applications involving operator-split reactive-flow codes where adjacent threads / ODE systems correspond to neighboring spatial locations . In such situations , initial conditions would be more similar and therefore follow similar instruction pathways . In either case , GPU-based integration algorithms offer performance benefits over the baseline CPU versions . See Niemeyer and Sung [ 22 ] for more discussion on this topic . Furthermore , the current problem involved a relatively simple system of ODEs , limiting the calculations performed on the GPU between the memory transfers before and after each integration step . ODE systems with more complex derivative functions would saturate the GPU with operations , increasing performance . For example , the RKCK algorithm demonstrated by Niemeyer and Sung [ 22 ] performed up to 126 times faster on a GPU than on a serial CPU , integrating a chemical kinetics ODE system with nine species participating in 38 reaction steps – requiring significantly more floating-point calculations than the case studied here . 4.2 RKC Results To demonstrate the performance of the GPU-based RKC algorithm , we used a chemical kinetics problem : the ODE system describing the constant-volume autoignition of ethanol ( C2 H5 OH ) . We implemented the reaction mechanism of Marinov [ 37 ] to describe the oxidation of ethanol , with 57 species participating in 766 irreversible reaction steps . The governing ODE system contained 58 ~ : equations : one for temperature T and the rest for species mass fractions Y d ~ y = dt dYNsp dT dY1 ,, ... , dt dt dt | , ( 39 ) Nsp dT 1 X = − ei ωi Wi , dt ρcv i = 1 dYi Wi ωi = , i = 1 , ... , Nsp , dt ρ ωi = NX reac Nsp 00 νij − 0 νij j = 1 kj Y ν0 Ck kj , ( 40 ) ( 41 ) ( 42 ) k = 1 where ρ indicates the density , cv the mass-averaged constant-volume specific heat , ei the internal 00 and ν 0 the forward and energy of the ith species , Wi the molecular weight of the ith species , νij ij reverse stoichiometric coefficients for the ith species in reaction j , Ck the molar concentration of the kth species , and Nsp and Nreac are the numbers of species and reactions , respectively .

Note that both axes are displayed in logarithmic scale . reaction j without pressure dependence , the rate coefficient kj is given in Arrhenius form by kj = Aj T βj − Ej exp RT , ( 43 ) where R is the universal gas constant , Aj the pre-exponential coefficient , βj the temperature exponent , and Ej the activation energy . Note that reactions can be pressure-dependent ( see , e.g. , Law [ 38 ] for examples of various pressure-dependence formulations ) ; these were also considered in the current implementation . This problem is moderately stiff using a time step size of δt = 1.0 × 10 − 6 s for 10 global time steps . In this case , we generated initial conditions for the set of ODE systems by sampling the solutions obtained from constant-pressure homogeneous ignition simulations , initiated at 1600 K , 1 atm , and an equivalence ratio of one1 . We assigned these initial conditions sequentially , such that adjacent threads in the GPU implementation contained data from consecutive time steps in the sample – and therefore such threads handled the integration of similar conditions , emulating adjacent spatial locations in an operator-split reactive-flow simulation . Figure 2 shows the speedup factors offered by the GPU-based RKC algorithm over the baseline CPU version for both serial and four-core parallel operation , for numbers of ODE systems ranging from 64 to 16,384 . In this case , the GPU-accelerated code ran faster than the serial CPU version for the entire range of ODE system sizes considered , while it offered better performance than the four-core parallel CPU version for 256 ODEs and higher . At best , the GPU-based RKC algorithm 1 An equivalence ratio of one indicates the mixture of fuel and oxidizer set to an appropriate ratio for complete combustion . 16 ran nearly 64 and 17 times faster than the serial and four-core CPU implementations , respectively . The discontinuity in speedup seen in Fig. 2 corresponded to the inclusion of conditions leading to greater stiffness . 5 Conclusions In this chapter , we presented two explicit algorithms appropriate for integrating large numbers of independent ODE systems on GPUs . Specifically , we proposed the fifth-order adaptive Runge – Kutta – Cash – Karp ( RKCK ) method for nonstiff problems and the stabilized second-order adaptive Runge – Kutta – Chebyshev ( RKC ) method for problems with moderate levels of stiffness . Source code and implementation details were presented to ease the adoption of such methods , and performance comparison results were presented for each method . The examples shown here served to demonstrate the potential of GPU acceleration where many independent systems of ODEs need to be integrated ; in the case of the RKC algorithm , we demonstrated more than an order of magnitude performance increase over an equivalent parallel CPU code running on four cores . The types of scientific and engineering problems dealing with large numbers of ODEs – in particular , reactive-flow models that rely on operator splitting – can benefit significantly from GPU acceleration ; interested readers can directly implement the algorithms presented here to such ends , or use them as the beginnings for their own solution .

1671,A16,"World War I , also called First World War or Great War , an international conflict that in 1914 – 18 embroiled most of the nations of Europe along with Russia , the United States , the Middle East , and other regions . The war pitted the Central Powers – mainly Germany , Austria-Hungary , and Turkey – against the Allies – mainly France , Great Britain , Russia , Italy , Japan , and , from 1917 , the United States . It ended with the defeat of the Central Powers . The war was virtually unprecedented in the slaughter , carnage , and destruction it caused . A British soldier inside a trench on the Western Front during World War I , 1914 – 18 . Hulton Archive / Getty Images World War I was one of the great watersheds of 20th-century geopolitical history . It led to the fall of four great imperial dynasties ( in Germany , Russia , Austria-Hungary , and Turkey ) , resulted in the Bolshevik Revolution in Russia , and , in its destabilization of European society , laid the groundwork for World War II . A collection of significant facts about World War I. The outbreak of war With Serbia already much aggrandized by the two Balkan Wars ( 1912 – 13 , 1913 ) , Serbian nationalists turned their attention back to the idea of "" liberating "" the South Slavs of Austria-Hungary . Colonel Dragutin Dimitrijević , head of Serbia's military intelligence , was also , under the alias "" Apis , "" head of the secret society Union or Death , pledged to the pursuit of this pan-Serbian ambition . Believing that the Serbs' cause would be served by the death of the Austrian archduke Franz Ferdinand , heir presumptive to the Austrian emperor Franz Joseph , and learning that the Archduke was about to visit Bosnia on a tour of military inspection , Apis plotted his assassination . Nikola Pašić , the Serbian prime minister and an enemy of Apis , heard of the plot and warned the Austrian government of it , but his message was too cautiously worded to be understood . Overview of the start of World War I , including details of the June 28 , 1914 , assassination of ... Europeans were fighting heavily on two fronts before the U.S. entered the war in 1917 . At 11 : 15 am on June 28 , 1914 , in the Bosnian capital , Sarajevo , Franz Ferdinand and his morganatic wife , Sophie , duchess of Hohenberg , were shot dead by a Bosnian Serb , Gavrilo Princip . The chief of the Austro-Hungarian general staff , Franz , Graf ( count ) Conrad von Hötzendorf , and the foreign minister , Leopold , Graf von Berchtold , saw the crime as the occasion for measures to humiliate Serbia and so to enhance Austria-Hungary's prestige in the Balkans . Conrad had already ( October 1913 ) been assured by William II of Germany ' s support if Austria-Hungary should start a preventive war against Serbia . This assurance was confirmed in the week following the assassination , before William , on July 6 , set off upon his annual cruise to the North Cape , off Norway . Austrian archduke Franz Ferdinand and his wife , Sophie , riding in an open carriage at Sarajevo ... Henry Guttmann – Hulton Archive / Getty Images The Austrians decided to present an unacceptable ultimatum to Serbia and then to declare war , relying on Germany to deter Russia from intervention . Though the terms of the ultimatum were finally approved on July 19 , its delivery was postponed to the evening of July 23 , since by that time the French president , Raymond Poincaré , and his premier , René Viviani , who had set off on a state visit to Russia on July 15 , would be on their way home and therefore unable to concert an immediate reaction with their Russian allies . When the delivery was announced , on July 24 , Russia declared that Austria-Hungary must not be allowed to crush Serbia . Serbia replied to the ultimatum on July 25 , accepting most of its demands but protesting against two of them – namely , that Serbian officials ( unnamed ) should be dismissed at Austria-Hungary's behest and that Austro-Hungarian officials should take part , on Serbian soil , in proceedings against organizations hostile to Austria-Hungary . Though Serbia offered to submit the issue to international arbitration , Austria-Hungary promptly severed diplomatic relations and ordered partial mobilization . Home from his cruise on July 27 , William learned on July 28 how Serbia had replied to the ultimatum . At once he instructed the German Foreign Office to tell Austria-Hungary that there was no longer any justification for war and that it should content itself with a temporary occupation of Belgrade . But , meanwhile , the German Foreign Office had been giving such encouragement to Berchtold that already on July 27 he had persuaded Franz Joseph to authorize war against Serbia . War was in fact declared on July 28 , and Austro-Hungarian artillery began to bombard Belgrade the next day . Russia then ordered partial mobilization against Austria-Hungary , and on July 30 , when Austria-Hungary was riposting conventionally with an order of mobilization on its Russian frontier , Russia ordered general mobilization . Germany , which since July 28 had still been hoping , in disregard of earlier warning hints from Great Britain , that Austria-Hungary's war against Serbia could be "" localized "" to the Balkans , was now disillusioned insofar as eastern Europe was concerned . On July 31 Germany sent a 24-hour ultimatum requiring Russia to halt its mobilization and an 18-hour ultimatum requiring France to promise neutrality in the event of war between Russia and Germany . Both Russia and France predictably ignored these demands . On August 1 Germany ordered general mobilization and declared war against Russia , and France likewise ordered general mobilization . The next day Germany sent troops into Luxembourg and demanded from Belgium free passage for German troops across its neutral territory . On August 3 Germany declared war against France . In the night of August 3 – 4 German forces invaded Belgium . Thereupon , Great Britain , which had no concern with Serbia and no express obligation to fight either for Russia or for France but was expressly committed to defend Belgium , on August 4 declared war against Germany . Austria-Hungary declared war against Russia on August 5 ; Serbia against Germany on August 6 ; Montenegro against Austria-Hungary on August 7 and against Germany on August 12 ; France and Great Britain against Austria-Hungary on August 10 and on August 12 , respectively ; Japan against Germany on August 23 ; Austria-Hungary against Japan on August 25 and against Belgium on August 28 . Romania had renewed its secret anti-Russian alliance of 1883 with the Central Powers on February 26 , 1914 , but now chose to remain neutral . Italy had confirmed the Triple Alliance on December 7 , 1912 , but could now propound formal arguments for disregarding it : first , Italy was not obliged to support its allies in a war of aggression ; second , the original treaty of 1882 had stated expressly that the alliance was not against England . On September 5 , 1914 , Russia , France , and Great Britain concluded the Treaty of London , each promising not to make a separate peace with the Central Powers . Thenceforth , they could be called the Allied , or Entente , powers , or simply the Allies . The outbreak of war in August 1914 was generally greeted with confidence and jubilation by the peoples of Europe , among whom it inspired a wave of patriotic feeling and celebration . Few people imagined how long or how disastrous a war between the great nations of Europe could be , and most believed that their country's side would be victorious within a matter of months . The war was welcomed either patriotically , as a defensive one imposed by national necessity , or idealistically , as one for upholding right against might , the sanctity of treaties , and international morality . Britannica Web sites World War I lasted from 1914 to 1918 . It was known at first as the Great War and the War to End All Wars . It was the largest war that the world had seen up to that time . Most of the battles took place in Europe and the Middle East . More than 8 million soldiers and sailors died , and more than 20 million were injured . The war was so bad that many people thought no one would ever start another war . However , the results of World War I helped to cause World War II , which broke out in 1939 . A major international conflict fought from 1914 to 1918 , World War I was the most deadly and destructive war the world had ever seen to that time . More than 25 countries eventually participated , aligned with either the Allied or the Central powers . The Allies-who won the war-included primarily France , Great Britain , Russia , Italy , Japan , and , from 1917 , the United States . The Central Powers consisted mainly of Germany , Austria-Hungary , and the Ottoman Empire ( Turkey ) . World War I felled four great imperial dynasties , in Germany , Russia , Austria-Hungary , and Turkey . It led to revolution in Russia , destabilized Europe , and laid the foundations for World War II . ( For a chronology of events for World War I , see World War I Chronology . ) </doc>

1157,A1,"Drug abuse has always been a very delicate question as it always it deals with the health , well-being and even lives of human beings belonging to any country . The position of the United States of America towards drugs has always been very clear and distinctively negative . Throughout the history of the country there were numerous cases against drug dealers , buyers and many more . These cases did always catch the attention of civil people who by showing interest in such cases revealed their worries about the future of their own children that one-day might face this problem , too . As time goes by it get even more clear that people need to feel protection from the side of law-enforcement establishments such as police . Drugs may destroy the life of a person , therefore while fighting with drug dealers and buyers cooperatives no other interest rather than removing this "" elements "" from the society should be taken into account . The case , which is known as "" United States v. Oakland Cannabis Buyers' Cooperative "" did more than just catch the attention of people . Million of people followed the case from its very beginning and did have certain expectations concerning the outcome of the case . The specifics of the case made people have twofold points of view when analyzing the solution that was delivered by Justice Clarence Thomas concerning the case . Nevertheless , to understand the solution it is necessary to examine the case deeper and only then decide whether the Court's decision is really twofold , ambiguous or completely justified . 2 . Main points of the case . Summarizing the main point in the opinion of the case it is necessary to start from its very beginning . The case was argued on the 28th of March 2001 and the decision was delivered on the 14th of May 2001 . It was argued intensively and both of the sides were acted rather confident . The Oakland Cannabis Buyers' Cooperative with Jeffrey Jones as a head started its life according to California's Compassionate Use Act of 1996 and was started to follow medical purposes of distributing marijuana to people that in accordance with their state of health qualify for it as a treatment . This organization spent two years distributing marijuana to "" qualified patients "" until the year of 1998 , when it was sued by USA . The main point of the argument was that USA's government charge of Oakland Cannabis Buyers' Cooperative breach of the Controlled Substances Act's and mainly its "" embargo "" for distributing , manufacturing , and possessing of the substance , as far as marijuana is listed in the Controlled Substances Act . The activity of the Cooperative continued in spite of the District's Court decision and its activity was very intense . The key issue presented by the Cooperative was its medical necessity defense , other words they stated that all the marijuana that was distributed by means of their organization was only distributed according to the medical necessity of this substance by qualified patients . As it has been already mentioned the District Court made an injunction concerning the activity of the organization and the following consideration of the case lead to the Court of Appeal . According to the Court of Appeal all the "" medically necessary distributions were to be permitted "" . So the reason the United Stated of America charged the organization is for the violation of the policy concerning the distribution and manufacturing of the substance . On the other side the Oakland Cannabis Buyers' Cooperative cited the medical necessity defense which was approved the Court of Appeal and lately made the District Court change its injunction concerning the activity of the cooperative . 2a . The main argument of USA suing the Cooperative . The United States of America on its side presented a tremendously weighty argument that deals with the law of the country in the first place . The mentioned above Controlled Substances Act is a certain prohibition concerning narcotics , which has been made by experts and considered to be a law . Ordinarily , there is no exception from the law that already exists ; it is similar to the situation when the fact of not knowing a certain law does not release from the responsibility for its violation . The argument of the case was related to the possibility to make an exception concerning the Controlled Substances Act prohibitions . Oakland Cannabis Buyers' Cooperative implied that marijuana is medically necessary for a definite group of people and the USA's government considered this to be a violation the Controlled Substances Act . The "" degree "" of marijuana's necessity in medical purposes was point that caused the majority of the questions throughout the case . The Court was supposed to "" solve the problem "" and announce its verdict . 3 . The Court's decision . "" The statute reflects a determination that marijuana has no medical benefits worthy of an exception ; medical necessity is not a defense to manufacturing and distributing marijuana , "" – these words of Justice Clarence Thomas clearly reveal the decision of the Court . The "" degree "" of medical necessity of marijuana was decided not to be enough to make an exception in the Controlled Substances Act and therefore sell it to people , who may medically require it . Manufacturing of marijuana as a fact in the activity of the Oakland Cannabis Buyers ' Cooperative and therefore its possibility to distribute marijuana to the citizens of the country was concluded to be weightier than marijuana's medical treatment characteristics . Therefore the Court confirmed USA's position of the impossibility to make violate the prohibitions of the Controlled Substances Act . The opinion of the Court basically reflected the next – no distribution should be justified even by medical necessity and no defense should be given to such distributors . The possibility to make an exception was reviewed in four medical cases : "" The foregoing injunction does not apply to the distribution of cannabis by the Oakland Cannabis Buyers' Cooperative and Jeffrey Jones to patient-members who ( 1 ) suffer from a serious medical condition , ( 2 ) will suffer imminent harm if the patient-member does not have access to cannabis , ( 3 ) need cannabis for the treatment of the patient-member's medical condition , or need cannabis to alleviate the medical condition or symptoms associated with the medical condition , and ( 4 ) have no reasonable legal alternative to cannabis for the effective treatment or alleviation of the patient-member's medical condition or symptoms associated with the medical condition because the patient-member has tried all other legal alternatives to cannabis and the alternatives have been ineffective in treating or alleviating the patient-member's medical condition or symptoms associated with the medical condition , or the alternatives result in side effects which the patient-member can not reasonably tolerate . "" This "" critical exception "" by itself caused a lot of arguments and undermined the steadfastness of the Controlled Substances Act . Nevertheless , the decision of the case remained unflinching and by this produced a lot of opposition . 4 . Various aspects of the case . The decision of the court is obviously twofold and makes every person think deeply before expression any kind of opinions . People who really do suffer from hard diseases and may require marijuana might experience certain difficulties and probable complications in their health state . Therefore hospitals , which previously primarily had to deal with people belonging to this group , find themselves in the situation of inability to help their patients . They need to find more high-priced medicaments for the patient's treatment , which may hit hard the budget of the hospital and of the patient . This definite case is very complicated due to its connection to the most valuable thing – the life and health of a human being . This ambiguous case may require new statutes or constitutional amendments , due to the statutory ambiguity according to the opinion of some people . Nevertheless , this ambiguity is rather questionable and the Controlled Substances Act points it rather clearly . It seems that it is better to find a medical substitute of marijuana , which is easier to do nowadays when medicine keeps providing new innovative medicaments , than it was for instance , 30 years ago . And maybe this is one of the primary reasons the Controlled Substance Act becomes so restrictive . It is obvious that it was designed in order to protect the health of the citizens of the country from drug-dependence and therefore any statement claiming that it will kill people has no base under itself . It was a case of health v. health , and the only difference was that the Controlled Substance Act protected million of potential dope fiends and the cooperative defended a certain group of people who may find an alternative medical treatment . So , the Court's decision remains the same : "" ... there is no medical necessity exception to the prohibitions at issue , even when the patient is "" seriously ill "" and lacks alternative avenues for relief "" . Conclusion . Is marijuana that advisable after all ? This was the main question that the Court answered by its decision . It is obvious that this case did touch certain moral issues , as the case was about the health of human beings . Analyzing the destructive influence of marijuana in general it is necessary to remember that marijuana does more harm than it does good . Therefore , would not it be the main question to stop the outcry against the policy . A narcotic will always remain a narcotic ; even the famous genius Sigmund Fried went through this trying to treat people . Why should we do it ? Let us put the health of the nation ahead of everything . </doc>

137,A14,"H-Darrieus Wind Turbine with Blade Pitch Control Abstract A procedure for computing the optimal variation of the blades' pitch angle of an H-Darrieus wind turbine that maximizes its torque at given operational conditions is proposed and presented along with the results obtained on a 7 kW prototype . The CARDAAV code , based on the "" Double-Multiple Streamtube "" model developed by the first author , is used to determine the performances of the straight-bladed vertical axis wind turbine . This was coupled with a genetic algorithm optimizer . The azimuthal variation of the blades' pitch angle is modeled with an analytical function whose coefficients are used as variables in the optimization process . Two types of variations were considered for the pitch angle : a simple sinusoidal one and one which is more general , relating closely the blades' pitch to the local flow conditions along their circular path . A gain of almost 30 % in the annual energy production was obtained with the polynomial optimal pitch control . 1 . Introduction Following the 1973 energy crisis , large-scale research and development programs were initiated , directed toward finding replacement solutions to the limited fossil fuel reserves . Wind energy was given , along with photovoltaic , solar , hydroelectric , biomass , and other resources , particular attention as a renewable and environmentally friendly energy alternative . Its technological progress has been spectacular , especially in the last ten years and , due to its steady growth in competitiveness , wind power developed into a mainstream energy source in many countries worldwide . At the global scale , over 74000 MW of wind power are already installed , and current estimates indicate that by 2030 wind energy could cover as much as 29 % of world's electricity needs . In the wind power domain two main technologies were considered as having the necessary potential for a viable development : the Horizontal Axis Wind Turbine ( HAWT ) and the Darrieus-type ( lift-based ) Vertical Axis Wind Turbine ( VAWT ) . A number of features have made HAWT to be preferred and become the dominant design type , especially in the utility-scale ( large and very large turbines ) segment . But , in certain conditions ( sites with highly turbulent wind like in the mountains or in urban environment ) , VAWTs seem to offer a better solution for the wind energy harnessing . If , through further and well-targeted research , increased attention is paid to the known VAWT drawbacks ( a somewhat less overall efficiency than the one of an HAWT , difficult / impossible self-starting , lower output due to operation closer to the ground , higher level of vibration caused by the inherent torque ripple and dynamic stall of the blades ) , at least in the "" small wind "" domain the VAWT design might become a major player . Among the most important problems that are now under study in the VAWT technology , the "" variable pitch "" for the H-Darrieus turbines is regarded as a promising solution for the alleviation of the negative effects of the blades dynamic stall ( efficiency loss , vibration ) , improvement of the rotor's self starting qualities , and torque ripple smoothing [ 1 – 3 ] . At École Polytechnique de Montreal , Canada , in the wind energy research the major effort is devoted toward the development and improvement of the performance prediction of VAWTs [ 4 ] . The variable pitch is also included in the current research subjects in this domain , and results were already published [ 8 ] , obtained from the analysis that was carried out to determine if the performance of a VAWT , in terms of the power output , could be improved by simulating the operation of the blade just below stall . The present study aimed at determining if a more general cyclical pitch variation can be determined , so as to maximize the performance of an H-Darrieus ( straight bladed ) vertical axis wind turbine at given operation conditions . In order to perform this investigation , an optimization package was set up to serve in the determination of the optimal variation of the blade's pitch angle for a small two-bladed VAWT . The paper presents first the main components of the numerical tool that was developed . Then , the results of an optimization case are discussed . Finally , several conclusions are formulated at the end of the paper . 2 . The Optmization Tool Since the local flow parameters on the blades vary along their circular path and differ quite significantly between the upwind and the downwind parts of the rotor , an optimization procedure had to be employed to determine the best law of variation of the blades' pitch angle . In the present study a tool for numerical optimization was set up by coupling the code CARDAAV , which computes the flow through and the performances of a VAWT , to an optimizer based on the genetic algorithm method . These ( main ) components of the optimization package are briefly presented in the following sections , along with the objective function , its variables , and the constraints that were imposed on their value during the optimization process . 2.1 . The CARDAAV Code CARDAAV , the numerical tool used in this analysis , is based on an improved version of the "" double-multiple streamtube "" ( DMS ) model [ 4 ] . This model considers a partition of the rotor in streamtubes and treats each of the two blade elements defined by a given streamtube as an actuator disk . Figure 1 illustrates such a streamtube and shows the values of the velocity of the flow at a number of key stations along it . Disk 1 represents the upwind blade element while disk 2 represents the downwind blade element . The actuator disk theory is based on the momentum conservation ; therefore , the velocities of the wind must be known in order to compute the force acting on the disks . The different values of the velocity ( see notations in Figure 1 and relations ( 1 ) depend on the incoming ( "" undisturbed "" ) wind velocity and on the interference factors u and u ( 1 ) To determine the interference factors , a second set of equations is used . Those equations are derived from the blade element theory [ 4 ] , which equates , in each streamtube , the normal forces acting on the upwind and downwind blade elements to the forces acting upon the actuator disks . To compute the normal and tangential forces , the blade element theory is applied , and the lift ( C l ) and drag ( C d ) coefficients , obtained from the airfoil data , are used . For the upwind interference factor u , the following expression , relating it to the azimuthal angle θ , is obtained : u ( θ ) = K K ( 2 ) with K = 8 π r ( 3 ) A similar set of equations is derived for the downwind interference factor u ' . An interference factor equal to 1 is assumed at the beginning of the iterative process . Once the force given by the blade element theory equates the one given by the actuator disk theory , the convergence is achieved and the upwind and downwind velocities are obtained . Then the torque and the mechanical power are computed . CARDAAV has the capability to analyze several predefined or user-defined rotor shapes with straight or curved blades ( parabola , catenary , ideal and modified troposkien , and Sandia shape ) . The code requires three main sets of input data , giving the geometry definition of the wind turbine ( diameter , height , blade section airfoil , blade shape , etc. ) , the operational conditions ( wind velocity , rotational speed , atmospheric conditions ) and the main control parameters ( convergence criterion , computation of the secondary effects , and the effect of dynamic stall ) . The software includes several dynamic stall semiempirical models : Gormont [ 5 ] and its variations ( Strickland , Paraschivoiu , and Berg ) and the one based on the indicial method [ 4 ] . Dynamic stall results in increased peak aerodynamic torque and affects the structural fatigue of the Darrieus turbine . This effect significantly impacts the drive-train generator sizing and system reliability . The dynamic stall used in this study was the Berg version of the Gormont model , because it was found out to be the best correlated with the experimental studies carried out on similar rotor configurations as those used in the present investigation . CARDAAV is also able to account for the so-called "" secondary effects , "" such as those due to the rotating central tower , struts , and spoilers . CARDAAV has made it possible to design , analyze , and build more efficiently and at lower costs wind energy systems such as the Darrieus-type VAWT . The code is used to determine , at specified operational conditions , aero-dynamic forces and power output of VAWTs of any blade geometry . Wind speed can vary with height above ground according to a power law . The program output consists of the local-induced velocities , the local Reynolds numbers and angle of attack , the blade loads , and the azimuthal torque and power coefficient data . Each of these is calculated separately for the upwind and downwind halves of the rotor . The numerical models used by the program have been validated for different Darrieus-type VAWTs , through comparison with experimental data obtained from laboratory tests ( wind or water tunnels ) or from field tests , thus making CARDAAV a very attractive and efficient design and analysis tool . In Figure 2 the power output of the SANDIA 17 m wind turbine computed with CARDAAV is compared with experiments and results provided by other numerical codes . A M is an empirical constant used to correct C l and C d for dynamic stall effects [ 6 ] . 2.2 . The Optimizer To search for the best pitch variation law , an optimization strategy was adopted , namely , one that uses a genetic algorithm ( GA ) method . At the beginning of the optimization process , a genetic algorithm randomly selects an initial "" population "" composed of "" individuals "" , which are solutions of the analyzed problem computed for particular , randomly selected , values of the optimization variables . Three operations are typically performed by the genetic algorithms on the analyzed "" population "" : "" selection "" ( choice of the "" individuals "" for the next generation , according to a "" survival of the fittest "" criterion ) , "" crossover "" ( operation which allows information exchange between the "" individuals "" by swapping parts of the parameter vector in an attempt to get better "" individuals "" ) and "" mutation "" ( operation which introduces new or prematurely lost information in the form of random changes applied to randomly chosen vector components ) . Like in any optimization study , an "" objective function "" had to be defined . In this case the inverse of the rotor power , for given conditions of operation ( wind speed , rotational speed ) 1 F = P ( 4 ) was used as optimization function F. On the other hand , for the pitch angle the following analytical expression was considered : τ = x ( 5 ) For different values given to the optimization variables x , the variation of the blade pitch angle τ with the angle of azimuth θ will be different . Since the local angle of attack α of a blade element α = s i n ( 6 ) contains the pitch angle , the later influences the aerodynamic characteristics , the torque , and ultimately the power output of the rotor . Hence , through relations ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) an indirect link is established between the objective function ( 4 ) and the optimization variables x , which control the variation of τ . The genetic algorithm evolution strategy optimization package , GENIAL v1 . 1 [ 7 ] , was employed to minimize the objective function . This code includes three main modules , which perform the above mentioned operations . A number of parameters are available in each module to control its functioning during the optimum search process . As mentioned above , the coefficients x of the pitch variation function ( 5 ) were used as optimization variables . Their values were subjected to certain constraints , to avoid any possible mathematical invalidity and to keep the pitch angle within reasonable or practical ( technically feasible ) limits . 2.3 . The Optimization Package To set up the optimization package , including GENIAL and CARDAAV as principal components , a main program ( MAIN ) and a new subroutine ( PITCH ) had to be coded . When the program is launched , MAIN reads some of the parameters that control the optimization process , namely , those that are frequently changed ( size of the "" population "" – number of "" individuals "" , number of evaluations , constraints to be set on the optimization variables ) . These parameters have to be provided through the keyboard when a new optimization is initiated . Then , MAIN calls the optimizer ( GENIAL ) , which takes control and carries through the optimization process . For each combination of the optimization variables , defining a distinct ' individual "" , GENIAL calls ( using a "" system function "" ) PITCH then CARDAAV , which performs the analysis of the VAWT for that specific variation of the blades' pitch angle . With the turbine power , calculated by CARDAAV , the objective function ( 4 ) is determined and , based on it , the "" fitness function "" which characterizes that "" individual "" is obtained . Depending on its "" fitness "" , an "" individual "" can be maintained or eliminated from the "" population "" during the optimization process . Selection , crossover , and mutation are used to advance the "" population "" from one optimization cycle to the next until the optimum or the predefined limit of evolutions is reached . At the end of the optimization , MAIN outputs the optimal values of the x variables ( as found through optimization ) , which define the best variation law for the pitch angle . Corresponding to this , the performance characteristics of the turbine are computed and stored in a file for postprocessing purposes . As the name indicates , the subroutine PITCH uses relation ( 5 ) to calculate the pitch angle over the entire circular trajectory of the blades , based on the values of x received from GENIAL . It stores the azimuthal and the pitch angles in a file where CARDAAV seeks this information before performing each new analysis . 3 . Results This study was carried out on an H-Darrieus VAWT , having two constant-chord blades with an NACA 0015 airfoil cross section . It is a small , 7 kW rated power prototype , its rotor having the ( main ) geometrical characteristics given in Table 1 . The performance ( power , power coefficient , Figures 3 and 4 ) of this turbine was computed with CARDAAV in several situations : without taking into account the influence of the dynamic stall , by applying the dynamic stall correction , with a blade pitch that had a sinusoidal variation and with a blade pitch that varied according to relation ( 5 ) in which : x . These calculations , as well as all the other that are presented in this paper , have been performed for a constant rotational speed of 125 rpm and at one or several different wind speed values . </doc>

772,A14,"Title of Research Survival strategies of bone and cartilage cells Summary of Research Skeletal cells use specialised mechanisms to survive disease , overuse , drug side-effects and ageing hormonal systems . Skeletal health and repair depends on replenishment of ageing cells from precursor stem cells , efficient function of mature cells and adequate life span . Current treatments such as corticosteroids , HRT , bisphosphonates , statins and intermittent PTH affect skeletal cells to different degrees at all of these levels . While much is known about the molecular players that control survival and death in the immune system , brain and in cancer cells , the skeleton remains under studied . This prevents improvements in drug design and hampers development of new therapeutic technologies such as tissue engineering and use of bone marrow stem cells . Promotion of survival of healthy bone cartilage is essential for retaining mobility in an ageing population . This study seeks to provide fundamental understanding of the strategies used by skeletal cells to survive , so that we can harness this knowledge to produce more effective drugs . </doc>

What doing this path for you and I is the fact applying for limited-period online payday lenders one is the most safe than previously . If you 're seriously thinking of making online payday loan , Now i 'm let 's assume that you might have witout a doubt accomplished some study concerning the marketplace . If you happen to have n't much however , I want to explain quite a few for your requirements so you really do n't get rooked in the foreseeable future . There are some distinct things that you should especially bank personal loans for to ensure that the financial institution you 're going to borrow from is legit and respectable . To start , we certainly have the city Economic Assistance Association ( CFSA ) . This group is committed exclusively to shielding consumers of payday loan providers , and induces sensible regulation of the marketplace . That is the ONLY purpose of the CFSA . I highly recommend you usually look for their custom logo on any payday loanAndmoney improve providers you plan on using the services of . Next , usually locate a business that 's think qualified . Not surprisingly you will need to ensure that this company is qualified to work from the say that you liven in , yet it is also beneficial to find out how several declares a firm is qualified in as a whole . A service that does business in lots of declares , everything similar , one is the most believe in-worthwhile than a business that does business in not very many . Then 3rd , get them to be a member on the Bbb .

Last , make sure you confirm that the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) does n't have a conditions recorded from the business . When doing your homework if you ever notice of fraudulence conditions be sure to try to find a certain business or individuals label and check out that label . I realize of 1 illustration certainly where an swindle was being work which was making a legit business seem disreputable , but when you genuinely made involved with it you found out that this company was innocent and the crooks were n't attached to the business the slightest bit .

810,A16,"Seeing that the wind speed is always changing , it is easily to understand that the energy content of the wind is also always varying . But many factors influence these variations , like the weather , the obstacles or the local surface conditions . As experienced during hailstorms or thunderstorms when wind speed and direction both change very frequently because of gusts , turbulence can also be created in areas with a very uneven terrain surface or behind obstacles such as buildings or trees . Wind flows are very irregular , often in whirls in the neighbourhood . Turbulence decreases the possibility of using the energy in the wind effectively for a wind turbine . It also imposes more tear and wear on the wind turbines which is why towers for wind turbines are usually tall enough to avoid turbulence from the wind close to ground level . Diurnal ( night and day ) variations of the wind Generally , wind speeds are higher during the day than during the night . This phenomenon is mainly due to the temperature differences between the sea and the land surfaces generated by the solar activity . The wind is also more turbulent and tends to change direction more frequently during the day than at night . But electricity consumption being higher during the day , the fact that most of the wind energy is produced during daytime represents a great advantage . Seasonal Variations of the Wind As we can see on the graph , wind speeds vary during the year as the weather changes from summer to winter . As example , in temperate zones , winter winds are usually stronger than summer winds . But electricity consumption is also higher in winter than in summer . The use of wind turbine seems therefore particularly well adapted , seeing that wind electricity generally fits well into the electricity consumption pattern . Annual Variation in Wind Energy Wind patters may vary from year to year . But these variations are generally quite small . In the case of Denmark , the output from wind turbines typically varies of from 10 percent . This graph represents the variations of wind speeds with height in the roughness class 2 , assuming that the wind speed is 10m / s at a height of 100 meters . The fact that the wind speed decreases as we move closer to ground level is called wind shear . This phenomenon is crucial in the design of a wind turbine . Indeed , considering a wind turbine with a hub height of 40 meters and a rotor diameter of 40 meters , the previous graph shows that the wind blows at 9.3 m / s when the tip of the blade is in its uppermost position , whereas it blows at only 7.7 m / s when the tip is in the bottom position . Therefore , the forces acting on the rotor blade when it is in its top position are far larger than when it is in its bottom position . The wind speed at a certain height z above the ground is given by : where v is the reference speed , i.e. a wind speed we already know at height z . z is the roughness length in the current wind direction ( height above ground level where the wind speed is theoretically zero ) . z is the reference height , i.e. the height where we know the exact wind speed v ref. To give an example , assuming a roughness length of 0 . 1m a wind speed of 7.7 m / s at 20 m height , the wind speed at 60 m height will be : </doc>

1122,A17,"Roku vs. Apple TV vs. Chromecast vs. Amazon Fire TV vs. Android TV : Which streamer should you buy ? Fed up with your dumb "" smart TV ? "" Tired of waiting for your console to boot up just so you can watch Netflix ? Looking for a cheap tech gift ? There are plenty of reasons to get a new dedicated video streamer . We 'll help you choose one . Streaming video , whether it 's from Netflix , YouTube , Amazon Prime , Watch ESPN or PBS Kids , is more popular than ever . And the selection of devices to get those shows and movies from the Internet onto your TV continues to expand . In the last six months or so all of the major players in TV-based streaming -- Roku , Amazon , Google and Apple -- debuted brand-new gadgets . They also continue to sell older ones . The result is a cornucopia of choices overwhelming enough to give even the most gluttonous binge viewer indigestion . Related Stories I 've reviewed them all ( burp ) , and now I 'm here to thin-slice that deep-fried turducken and help you decide which streaming device is best for you . "" But wait a sec , Katzmaier , "" you say . "" I already have like 15 doohickeys that stream Netflix just fine . Why should I buy another ? "" If you 're happy with your current gear , then by all means stick with it . Game consoles like PlayStation and Xbox are still the most popular for streaming , but dedicated devices like Roku are gaining ground . Not every Netflix-capable device is created equal , and there are plenty of reasons to purchase a new one . Maybe you want the superior search , better app selection and constant updates that come with a dedicated streamer . Maybe you 're sick of waiting for your game console to fire up before you can visit "" The Ranch . "" Maybe you 've lost respect for your dumb "" smart TV . "" Maybe your old box is too slow or stuck with an old version of an app . Maybe you want your non-streaming , but otherwise perfectly hip grandma to finally understand your "" Kimmy Schmidt "" references . Editors' Note : This story was originally published earlier and has been fully updated to account for the release of the new Roku Streaming Stick . Blah , blah . Just shut up and tell me what to buy ! Roku's streamers offer the most TV apps , the easiest customization and the most comprehensive , price-conscious search , making them the best overall choice . And the new stick is the best value of the bunch , thanks to excellent performance and speed for the price , and just the features you need . If that 's enough , stop reading and reach for your wallet . It costs $ 50 . OK , smart guy , but what about all those others ? If you can watch it on your phone or tablet or computer , Chromecast can probably put it on your TV . The downside ? There 's no separate remote , so you 'll need your phone or tablet or computer to use it . The main advantage the Roku 2 has over the new Stick is the ability to plug into a wired Ethernet connection . If you have one near your TV , and experience dropouts over Wi-Fi , this box is the best value . Unless you want to pay extra for the dubious benefits of 4K , the 3 is still the best Roku overall , adding voice search and a headphone jack to the remote . All that stuff you bought on iTunes over the years ? Here 's the cheapest way to play it on the big screen . And no , Roku ca n't do that . In addition to everything on the old one , the new Apple TV has many of the apps and games you bought already on your iPhone , plus a great remote with superb voice search and recognition . Sarah Tew / CNET None of those apply to me . What else you got ? You must have a 4K streamer right now : Roku 4 ( $ 130 ) 4K TV shows and movies are rare and often expensive , do n't look much better than non-4K streams , and are probably already available on your 4K smart TV . Still interested ? Here 's the best option today . The Roku stick is a better all-around choice , but maybe you 're really into Amazon's TV shows and movies and would rather save $ 10 . Or , do n't save the $ 10 and get the Fire TV stick with the voice-control remote ( $ 50 total ) . Fire TV devices push Amazon stuff pretty hard , but maybe that 's OK with you , or you like the selection of games , or you want the cheapest 4K streamer . Admittedly , I 'm straining here . Built to appeal to tech geeks , the Shield with Android TV comes with a game controller and excels at serving up those thousands of "" files "" you have on your computer or network attached storage drive . You want local file access , but Shield is too expensive . Less affluent file-hoarding geeks should just use the excellent , free Plex app , which is available on every device above ( except for the old Apple TV ) . If you 're geeky enough to prefer Kodi instead , get an Amazon Fire TV device and side-load away , or use the old Google Nexus Player . There 's also the WD TV ( $ 135 ) , which is like VLC for your TV . Still too expensive ? Raspberry Pi ( $ 35 ) , maybe ? Sarah Tew / CNET Anything else I need to know ? Most of the major video apps are covered on every device . Just about all of these streamers have apps for Netflix , Hulu , YouTube , HBO , Showtime , Watch ESPN , Plex and PBS Kids , and all offer many , many more . New apps are added to these devices all the time , but there are still some gaps . Amazon access varies . Along with Netflix and YouTube , Amazon is one of the most popular streaming video sources . If you want to take advantage of Amazon Prime's unlimited streaming , or the retailer's vast catalog of for-rent and to-buy TV shows and movies , you should know that access varies . Apple TV , Chromecast and Android TV boxes like Nvidia Shield do not have a native app for Amazon . You can watch Amazon content on those devices , but it 's not as simple as clicking on the app icon . You have to fire up the Amazon app on your phone or tablet and use the "" casting "" feature -- namely Google Cast on the Chromecast and Android TV devices , or AirPlay for Apple TV -- to watch on your TV . All Roku and ( duh ) Amazon Fire TV devices have native Amazon apps that can access every video on Amazon . The exception is 4K , which varies by device , and HDR ( do n't ask ) . Sarah Tew / CNET You need HDMI , broadband Internet and good Wi-Fi . Nearly every streamer sold today requires an HDMI input , which excludes older TVs . If the TV you 're connecting to lacks HDMI , your only resort is an older streamer like the Roku 1 . You 'll also need a decent Internet connection . Most entry-level broadband packages will suffice , but streaming video quality may suffer especially during prime-time hours in the evening . Many streamers need a good Wi-Fi connection as well , and since they connect directly to your TV , you need to have plenty of bars in the living room . A good alternative is to use wired Ethernet , as long as your streaming device supports it . Consider a universal remote . Incorporating a streaming device into your system adds some complexity and another remote , so investing in a good universal model can be worth it for the convenience . I recommend Harmony , although IR-only models like the Harmony 650 ca n't control the streaming sticks . For that , you 'll need a hub-based Harmony like the Home Control . Roku also makes the best streaming TV . If futzing with another clicker seems like too much of a hassle you might be tempted to just stick with your Smart TV . The problem is , most ca n't hold a candle to a separate streaming device in terms of app selection , updates , search and ease of use . The solution ? Roku TV .

347,A14,"Crack cocaine misuse is treatable - given the appropriate skills Crack cocaine misuse can be treated effectively , but drug workers need to be provided with the skills to support and promote change amongst misusers . That was the message from the National Treatment Agency at today's crack cocaine conference in Birmingham . "" Research from the USA and the UK demonstrates that cognitive behavioural therapy approaches with a sympathetic counsellors , combined with low waiting times and ongoing aftercare , has a dramatic effect , "" explained Ms Dale-Perera , director of quality at the National Treatment Agency . "" Fifty-six per cent of those who entered treatment for crack cocaine misuse in the UK in 1998 were still drug-free four years after treatment . The National Treatment Agency ( NTA ) is calling for an improvement in drug services to ensure that drug workers have the knowledge and skills to treat the growing population of crack misusers and poly-drug misusers . This will form part of the NTA's wider strategy to improve the skills-base of drug workers through the development of standards and expansion of training .. Crack cocaine misuse is often accompanied by alcohol misuse and , increasingly , drug treatment services are having to respond to individuals misusing both heroin and cocaine . The interaction between different substances and their impact on users demands new approaches to treatment and the management of clients . The NTA is currently assessing the most effective forms of treatment and will publish the findings this summer . The Agency will then pilot new treatment models for crack cocaine later this year . Also this summer , the NTA will launch the equivalent of a national service framework for drug treatment services , setting out how services should be co-ordinated to obtain maximum benefit . For further details contact : Iris Steen , Communications Manager , NTA 020 7261 8620 email : iris . s teen @ nta-nhs . o rg . u k www . n ta . n hs . u k Notes to editors The National Treatment Agency ( NTA ) was created by the Government with a remit to increase the capacity , quality and effectiveness of drug treatment in England . Alternative arrangements are in place for Wales and Scotland . There is evidence of an increase in demand for treatment for crack misuse : 4 % of those seeking treatment in 1998 identified crack cocaine or cocaine as their main drug . This increased to 7 % in 2000 . 18 % of those seeking treatment in 1998 identified crack cocaine or cocaine as a secondary drug . This increased to 24 % in 2000 . There are strong regional varieties in crack cocaine / cocaine as the main drug : Trent - 2 % London - 21 % Eastern region - 6 % . Crack misusers are less likely than other drug misusers to seek treatment . This is partly because drug treatment services have traditionally developed to treat opiate misusers . There is therefore a limited awareness of the effectiveness and availability of crack treatment services , and a lesser skill-base within the treatment workforce . In addition , black and minority ethnic misusers are also less likely to seek treatment . The combination implies that black crack misusers are disadvantaged in the current drug treatment system . Effective treatment 56 % of those using crack at the start of treatment in 1998 , were not using it four years afterwards Most effective forms of treatment : Psycho-social interventions including structured counselling that is action focused , emphasising ability to manage and control situation Effective treatments : Address the immediate crisis and plan for the long-term Offer a portfolio of different forms of treatment Have low waiting times - crack misusers will not wait for treatment and are difficult to manage on a waiting list . The NTA has established targets for waiting times , provided guidance on management and is providing support to service providers via the NHS Modernisation Agency to minimise waiting times Deal with relapse prevention and the triggers that lead to relapse Have open , flexible client / counsellor relationship is crucial . Counsellor needs to : Be empathetic towards clients' situation Understand the chemical effects of crack ( including immediate effects leading to excited state , and longer term effects such as paranoia and depression ) . Needs to explain this to the client Be non-judgemental Understand the social background and related needs of individual clients Anti-depressants can support treatment for those with pre-existing depression that is not induced by drug misuse Community-based treatment is as effective as residential treatment for less chaotic users . Residential treatment appears to be more effective for those with complex , chaotic drug misuse Problems associated with crack cocaine misuse Distorts the brain chemistry and affects rational thinking and decision making abilities for months after usage . Drug treatment workers need to take this into consideration when planning treatment and assessing patient . Produces a state of excited delirium - extreme highs and lows . This can present itself as aggression . Induces depression , anxiety , paranoia Can lead to weight loss , chest problems if smoking crack , liver problems Many of those dependent on crack can not sustain misuse on a legitimate income , its use is therefore associated with acquisitive crime . Crack can lead to anxiety and paranoia , giving rise to offences involving violence . You can not overdose on crack cocaine in the same way that you can on heroin , therefore a user can spend a lot of money on one binge which can last for days . If crack misuse is combined with alcohol a third addictive substance is created ( cocathalene ) , leading to an additional addiction . Polydrug misuse is emerging as a new problem particularly as traditional heroin misusers are also starting to misuse crack . </doc>

1615,A7,"Any person , regardless of age , can benefit from having their spine evaluated by an upper cervical chiropractor . More specifically , every person that has experienced an accident or injury , of any type , should have their spine evaluated for a spinal misalignment . The effects of the spinal misalignment and spinal cord injury can be devastating and we encourage potential patients to have their spine checked as soon as possible . 2 . How did I get a spinal misalignment ? There are three specific causes to the spinal misalignment ( Atlas Subluxation Complex ) . The most common cause of the spinal misalignment is physical trauma . Accidents and injuries are a common occurance in our modern day society . Several examples are automobile accidents , athletic injuries , slips and falls around the home , traumatic childbirth , and work related injuries . Another common cause of the spinal misalignment is chemical toxicity . Excessive exposure to chemicals in our environment or medications can cause damage or weakness to the connective tissues of the spine . This results in spinal bones shifting out of proper alignment and injury to the nervous system . Several examples of chemical toxicity are excessive use of medications , pesticides and perservatives in our food supply , excessive use of certain personal hygiene products and exposure to chemicals at our place of employment . The final cause of the spinal misalignment is stressful thoughts and emotions . When we are continually influenced by high stress situations , our body and spinal structure begin to fatigue , which can result in a spinal misalignment . Highly stressful situations and relationships that disturb our emotional health often cause physical symptoms . 3 . Can an upper cervical chiropractor help me if I have had minimal results with other types of healthcare ? Please remember , the spinal misalignment ( Atlas Subluxation Complex ) can cause many complications in your health . An upper cervical chiropractor is trained to detect and correct a very specific condition ( Atlas Subluxation Complex ) which removes irritation to your nervous system and allows your body to recover . Other types of healthcare such as medicine , physical therapy , rehabilitation , massage therapy , and acupuncture are not equipped to detect and correct the spinal misalignment . Therefore , if you have sought other types of healthcare and not received any relief , we would encourage you to have your spine evaluated by an upper cervical chiropractor as soon as possible . Upper cervical chiropractic care is specifically designed to correct the root cause of body imbalance and diminished health . 4 . Is upper cervical spinal care painful ? NO ! NO ! and NO ! The spinal correction does not involve any twisting , popping or cracking of your head , neck or back . It is extremely gentle and many people , including babies , fall asleep on the table while they are being adjusted . Unlike other types of healthcare , we do not hurt you while we help you ! 5 . How safe is upper cervical spinal care ? Upper cervical spinal care is one of the safest types of healthcare available today . Patients do not experience any risk or discomfort during the adjustment . People under our care do not experience any negative side effects or irreversible dangers that many other types of modern healthcare may include . The upper cervical spinal correction is very gentle and every precaution is taken to ensure safety and effectiveness . 6 . I am worried about x-ray exposure , are x-rays necessary and what safety precautions are taken to limit x-ray exposure ? Your concern about x-ray exposure is valid , but please try to understand that the x-ray exposure is very minimal . Our clinical experience has revealed that the spinal misalignment ( Atlas Subluxation Complex ) creates much more destructive effects on the human body than the x-ray exposure from 5 cervical spine x-rays . The x-ray series is necessary to determine which direction your spine has been injured and how severely it has been injured . Upper cervical doctors use safety equipment and policies to limit your x-ray exposure and our x-ray machine is inspected regularly by the West Virginia Bureau of Public Health . Listed below are the amounts of x-ray exposure from various type of healthcare . Upper Cervical x-ray series < . 22 millirems Dental x-rays ( per x-ray ) 910 millirems CAT scan 4,500 millirems Barium enema ( x-ray study ) 8,000 millirems Radiation Therapy for cancer 6,000,000 millirems 7 . Why are x-rays taken before and after the upper cervical spinal correction ? The pre / post x-ray process is what distinguishes the upper cervical care from other types of healthcare . The pre-adjustment x-rays allow the doctor to deteremine how severely and in which direction your spine has misaligned . This information is critical for the doctor to perform the best spinal correction possible . Immediately following the spinal correction , the doctor will perform a series of post-adjustment x-rays . These x-rays verify that a favorable correction has been successfully accomplished . The best spinal alignment possible is necessary for your full recovery . The x-rays allow the doctor to see if proper alignment has occurred .... we will not guess with your health . 8 . Are x-rays necessary on follow-up visits ? No. Typically , the initial series of x-rays will provide the doctor with all the information that is necessary to care for you . Although , if a current patient experiences a new accident / injury , it may be necessary to perform a new series of x-rays so the patient can continue to recover as expected . 9 . Why does the doctor adjust the upper area of my neck when my problem is in my hands / arms , mid-back , low-back , or legs ? The spinal misalignment is most easily detected , measured and corrected by using the top bone of the spine as a lever to re-align the skull , the entire spine and the pelvis . When the spine is not in proper alignment , injury and irritation to the nervous system ( especially the brainstem ) can occur at any level within the spine . Therefore , uncomfortable symptoms and improper function can occur anywhere within the human body . The upper cervical doctor is merely using the top of the spine as an entry point to correct the entire structure . 10 . Why do I not always get adjusted when I am feeling bad ? The primary goal of upper cervical spinal care is to detect and correct the spinal misalignment . Sometimes the spine can begin to maintain proper alignment faster than patients experience relief from their specific complaint . If an upper cervical doctor checks your spinal alignment and discovers that you are maintaining your alignment , you can remain confident that your body will continue to recover over time . Remember , recovery is a process not an event ! 11 . Why do I sometimes get adjusted when I am feeling good ? The sooner your spine is corrected after losing your alignment , the less likely you are to experience uncomfortable symptoms . Your upper cervical doctor may recommend another spinal correction because your spine is not in proper alignment even though you have not begun to feel symptoms . By maintaining your alignment with periodic check-ups , you can prevent future problems from recurring . Your complete health is greatly enhanced by your committment to keeping your spine in proper alignment for your entire lifetime . After a person has had their spine properly aligned , they commonly experience many positive changes within their health . During the recovery process , people notice a reduction of symptoms and the restoration of proper body functions . Typically , after several weeks of care , the spine begins to maintain proper alignment and symptoms are usually completely resolved . If a patient were to lose their alignment at this point in their recovery , they would begin to experience similar symptoms . We greatly encourage you to have your spine checked by an upper cervical doctor immediately if you begin to experience uncomfortable symptoms . The longer your spine remains out of alignment , the more severe the symptoms will become and the sooner you have your spine corrected , the sooner you can experience life without discomfort and dysfunction . 13 . How often should I get my spinal alignment checked after I have been released from scheduled visits ? After being released from scheduled visits and educated on wellness care , we recommend having your spine checked by an upper cervical doctor at least once every three months ( 4 check-ups / year ) , similar to dental check-ups ! Please remember , your commitment to maintaining your spinal alignment can have life changing effects upon your health . We recommend lifetime family spinal care for everyone ... your teeth are replaceable , but your spine and nervous system are not ! Most patients experience a noticeable change in how they feel immediately after their first spinal correction . During the first week after beginning upper cervical spinal care , most patients continue to experience many positive benefits such as : extended pain relief , more restful sleep , more energy , and proper organ function . Most patients will experience complete recovery from their primary complaint within 4-6 weeks from their initial spinal correction . Long term benefits of maintaining your alignment are a greatly enhanced immune system , higher energy levels , no stress / tension in your body , properly functioning organs , increased performance and mental clarity , a strong feeling of vitality and the prevention of future health problems . You can be confident that when you leave our office from your first spinal correction that we have achieved the best spinal alignment possible . This is what ensures your quickest and complete recovery . Our standard protocol for initial care is to check your spine and monitor your improvement once per week for 4-6 weeks . ( This may be shorter or longer depending on the severity of your condition ) After this time period , we usually perform a re-evaluation to determine the need for additional care and make recommendations to you that should decrease your recovery time . 16 . How long will I need upper cervical spinal care ? You only need upper cervical spinal care until your primary complaint has been resolved and you have achieved your individual health related goals . But , we hope that by experiencing upper cervical spinal care and understanding the benefits of maintaining your alignment , that you will want to keep you spine corrected . As mentioned in a previous question , the long term benefits of upper cervical spinal care are profound . 17 . Why is complete recovery not a faster process ? The underlying principle behind upper cervical spinal care is that the human body can heal and maintain itself ... if it is cared for properly . Once the spine is corrected and the irritation is removed from the nervous system , the amazing human body is able to heal and recover . Every person's recovery time is different , but we can assure you that by having a positive mindset and patience , your chances of experiencing complete recovery are greatly enhanced . Also , your upper cervical doctor may make other recommendations ( nutrition , exercise , rest and lifestyle behaviors ) to help decrease your recovery time . The more you become involved in your care , the quicker you will recover ! 18 . Is it safe to care for pregnant women with upper cervical care ? Yes ! Upper cervical spinal corrections are very safe for a pregnant woman , and it is very important for pregnant women to have their spines adjusted . Having their spine aligned has no dangerous side effects and the benefits for better health influence both the expectant mom and the baby . The importance of the spinal correction during pregnancy is vital because the nervous system controls and coordinates all body functions including the growth and development of the baby . For the baby to grow and develop to its fullest potential , the women's nervous system needs to be functioning at an optimal level . Upper cervical spinal care will facilitate the optimal functioning of the pregnant women's nervous system . Also , most women under upper cervical spinal care have easier childbirth and less medical intervention during the delivery of their child ! 19 . Is it safe to x-ray pregnant women ? Yes . Upper cervical spinal care relies upon x-rays to detect and correct the spinal misalignment and several precautions are implemented to insure the safety of the woman and the developing baby . The x-rays focus on the head and neck region of the body and therefore the x-ray exposure is very limited . A full lead apron is used as a precaution to protect the baby from receiving any radiation . All women are encouraged to have their spine checked and corrected before becoming pregnant to facilitate the entire experience . Pregnant women experience many benefits from having their spine aligned and the precautions used prevent any harmful effects to the baby . In fact , the baby will benefit with proper growth and development and an easier delivery . 20 . Do you care for babies and children with the upper cervical care ? Absolutely ! Children grow , develop and heal through their nervous system . Therefore , their nervous system must be functioning at optimal levels for proper growth , development and healing to occur . In fact , it is most important for young children to have their spines checked for misalignment because the long term effects of nervous system distress are devastating . Many research studies are indicating that children who have their spines checked and corrected experience positive life-long effects in their health and well-being . After understanding the safety and positive effects of upper cervical spinal care , you may ask youself , "" Why would anyone not have their child's spine checked for a misalignment ? "" It is safe , painless , drug-free and it greatly enhances your childs' ability to grow , develop and heal . </doc>

1650,A16,"Democrats lost control of the State Senate in the November 2010 elections , and removed Klein from his role as their chief election strategist . In 2011 , Klein resigned as the Democrats' deputy leader and formed the IDC with Valesky , Carlucci , and Savino . Though Democrats won the majority of seats in the November 2012 election , the IDC continued to caucus with the Republicans , denying Democrats the majority of the chamber . Republicans gained outright control of the State Senate in the November 2014 elections , and the IDC remained with the Republican caucus in a diminished role . Democrats gained the majority of seats in the November 2016 elections , but the IDC again agreed to work with Republicans . Brooklyn Senator Simcha Felder conferences with the GOP and cast his vote for a GOP leader , giving Republicans the majority and outright control of the chamber . Following the leadership crisis , Republicans won control of the chamber in the November 2010 elections . In the fallout of the 2010 elections , Democrats replaced Klein as their chief strategist in December 2010 . Klein stepped down as deputy minority leader in January 2011 , citing disagreements with John L. Sampson , the Minority Leader of the State Senate . A few days after resigning as deputy minority leader , Klein formed a group of four Democratic Senators , also including Diane Savino , David J. Valesky , and David Carlucci , announced that they would form their own caucus within the State Senate called the "" Independent Democratic Conference "" , because they no longer approved of the Sampson's leadership . Sampson offered the IDC members minor roles on committees , and Klein reached out to Dean Skelos , the Republican leader . Skelos agreed to give the four members chairmanships of standing committees . Democratic Senators , including Ruth Hassell-Thompson , criticized Klein for leaving the campaign committee in debt and following his own personal ambitions . In the November 2012 elections , Democrats won the majority of seats in the State Senate . However , a week after the election , Simcha Felder , a newly elected Democrat , announced his intentions to caucus with the Republican Party . In December , the IDC recruited Malcolm Smith and agreed to caucus with the Republicans instead of the Democrats , giving Republicans control . Klein struck a deal with Skelos to alternate who would preside over the chamber every two weeks . Tony Avella joined the IDC in February 2014 . Liberal activists working with the Democratic Party and the Working Families Party targeted Klein and Avella during the Democratic primary elections in September 2014 , with Oliver Koppell challenging Klein and John Liu challenging Avella . Due to pressure from Governor Andrew Cuomo and labor unions , Klein indicated in June 2014 that the IDC would rejoin the Democratic caucus after the November 2014 elections . Still , the IDC supported Betty Jean Grant ' s unsuccessful primary challenge against Timothy M. Kennedy , due to her pro-choice political stance . Klein and Avella won their primaries . In the general election , Republicans won control of the Senate outright , with Skelos assuming complete control . Though the new Democratic leader , Andrea Stewart-Cousins , had continued discussions with Klein about the IDC rejoining the Democrats , the IDC members decided to remain with the Republicans in the 2015 legislative session . During the 2015 session , the IDC successfully pushed the Republicans to include paid family leave and a $ 15 per hour minimum wage in the state budget . Klein also pushed for more funding to the New York City Housing Authority , and obtained $ 100 million . During Skelos ' 2015 trial for corruption , a wiretapped conversation was aired where Skelos argued that in their power sharing agreement , the IDC would have no real power and it would serve to hinder Democrats by keeping them divided . Klein indicated that this recording would not change the IDC agreement with Republicans . Heading into the November 2016 elections , Klein would not commit to rejoining the Democrats . Following the 2014 primary challenges , the IDC formed their own campaign committee through an agreement with the Independence Party of New York . After the elections , newly elected Senators Marisol Alcantara and Jesse Hamilton joined the IDC . Despite pressure from liberal activists to find a way to unite the 24 mainstream Democrats with the IDC and Felder to form a 32-member majority , including Stewart-Cousins attempting to involve Cuomo , the IDC and Felder continued their relationships with the 31 Senate Republicans , giving Republicans the majority in the 2017 legislative session . In January , Jose Peralta joined the IDC . Following the election and inauguration of Donald Trump as President of the United States , Democrats and constituents of the IDC members began to criticize the IDC for enabling Republican control . </doc>

1528,A12,"FIND US ON Low-intensity laser delivers high-end results "" The wonderful thing about dentistry is that there 's always something new being studied or developed to improve the patient experience , deliver better results , or both , "" observes Michael J. Andersen , DDS . One innovation that Dr. Andersen introduced to his practice last year is the diode laser . This low-intensity light source allows him to treat the soft tissue of the gums and mouth with gentleness and thoroughness , while reducing blood loss and speeding healing . Dr. Andersen explains that the diode laser replaces two instruments used to make incisions on gum tissue : the scalpel and the electro-surge . "" The scalpel offers great precision , but cutting into gum tissue causes a wound that bleeds and often results in a painful healing period , "" he describes . "" If a patient needs a crown that requires a reduction in gum tissue , the bleeding can interfere with our ability to take an accurate impression of the tooth being treated . The diode laser allows me to ' brush ' the gum tissue with light waves , reducing the tissue without pain and without blood loss , so an impression is easier and quicker to acquire , and recovery is much quicker and more comfortable . "" An electro-surge also makes incisions in gum tissue , but uses electrical current that requires the patient to be "" grounded "" against electrical shock . The device can not be used near conductive materials like metal crowns , implants , or fillings because of the risk of arcing . Other uses Dr. Andersen adds that in orthodontic work , it is often necessary to reduce the space between teeth . This compresses the gum tissue in those spaces , causing it to appear puffed up or bulgy . "" I can use the diode laser to reduce the bulging tissue between the teeth to give it a more natural appearance without triggering a sensitive reaction , "" he says . "" A small amount of peroxide will clean the area and by the time a patient gets home after the appointment , the gum tissue looks and feels comfortable . Within a day or two , the appearance is completely natural . "" A diode laser is also a benefit for patients who need a frenectomy , or a reduction of the fibrous muscle under the lip over the front teeth . In some patients , this muscle is exceptionally strong and pulls the gums forward , away from the teeth . The pull of this muscle can even cause the front teeth to separate . "" In the past , we had to numb the area thoroughly , clamp the muscle off , use a scalpel to cut it , then place sutures to close the resulting wound , "" says Dr. Andersen . "" It could take up to two-and-a-half weeks to heal . With the diode laser , we can use a topical anesthetic , ' cut ' the muscle back , and finish without placing a single suture . The area may be sensitive for about a day , but after that there is no discomfort . "" One of the newest uses for the diode laser is in the treatment of periodontal disease . Stronger lasers have been used for several years in tooth root planing and scaling to treat bacteria embedded in the deep ' pockets ' in the gums surrounding the teeth . The process left the mouth sensitive , and there was always a certain amount of bacteria left behind . Dr. Andersen and Staff "" Using a diode laser to reach deep into the pocket after root planing and scaling , we do n't actually cut into the tissue but rather guide this more gentle laser to sterilize the pocket , "" informs Dr. Andersen . "" Then , we use a special attachment to the diode laser that allows us to use the light energy to warm the surrounding gum tissue , which increases circulation and speeds the healing process . "" The diode laser can also be used to help decontaminate the wound bed of a cold sore or canker sore on the lips or in the mouth . This reduces the sensitivity usually associated with mouth ulcers and reduces healing time . "" This treatment needs to be applied before the ulcer begins to heal on its own , or the laser will simple reopen the wound , "" cautions Dr. Andersen . "" But when these sores are just developing and open , the diode laser offers a real benefit in pain reduction and healing time . "" I have been using the diode laser with great success for some time , now , for a variety of applications , and I 've found it to be an excellent advance for keeping my patients more comfortable when tissue has to be reduced or when certain surgical procedures need to be performed . "" Michael J. Andersen , DDS , earned his undergraduate degree from Ohio University and his Doctor of Dental Surgery degree from Case Western Reserve University , Cleveland . Dr. Andersen also completed a post-doctoral program in advanced general ... Read More </doc>

81,A1,"The Netherlands : A Holiday Season of Festivities , Costumes ... and Racism ? In the winter season in The Netherlands a character named Zwarte Piet ( Black Pete ) accompanies Sinterklaas ( Saint Nicholas , the original inspiration for Santa Claus ) for a yearly feast that is celebrated on the evening of December 5 or morning of December 6 with sweets and presents for all good children . This traditional holiday rivals Christmas in importance . In recent years the role of Zwarte Piet has become part of a recurring debate in The Netherlands as some citizens take offense at holiday costumes with black painted faces . The story goes that the companions of Saint Nicholas are Moors who help carry the presents brought to children when he arrives by boat from Spain . The tradition continues to be popular , though some have been moved to protest against what they see as racist imagery . On November 12 , 2011 a protester wearing a t-shirt that said ' Zwarte Piet is racisme ' ( Black Pete is racism ) was arrested in Dordrecht amidst accusations of police brutality . The t-shirt campaign has its own Tumblr blog with photos and a Facebook page with more than 800 followers . The blogger at Stuff Dutch People Like wrote in 2010 about the tradition of Zwarte Piet : You know it 's that time of the year again in Holland , when you are greeted by some Dutch person on the street , whose face is painted completely black and is sporting an afro wig , bright red lips and a ridiculous clown-like costume . Sinterklaas and Zwarte Piet , The Hague , The Netherlands , November 2008 , by Zemistor ( CC-BY-ND ) Dutch graffiti artist and blogger BNE posts some photos of Zwarte Piet , and asks : Is The Dutch Holiday Of Sinterklaas's Tradition Of "" Black Pete "" Racist ? : This "" tradition "" has evolved throughout the years , partially due to increasing protests from groups that find these depictions offensive . Nowadays , it is claimed that the Black face is due to the fact that the helpers have gone through chimneys and as a result , their faces are covered in soot . What again , nobody can clearly explain , is what kind of soot leaves such a uniform and evenly spread residue . Or worse , why these "" chimney dwellers "" speak in a fake accent that parodies the Black population of the Dutch former colony of Suriname . Anthropologist and blogger Martijn de Koning of CLOSER explains in Jolly Black Servant – Tradition and Racism in the Netherlands : I dont expect a change in this tradition very soon . It should be clear however that Black Pete is a construction , and invention that has already changed in history . The current tradition has lost many of negative connotations which is partly positive but the negative side is that this makes the racism more hidden . Nevertheless , I think this Dutch tradition lends itself perfectly for teaching young children about racism , colonialism and religion throughout history . Maybe that would be a starting point for some change in the future ? On travel website Off Track Planet , Anna Starostinetskaya gives this answer to the question , What the F * ck is Zwarte Piet ? : So is Pete a children's tale or a racist figure ? We promise no definitive answer exists . We 're not saying this tradition is not objectifying black people in a racist way and it is understandable that Americans have the strongest feelings on the topic because Zwarte Piet is visually too close to what our racist roots look like . But Americans must also realize that our own history drives us to apply what we know about our own racist past on traditions that may not have anything in common but black face paint . Although it may be racist in some way , we can not just superimpose our own racist history atop another country's tradition and say it 's the same . Either way , we hope a happy medium exists that does n't involve smurfs , midgets or complete Americanization of world traditions . Sinterklaas arrives by boat in Arnhem , November 2011 , by Bas Boerman ( CC-BY-NC ) On the blog Tiger Beatdown , beneath Flavia's post "" If you protest racism during Black Face season in The Netherlands , you will be beaten up and arrested "" a comment by Elfe echoes the above : I read your post because I needed to understand why I do not find this tradition racist ... The "" slaves "" or "" helpers "" are you refer to them are not ridicule : these are pages not clowns and they are wearing nice clothes , they are not parading around half naked with a bone across their nostrils like some savages ( or like Josephine Baker and her banana skirt ) .... Like "" Tintin in the Congo "" the Zwarte Piets are a reminder of the past .... I know it is very insulting for Blacks in America to see White people with their face painted in black ( but it took me to live in the US to understand why : a period when black were not even allowed to play their own role in theater ) . ... Like the rappers who have decided to own the N word we can just ignore this tradition if it annoys us , personally I could not care less . Being African I do n't see the Zwarte Piets as Blacks ( they do n't look like me or like any African I know ) ... To feel insulted by them you really need to have a really poor self-esteem . Sorry for being politically incorrect ... Written by Anna Gueye </doc>

1545,A8,""" The Minnesota Twins organization would like to thank the USGBC for this wonderful recognition of Target Field , "" Twins Owner and CEO Jim Pohlad said . "" Gaining LEED certification has been a longstanding goal for the Twins , Hennepin County and the Minnesota Ballpark Authority as we have collectively shared the responsibility to ensure strong environmental stewardship . It 's our sincere hope that the sustainability aspects of Target Field will provide inspiration to other local , regional and national projects of this magnitude . "" The USGBC originally created the LEED Certification process to promote environmentally responsible design in such buildings as offices , schools and hospitals . Only recently has the sporting world realized the impact LEED Certification could have on its building types . Design firm Populous managed the LEED Certification process for Target Field and has been a pioneer in the greening of sports facilities . This is the firm's fourth sports facility to achieve LEED Certification . "" Target Field is baseball's most urban ballpark , and the site constraints we faced were actually paramount to achieving LEED Certification , "" said Earl Santee , Populous Senior Principal . "" With the addition of new , immediate access to public transportation at the ballpark , we 've helped to bridge the site to its urban surroundings as a model for positive growth . That 's at the heart of why this recognition is so important . "" Set in the Warehouse District of downtown Minneapolis , Target Field's site dictated much of the approach to LEED Certification . The ballpark rests on soil that once was contaminated . That soil was treated and replaced . Also , a massive cistern system buried under the warning track will contain storm water that will be specially filtered and reused to wash down the seating bowl and for irrigation . Target Field is also the hub for a variety of public transportation options , including rail , bike and bus routes . "" Earning LEED Certification was a priority for Hennepin County from the time we undertook the ballpark project four years ago . On top of everything else that has made Target Field a successful and gratifying partnership , I 'm proud of this recognition for our environmental stewardship , "" said Hennepin County Board Chair Mike Opat . "" The Board is appreciative of all the good that was done to earn this Silver Certification . "" Target Field received 36 points toward LEED Certification -- 2 more than Nationals Park received , thus becoming the most sustainable outdoor baseball facility in the country . Many of Target Field's LEED points were based on innovative design , construction and operations measures , some never before implemented into ballpark design . Some of the green design elements included : Energy use reduction – achieved through high efficiency field lighting , interior lighting and heating / cooling and ventilation equipment . Water use reduction – achieved through water-saving fixtures such as low-flow urinals and dual-flush toilets as well as a specially designed rain water filter system used to capture runoff , filter it and use it both to wash down the seating bowl and for irrigation . Game Day Recycling – Recyclable collection points stationed conveniently around Target Field will keep an estimated 400 cubic yards of material over the course of a three-game home stand from going to landfills . Public transportation access – Target Field was built to include a public transportation hub where commuter and light rail lines terminate , adjacent to a major bus hub as well as access by bike riders and pedestrians . Recycled Materials – More than 30 % of all installed materials are made up of recycled content including the canopy structure , masonry blocks , carpet and the foul poles . Local Materials – Locally sourced materials were used to limit energy costs related to shipping and also stimulated the local economy . Construction Waste – In an effort to reduce the impact on local landfills , more than 70 % of the waste generated through the construction of Target Field was recycled or reused . This included all concrete , wood , cardboard , metals and paper . The 2006 ballpark legislation made LEED certification a goal of the project , if grant funds were available to assist in the effort . With the ballpark's aggressive design and construction schedule , the project team could not wait on the outcome of outside grant requests . To address this issue and ensure LEED certification efforts continued , the Minnesota Twins provided $ 1 . 5 million , and the Minnesota Ballpark Authority provided $ 1 million in additional resources , in December of 2007 . </doc>

795,A14,"Scientific Motivation : We will determine representative structures of human members from protein families of importance in different metabolic routes . These pathways comprise synthesis and catabolism of lipids , steroids , retinoids , carbohydrates , nucleotides , cofactors and amino acids . A major focus is on oxidoreductases of different superfamilies , but other selected enzymes or binding proteins are targeted as well . Proteins from different classes involved in synthetic and catabolic routes of the building blocks mentioned above are involved in a large array of inherited diseases , hence structural analysis will give insights into their molecular mechanisms . Furthermore , several enzymes involved in these metabolic pathways constitute drug targets for the treatment of a variety of metabolic disorders , such as diabetes , osteoporosis and in oncology therapy . Techniques Used : This biology group is responsible for functional expression , characterization , crystallization and structure determination of targets described above . Together with the biotechnology , biophysical and x-ray teams we will process the targets and determine their structures , with overlapping and integrated activities among the teams . Techniques employed are primarily development of heterologous expression systems and purification strategies , development of functional assays , crystallization , and furthermore functional analysis by biophysical methods ( mainly spectroscopy , but also mass spectrometry , microcalorimetry and analytical ultracentrifugation ) . </doc>

1640,A1,"The iPhone was released in 2007 . E-books reached the mainstream in the late 1990s . Printed books have been around since the 1450s . But how did writing move around before then ? After all , a book – electronic or not – is simply a mechanism for making written information portable . And our ancestors were as eager to take their reading on the go as we are . Here are seven ways that people used to record information and carry it around . Papyrus Rolls Mary Evans Picture Library / age fotostock Meanwhile , in ancient Egypt , papyrus emerged as a medium for writing . It was derived from the stalk of the so-called paper plant , Cyperus papyrus , which was sliced into strips and dried so that it resembled something akin to what we know as paper . Ancient Egyptians plundered C. papyrus for many other uses – mostly for what we 'd use various fabrics today – but recording writing was papyrus's most widespread , and enduring , use . As in Mesopotamia , the task of writing in Egypt was given to scribes ; Egyptian scribes , however , used a brush or a pen to write in cursive script on papyrus rather than imprint a wet piece of clay . A papyrus roll might consist of up to 20 sheets of papyrus , all glued together . Unlike clay tablets , however , papyrus rolls were fragile and prone to damage . Some existing rolls date to 2500 BCE , though papyrus was likely to have been in use before then . Papyrus rolls were also used in ancient Greece and during the time of the Roman Empire . Ostraca David Liam Moran Papyrus was n't the only option that ancient Egyptians had . Ostraca – the plural of ostracon – were bits of pottery or limestone that were often used to jot down business matters . The Egyptians also turned ostraca into sketchpads , often with amusing results . Ancient Greeks and Hebrews used ostraca too . Bamboo Tablets and Silk Scrolls Courtesy of the Cleveland Museum of Art , John L. Severance Fund The Chinese also created tablets that were made from bamboo or wood and were lashed together with the equivalent of rope . Records suggest that these may have emerged by 1300 BCE , if not before , but many simply rotted away or otherwise decayed . The emperor Shihuangdi also did n't help in 213 BCE when he ordered that most books not in his possession be burned . During roughly the same time , the Chinese also created scrolls made of silk , though these scrolls were not always rolled into a cylindrical form ; some of the documents written on silk that were found , for example , at Mawangdui , an archaeological site in southeastern China that dates to the 2nd century BCE , were found folded into rectangles . The texts on these tablets and scrolls covered a wide range of topics , from medicine to poetry to philosophy . Wax Tablets Wax tablets were a riff on the ancient Mesopotamian clay tablets , courtesy of the ancient Greeks and Romans . Clay tablets could be awkward to work with ; papyrus could be a pain to prepare and store . But filling a wooden block with hot wax that , after it cooled , provided a smooth soft writing surface ? Simple . And cheap too . Permanence was a bit of a problem , but it was also an advantage : the wax could be remelted or scraped smooth , and the tablet was ready for use again . The Greeks and the Romans , and medieval Europeans after them , used these tablets for some important legal documentation , but their primary advantage was flexibility – very much like a paper ( or electronic ) tablet today . Codices Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library , Yale University A codex – the singular of codices – was the last stop on the way to the modern printed book . It represented an innovation that today is a bit difficult to recognize as an innovation : why bother with the seemingly endless writing surface of a papyrus roll when you can pile all of that on top of itself and then hold it together along one edge ? That was the codex . It offered easy access to any point within the text ; it was compact and easy to carry ; and it could accommodate a great deal of information – on the front and the back of the writing surface – in a small physical space . Codices were a particularly convenient medium for storing and presenting the New Testament Gospels – and it was after the time of Christ , in Europe , that the codex took hold . ( Codices were also created , from about 1000 CE , in Mesoamerica . ) Early codices were handwritten and consisted of vellum or parchment ( both of which , though , have a longer history than codices ) or , later , paper . They coexisted with rolls for several hundred years , but by the 4th century codices – buoyed by the spread and entrenchment of Christianity in Europe – had begun to dominate . They were widely used until the middle of the 15th century , when Johannes Gutenberg helped to usher in the era of the book printed with movable type on paper and bound at the spine , a form that has endured to this day . </doc>

476,A16,"Beaver Miller - Original Model A also badged as "" Grimston "" Manuals & Parts Lists for most models of Beaver Miller are available Beaver Model A - Click HERE for Detailed Photographs Mk . 1 & Mk . 2 VBRP If any reader has early Beaver Advertising or Maintenance Literature , I would be pleased to hear from them A Beaver Model A owner would like to have contact with fellow owners to discuss head details The Beaver Turret-head vertical miller Model "" A "" was manufactured by Balding Engineering ( originally jobbing engineers ) of the Old Tramways Power Station , Duke Street , Norwich and then Sweet Briar Road in the same city . A number of this model were also badged as "" Grimston "" ( a London machine-tool manufacturer and merchant ) and sometimes lacked the cast Beaver badge on the right-hand side of the main column ; the paint finish was also unusual on the Grimston version , a "" splatter "" mix of dark grey , green and red not dissimilar to that also used on some American ROTEX millers of the same era . In its original form , as introduced during the early 1950s , this little miller proved to be a compact , versatile machine equally at home in the toolroom or on the shop floor - and absolutely ideal when its industrial life was over , for the workshop of the enthusiastic amateur . In 1957 it was succeeded by the very much larger and heavier MK . 1 and Mk 2 and "" VBRP "" models , details of which ( today the most common "" Beaver "" on the used market ) can be seen here . In the 1980s , on the back of considerable success in exporting the VBRP range , the company opened a new factory in Peterborough to manufacture a range of CNC lathes to compliment the CNC millers and CNC machining centres already in production ; unfortunately the severe recession in manufacturing industry of 1992 ( when demand for machine tools fell by 50 % in 3 months ) caused the company to close .. The original 1950s miller had a 28 "" x 6 "" table ( with three 9 / 16 "" T slots ) a longitudinal travel of 15 "" , a cross feed of 7.5 "" and a vertical movement of 13.75 "" . A table power-feed motor was fitted as standard and drove a 4-speed gear box ; to change the rate of table feed "" pick-off "" gears were used where operator removed a side panel , pulled off the gears on two studs ( they were retained by snap-on wire springs ) and changed them for another pair from the four supplied . The head was driven by a simple and reliable two-stage V-belt arrangement with an adjustable intermediate pulley carried in a T slot ; an over-centre toggle lever released the belt tension to change speeds and the whole of the belt run was guarded by a rather fragile hinged , cast-aluminium cover . The head swung on top of the column , slid in and out of its housing and swivelled through 90 degrees each way - allowing the spindle nose to be brought to within 3.5 "" of the column face or moved away to give a maximum clearance of 9.75 "" . The quill , with 3 "" of travel and a No. 30 International fitting , was fitted with both fine and quick-action feeds and driven by a 0.75 hp 3-phase motor through 7 speeds in two ranges arranged ( through the intermediate pulley ) of 200 , 330 , and 500 on Low-Range and 350 , 1420 , 2200 , 3600 rpm on High . The quill movement was measured by a vertical ruler and adjustable micrometer dial - and fitted with a very useful screw-adjusted ' pre-set ' depth stop . Because the electric motor mounts directly onto the back of a Beaver "" headbar "" , changing it is a very simple operation . The table power-feed motor , however , is flange-mounted to the back of the knee - and is not such an easy prospect for modification ; however , this type of small 3-phase motor is usually amenable to being run on a single-phase supply by using the old trick of linking two of the three-phase terminals with a suitable capacitor . For the home or smaller professional workshop the Beaver Mill "" A "" is one of the few machines that combines quality , size and functionality in just the right proportions . A Universal version , the "" AH "" , was also manufactured - but this is a comparatively rare machine and , unaccountably , used a completely different type of vertical head . Balding also built a 4.5 "" x 20 "" backgeared , screwcutting lathe of conventional design but robust construction . of which details can be found </doc>

1154,A1,"School Choice – An Unwise Option The topic of charter schools and vouchers is an ongoing debate that is currently being argued in places from the local school board meetings to state supreme courts . Both charter schools and school voucher programs are collectively referred to as "" school choice "" initiatives , in that they allow parents to choose educational options for their children that are outside of the traditional public school system . A school voucher program provides parents with certificates that are used to pay for education at a school of their choice , rather than the public school to which they are assigned . Charter schools on the other hand are publicly funded schools that have been freed from some of the rules , regulations , and statutes that apply to other public schools . In exchange , charter schools have specialized accountability for producing certain results , which are set forth in each school's charter . As Americans we enjoy choices and often associate choice as something positive . Being able to choose a school may sound like a reasonable initiative on the surface , but after a closer look it has serious problems . School choice turns out to not only be a bad idea ; it 's also a violation of our constitution . Considering the many challenges facing public schools , it 's understandable that many people would be eager to pursue new options . Supporters of school choice point out that under the current public school system , parents with economic means already exercise school choice by moving from areas with failing or dangerous schools to neighborhoods with better , safer schools . Their argument is that school choice would allow all parents the freedom , regardless of income level , to select the school that provides the best education ( Chub and Moe ) . Schools would then have to compete for students by offering higher academic results and greater safety . Schools unable to measure up to the standards of successful schools would fail and possibly close . Activists within the school choice movement can be applauded for seeking to improve public education , but the changes they propose would in fact seriously damage public education as a whole . One of the biggest dangers of school choice is the power behind large corporations specializing in opening and operating charter schools . Two notable companies are Green Dot , which is the leading public school operator in Los Angeles ( Green Dot ) , and KIPP , which operates 65 schools in 19 different states [ KIPP ] . These companies represent a growing trend of privatization of public schools by large corporations . It is feared that these corporations could grow to a point that public control of education would be lost . Education policy would be left in the hands of entrepreneurial think tanks , corporate boards of directors , and lobbyists who are more interested in profit than educating students [ Miller and Gerson ] . Education should be left in the hands of professional educators and not business people with MBAs . To do otherwise is not only dangerous , it defies common sense . The validity of school voucher programs has met numerous challenges , with results varying from state to state . At the center of the divided opinions is whether or not it is constitutional for the federal government to give money directly to private schools , many of which are religiously based . According to the NEA "" About 85 percent of private schools are religious . Vouchers tend to be a means of circumventing the Constitutional prohibitions against subsidizing religious practice and instruction [ NEA ] . "" One might view a parent's choice to send children to a religious school using government funded school vouchers as acceptable considering that family pays taxes and it 's only fair that they have a say in where the money is spent on behalf of their children . But consider the many people who have no children , or who have grown children that no longer participate in the public school system . These people still pay taxes to support public education , and it is only reasonable to consider that they may object to the funding of religious schools with the tax money they are paying . It is clear from any point of view that far more people object to voucher programs than benefit . The public school system guarantees an education for every child in our nation . It becomes apparent that this is n't the case after examining the various school choice options . One must also consider the fate of special needs students which require many additional hours of direct teacher attention . These students could easily be viewed as "" too expensive "" to educate and could face sub-standard treatment or even exclusion in profit minded , corporate operated , charter schools . Even voucher programs possess a hidden selective element when one considers that religious schools are allowed to choose their students . Parents may apply to the school for admission of their children , but the school may choose to not admit them [ ATF ] . The only way to truly guarantee equality in public education is to invest in our public education system . America was the first country to provide public education to all and we must ensure that it is not eroded by school choice . It can bee seen that charter schools , while attractive at first , fade under closer examination . The dangers of huge corporations taking control of education are real . Consider what would have happened if Enron was involved in education . And voucher programs , also attractive under first light , become less appealing after considering their constitutional legality and the fact that private schools are allowed to practice a form of "" student choice "" . All of the school choice initiatives are answers to the problems facing public education . But consider that for decades public education has suffered from lack of proper funding [ Haider-Markel ] . Without proper funding , public schools have never had a legitimate chance to succeed . Why do n't people pursue a simple answer to a simple problem ? American's should fund the public schools adequately so they can get the job done . It 's a simple answer that will work . </doc>

921,A4,"A Dash from Diamond City George Manville Fenn | Next chapter | | Previous chapter | | Contents | Chapter XXXVIII . The Surgeon's Words . "" Bad enough , poor fellow ; but I think I can pull them both round . Nothing vital , you see , touched , and these Mauser bullets make wonderfully clean wounds ! "" "" And the other ? "" "" Bad flesh-wounds--great loss of blood . I just got at that artery in time . "" West heard these words spoken by someone whose head kept getting in his way as he lay staring up at the great bright stars directly overhead , and it seemed very tiresome . He tried to speak and ask whoever it was to move aside ; but his tongue would not stir , and he lay perfectly still , trying to think what it all meant , and in a dull far-off sort of way it gradually dawned upon him that the people near him were talking about the Boers he had somehow or another and for some reason shot down . Then , as he thought , the calm feeling he was enjoying grew troubled , and he began to recall the fact that he had been shooting somebody's ponies to supply somebody else with food , and that he must have been mad , for he felt convinced that they would not be nice eating , as he had heard that the fat was oily and the flesh tasted sweet . Besides which , it would be horrible to have to eat horseflesh at a time when his throat was dry with an agonising thirst . Then the terrible thought forced itself upon him that while shooting down ponies he had missed them and killed men instead , and once more all was blank . The next time the power of thinking came to the poor fellow all was very dark , and a jarring pain kept running through him , caused by the motion of his hard bed , which had somehow grown wheels and was being dragged along . Cattle were lowing and sheep bleating . There were shouts , too , such as he knew were uttered by Kaffir drivers , and there were the crackings of their great whips . After a while he made out the trampling of horses and heard men talking , while in an eager confused way he listened for what they would say about those two wounded Boers , one of whom had nearly bled to death before that artery was stopped . These , he felt , must be the Boers he shot when he ought to have shot ponies . And as he got to that point the trouble of thinking worried his brain so that he could think no more , and again all was blank . At last came a morning when West woke up in a great room which seemed to be familiar . There were nurses moving about in their clean white-bordered dresses , and he knew that he was in some place fitted up as a hospital . Several of the occupants of the beds wore bandages suggestive of bad wounds , and to help his thoughts there came from time to time the dull heavy reports of cannon . He did not recollect all that had preceded his coming yet ; but he grasped the fact that he had been wounded and was now in hospital . He lay for a few minutes with his brain growing clearer and clearer , and at last , seeing one of the nurses looking in his direction , he tried to raise one hand , but could not . The other proved more manageable , and in obedience to a sign the nurse came , laid a hand upon his forehead , and smiled down in his face . "" Your head's cooler ! "" she said . "" You 're better ? "" "" Yes , "" he replied : "" have I been very bad ? "" "" Terribly ! We thought once that you would not recover . "" "" And Ingleborough ? "" "" Ingleborough ? Oh , you mean your companion who was brought in with you ? "" West nodded : he could not speak . "" Well , I think he will get better now ! "" "" But his wound : is it so bad ? "" "" He nearly bled to death ; but you must not talk much yet . "" "" Only a little ! "" said West eagerly . "" Pray tell me , he will get better ? "" "" Oh yes : there 's no doubt about it , I believe . "" "" Oh , thank goodness ! "" cried West fervently . "" But what place is this ? "" "" This ? Why , Kimberley , of course ! "" "" Ah ! "" cried West excitedly , and his hand went to his breast . "" My jacket ! "" "" Your jacket ? "" said the nurse . "" Oh , that was all cut and torn , and soaked with blood . I think it has been burnt . "" "" What ! "" cried West . "" Oh , do n't say that ! "" "" Hush , hush ! What is this ? "" said a deep , stern voice . "" Patient delirious , nurse ? "" A quiet , grave-looking face was bent over West's pillow , and the poor fellow jumped at the idea that this must be the surgeon . "" No , sir ; no , sir ! "" he whispered excitedly , catching at the new-comer's arm . "" I am better : it is only that I am in trouble about my clothes . "" "" Clothes , eh ? "" said the doctor , smiling . "" Oh , you will not want clothes for two or three weeks yet . "" "" Not to dress , sir , "" whispered West excitedly ; "" but I must have my jacket . It is important ! "" "" Why ? "" said the surgeon , laying his hand upon the young man's brow soothingly . "" I was bringing on a despatch from Mafeking when I was shot down , sir , "" whispered West excitedly . "" It was sewn up for safety in the breast . "" "" Indeed ? "" said the doctor , laying his fingers on the lad's pulse and looking keenly in his eyes . "" Yes , sir , indeed ! "" said West eagerly . "" I know what I am saying , sir . "" "" Yes , you are cool now ; but I 'm afraid the jacket will have been burned with other garments of the kind . Of course , the contents of the pockets will have been preserved . "" "" Oh , they are nothing , sir , "" cried West piteously . "" It is a letter sewn up in the breast that I want . It is so important ! "" "" Well , I 'll see ! "" said the doctor gravely , and , signing to the nurse who had been in attendance , he left the ward , with West in a state of feverish anxiety . At last , to West's intense satisfaction , the horribly blood-stained garment was brought in , and his hand went out trembling to catch it by the breast , fully expecting to find the missive gone . "" Yes , "" he cried wildly , "" it is here ! "" "" Hah ! "" cried the doctor , and , taking out his knife , he prepared to slit it up , but West checked him . "" No , "" he panted : "" the Commandant . Send for him here ! "" "" My good lad , he is so busy , he would not come ! Let me cut out the message and send it to him . "" "" No , "" said West firmly ; "" I will not part from it till he comes . "" "" But really -- "" "" Tell him a wounded messenger from Mafeking has a letter for him , and he will come . "" West was right : the magic word Mafeking brought the Commandant to his bedside ; and as soon as he came up he stopped short and made what little blood poor West had left flush to his face , for he cried : "" Hullo ! Why , it is our illicit-diamond-dealer ! I thought we were never to see you again ! "" "" It is not true ! "" cried West . "" The man who denounced me lied ! "" "" Then you have been to Mafeking ? "" "" Yes , sir : Mr. Ingleborough and I. "" "" And brought back a despatch ? "" "" Yes , sir : here it is ! "" "" Where ? "" said the Commandant , glancing down at the stained tunic on the bed . "" Open it now , sir , "" said West to the doctor , who took out his knife again , slit the cloth , and drew out the big letter , terribly soaked with its bearer's blood . "" Bravo ! Brave messenger ! "" cried the Commandant , grasping West's hand before tearing open the packet and finding enough of the despatch unstained to allow him to decipher the principal part of the text . "" Hah ! "" he cried , when he had finished , "" on the whole good news ; but , "" he continued , glancing at the date , "" you have been a long time coming . "" "" Have I , sir ? We lost no time ! "" "" The poor fellow has been lying here for a fortnight , sir , "" said the surgeon . "" A fortnight ago ? Why , that was the day when the reconnoitring party returned with the captured sheep and cattle . Yes , I remember now : they had a brush with the Boers up the river . Of course , yes : they were attracted by the firing , and saved two young Englishmen . You are one of them ? "" "" Yes , sir . "" "" Well done , then ! Our raiding party did good work , though they did have a desperate fight afterwards to get through the Boer lines . Getting better ? "" "" Yes , sir , "" said West , with a sigh of relief : "" now that I have got my despatch safely into your hands ! "" "" But what about your bad character ? "" "" It was a false accusation , sir ! "" cried West indignantly . "" The man who denounced me was the criminal himself . "" "" Well , you have done your duty so truly that I believe you in preference to him . "" "" But I shall be able to fully clear myself , sir , soon , for this man is a prisoner now with the cavalry brigade . Has that come into the town yet , sir , with the prisoners , guns , and the convoy they captured ? "" "" Hah ! "" cried the Commandant : "" this is news indeed ! Has the brigade captured all you say ? "" "" Yes , sir , "" said West , and he told all that had taken place up to the time of he and Ingleborough being cut off and chased by the Boers . "" We knew nothing of this ! "" said the Commandant . "" We are prisoners ourselves ; but your news gives us hope of a speedy release , for the General is not one to let the grass grow under his feet . "" "" He is not , sir ! "" said West . "" Then you shall bring me and the man who accused me face to face . "" "" The sooner the better , my lad ! "" said the Commandant warmly . "" How soon will he be up , doctor ? "" "" Within a fortnight , I hope , sir ! "" was the reply . "" Then goodbye for the present , my lad ! "" said the Commandant . "" Your long-delayed despatch will send a thrill of hope through all here in Kimberley , for it breathes nothing but determination to hold the Boers at bay . "" "" May I say one word more , sir ? "" said West excitedly . "" What do you think , doctor ? "" "" He has said enough , sir , and if he talks much more we shall have the fever back . Well , perhaps he 'll fret if he does not get something off his mind . "" "" What is it , then ? "" said the Commandant . "" I had a brave comrade to ride with the despatch , sir . "" "" To be sure , yes , I remember . What about him ? Not killed , I hope ? "" "" No , sir , but badly wounded , and lying somewhere here . "" "" Poor fellow ! I must see him . There must be promotion for you both . "" "" If you would see him , sir , and speak to him as you have spoken to me , "" said West , with the weak tears rising to his eyes . "" Of course , yes ! There , shake hands , my lad : you have done splendidly ! Do n't worry about the diamond charge ! I can feel that it was a contemptible lie ! Now , doctor , take me to your other patient . "" "" Ha ! "" sighed West , nestling back on his pillow with a calm look of content in his eyes , which closed directly after for a sleep that lasted ten hours at the least . | Next chapter | | Previous chapter | | Contents | E-Books created from nineteenth century or early twentieth century texts by Athelstane E-Texts . </doc>

1163,A1,"Money as a motivator at work Does "" If you pay peanuts , you get monkeys "" principle still work ? The word "" motivation "" in this essay will be used in order to indicate the interests , desires and internal readiness of a worker to apply certain efforts , take necessary steps to satisfy the career needs that are significant for him . If there had been an opportunity to ask the company leaders , owners of different companies , HR-managers or specialists what kind of employees they want to have in their companies , the answer would have been unambiguous . All of them would be unanimous about such qualities as the ability to think and act independently , the ability to show personal initiative , take reasonable risks and ability to take responsibility for actions , professionalism , be picky to the quality of personal work and many other qualities . The question how motivated an employee should be to correspond to this list of qualities-demands and is money an effective motivator at work to make each of them to become an "" outstanding "" employee . How does a company find itself in a situation when a worker that has been chosen exactly by the company authorities starts being lazy and his work turns into a "" satisfactory "" one ? Any malfunctions during the process of employee-selection ? Could be . But what about the skill that the majority of the company leaders are proud of – the skill to chose only those with an "" eyes blazing "" ? It goes without saying that money is an "" engine "" of everything but sometimes it may not be enough to keep this "" blaze "" in the eyes of an employee . Money and motivation Managers apply a lot of effort to make the working places of their companies look attractive for professional and skillful employees . It is not enough just to pay the salary now ! Money nowadays is not a factor that can make the employee work at his full both at work and even continue working at home . It is simple as that – if a person works in a company only because of money , or is other words is money-motivated , he can be easily "" purchased "" by a rival . No existing company is interested in letting a valuable employee to work for another company , because it can inflict a considerable damage to the companies . So this is the primary reason why employers should understand that a only money-motivated employee is a potential "" vermin "" of the company . Money by itself is obviously not a sufficient motivator at work . An employee working for money only will leave work at the very minute of its end and never do anything above his "" duty regulations "" . He will never work with the company but always for it . And therefore will not see the difference between working for this or that company because it will be only the matter of the salary-issue . This is the point when the authorities of any company think with tension about the motivation of their personnel . As the matter of fact the majority of contemporary employees search other benefits from work , except their wages . Motivation of the personnel It is possible to identify four main motivational-factors . In the first place it is the "" compensational plan "" which is the collection of material goods , which are given by the company to the employee . The word compensation is the most appropriate because in exchange for these material goods , the employer expects honest labor , time and many other things from the worker . The mentioned above "" material goods "" provided by the employer includes salaries , bonuses , extra-pays and other financial encouragements . So as it may be understood from the very beginning – money is only one the four major motivational factors and therefore has a 1 ⁄ 4 impact on the motivation of the employee . The next factor that keeps the personnel motivated is the condition of their labor . To make a long story short , it goes about making the working place comfortable for the worker and making the atmosphere well disposed . The third factor influencing motivation is the possibility to achieve self-actualization , to go in for a favorite occupation , the possibility to grow personally and professionally . These possibilities ordinarily result from the investments that the company makes into its personnel , or in other words the material and other embeddings into the development of the competency and loyalty of the employees . And the fourth factor is the literal behavior of the company's management of all levels , promoting professional inspiration , conscious and productive work of the personnel . All these factors are guarantors of the protections of the company's interests , represented through the employees of the company . So the main question remains the same – how much an employee should be paid in order to make him reveal his whole professional potential ? In order to analyze the capability of money as a motivator at work it is very important to understand the existing general system of payments or in other words the existing way of the "" compensation plan "" . Money , stimuli and employers The longing for finding a compromise between the interest of the company and the interests of the employees should imply the principle of simplicity and transparency . This means , that the personal of the company has to have a clear "" picture "" of the system of payment of the company , in other words to know what actions and result should be financially encouraged and what – not . So , basically saying – money can be a good motivator if this system is clearly set and understandable to the employee . If the model of payment is too complicated , in this case it confuses both the employer and the employee , and becomes the reason of misunderstandings between them . Complicated schemes do not stimulate , but truly confuse the personnel . Each employee should feel that he is very important for the company , even if his work belong to the undermost category . These are the conditions that do make money a good motivator , but it is important to remember that it is not the only necessary motivator that will bring results at work . If the leaders of the company fail to combine all the listed above factors , they turn to the easiest and quickest , but the most unproductive way of motivation – money motivation . It may be in some way compared to negative reinforcement – brings results immediately , but in the long run causes a lot of trouble . According to Jim Clemmer , only weak leaders use money as a motivator [ 3 ] 1 . Basically saying is an employer does not want to invest into the employees in the long run and is interested in the instant , short-live result – than he may be called a weak leader focused on money as a motivator . When it comes to the motivation of the employees it is very important to understand the difference between a stimulus and a motive . Everything is rather easy . A stimulus – is an external impetus to any activity and a motive - is an internal one . So for instance , the salary – is a stimulus , but the desire to achieve a certain level of professionalism is a motive . The level of motivation strongly depends on the managers of the company . The level of motivation for every company is the statistical feature , defining in what degree the given motive is capable of influencing the respondent's choice either to do or not to do the given work . "" ... But the big problem is that managers have consistently listed money as the number one factor that they think motivates people . So they keep fiddling with pay , bonus , and financial incentives in a futile attempt to find the elusive combination that will motivate people to higher performance "" – the words of the Clemmer's article completely reveal the true situation concerning to question "" money as a motivator "" . The true "" picture "" Maslow's hierarchy of needs has already become legendary . The Journal of Extension has applied this hierarchy to the sphere of employment2 . According to Maslow's theory and the possible critical analysis what can be made on its basis of the problem of money as a motivator leads to the understanding that a worker will never reveal his full potential only because of the monetary motivation . There is a time in the life of every employee when motivation through money plays an extremely important part in his or her lives . The maximum level of the money-motivation is the age of 24-27 years and at the very end of the professional career or in other words the pre-retirement time . This happen due to the fact that in the beginning of the career a person strives to become independent financially . And during the pre-retirement age a person wants to provide a financially independent retirement . The most vital part of the information given above is that these two ages are the most sensitive periods , when money can be a sufficient motivator . So money as a motivator is productive only for a short period of time and the money-motive can not move the person onward constantly . It should be never forgotten , that thought money are vital in the contemporary world they are no the only thing that matters to people , especially when it comes to their career and such things as recognition are much valuable for each given employee in particular . Conclusion . Money is definitely now a good and certainly not the only motivator that should be used at work . A number of misunderstandings occur when it is considered as the only motivator , because the individual peculiarities of each employee are not taken into account . In order to take into account the individual peculiarities of the personnel , add flexibility and controllability to the system of money-based motivation it is necessary to constantly provide additions to the salaries , but these additions should be clear and for certain reasons that the employee need to know . So the most important is that the system of motivation needs to be absolutely transparent and understandable for the employees and it has to react at the changes in the external and the internal situation of the company . Sometimes the authorities of the company need to think first before paying an employee because may be it is the time for a "" thank your o for your outstanding work "" letter . Money is not an effective motivator , because it can not make the employee works at his full . There different types of employees . Some of them need power , some need authority , others prefer money , and another type will choose stability and many other preferences . And what is really important to remember that no money will change this needs and money by itself is not sufficient to make the person successful in his career . 1 "" ... Money always shows up as fourth or fifth on any list of motivational factors . Pay gets people to show up for work . But pay does n't get many to excel . More important is interesting , challenging , or meaningful work , recognition and appreciation , a sense of accomplishment , growth opportunities ...

1628,A11,"Received , at last , one more Judicial Review ' Refusal ' , ' on the papers ' , refused by last month's ' Breach of a Restraning Order ' trial judge , His Honour Judge Curran , on some bl == dy nonsense over whether or not a ' Restraining Order ' was ever served on me in the cells as if there was not ample contemporaneous records about ! Originating from , if true , this very ' Harassment ' issue , £ 50 fine , ' shoot to kill ' hearings and Section 39 abuse , under review in this very JR application ! So who blocks the investigation the most senior Cardiff Crown court judge ... anything to block exposure of the truth ... corruption is just rife around here or is it me with some brain disorder ? While the prosecution barrister , David Garreth Evans apolgised to the jury , for not being available as my main defence witness , he still having an early version of this now , ubiquitous ' restraining order ' in his pocket . The District Judge John Charles' Magistrates court 's , custody and cell cctv records are , meantime , quickly being shredded , re written or burnt , in fear the law , that Litigants in Person are not , as of right , entitled to public court records , may get itself repealed in Westminster .. So , if the CPS has a copy in his pocket , partly hand written by John Charles , then what is prosecution exhibit 1 , labelled ' 1st December11 Restraining Order ' , doing with the jury when it is date stamped 9th Dec ? So another version , slipped under my police door on 23rd Dec 11 , is the first one I see but different also from exhibit 1 . Very strange . Very strange , indeed , for the police did not e-mail me one , as promised , on the 19th Dec , over the phone from Llantwit police station . Oh , very odd ...... but hang on a minute that must be the one they quickly printed up following my unexpected appeal to Crown Court , in England , on the 7th Dec , no ? But I went to the magistrates court and told they had no record at all of any restraining order . But , of course , John Charles , had , in his fit of peak , scribbled out a section 4 ' restraining order ' , contrary to the Section 2 Harassment Act , currently before the court , to obtain a maximum jail term , if broken . Someone in HM Partnership , however , must have blocked it because the 8th Dec version , created on computor and ' certificate of conviction ' has omitted the ' fear of violence ' phrase on it . Stop worrying Maurice , Gareth , you will remember , told the jury he was checking up with his local bar council that all is ok and that the apparant conspiracy , witnessed by his friends in the public gallery , of CPS and Charles hatching a diversion , was going rapidly pear shaped . Muttering over court exhibits , I remember and I never saw . I heard Gareth and judge mumble , ' switch them ' and we will have him locked away . Fortunately , all was tape recorded and smuggled out of court as a procautionary matter in case the cabal are setting me up , again , to be shot by South Wales Police marksmen . All this was discussed , in detail , during the IAP and MAPPA police HQ meetings in June 2009 . Operation Orchid and Operation Chalice , re machine gun and snatching my younger daughter , were foiled but hey will get it right next time , I fear . Remember , They control the Welsh IPCC , Welsh GMC , Welsh Bar Council and their Cardiff Bay ' talking shop ' , Wales' big mistake for its best future ..... their key members are entrenched , all in the same lodge and ready to do more damage for the devil . Any way , not to worry ' justice ' is in a safe pair of hands ..... His Honour ordered Gareth to nip back up to his Crown Prosecution Service office , in Merthyr Tydfil and get the Restraining Order , serve it to me so we can all go home . But , over night , we all forget except for two on the jury . They are starting to work out the judge's cunning plan only to be thwarted , following their request for sight of the custody records that service ever took place in the cells below that chaotic December magistrates court hearing when I was refused the usual right to cross examine , call witnesses , finish my evidence , have any legal papers or even have pen and paper in my cell . "" Do not trouble your pretty heads "" , Judge Curran must have said , "" the court record of there ever being printed a ' restraining order and served , all on that day , is irrelevant to Maurice's blatent guilt "" . "" and as for the two cameras , he referred to , one in his special padded isolation cell , with £ 5000 ' see through ' door , that filmed every move of this MAPPA level 3 victim , sadly , ( pause while wiping his eyes ) , GEOamey Custody Services appear to have ' mislaid ' all the footage . "" "" It is also quite irrelevant so , hurry up on your way , its late on a Friday afternoon and I am already late , a majority verdict will do and dont worry about Maurice calling for Gareth , the doctor and another ,,,, its all far too late "" Hang on a moment , did n't this same judge insist the main witness , the doctor , give evidence for me but only through a court lawyer ? Yes , of course , his 22nd February 2012 Crown Court Order , part of my defence evidence stuffed up my rectum , in order to get it into court . Now , as I remember it , this judge also appointed a special Cardiff Cabal lawyer , under rule 39 of the Youth and Justice Criminal Evidence Act 1999 , anything to block any possiblility of evidence coming out and that I may not have ' significant brain damage ' or ' possible brain tumour ' after all . But what is this , both doctor and appointed lawyer fail to attend court ..... "" oh , what can be done ? "" "" Oh , I am all undone , I am in fear and shaking in my shoes , of the meer rumour of this last act of treachery must cause , being mis understood by Jo Public as being an unfair trial . Just what will it do to the name of Cardiff law courts ..... oh , perish the thought I wonder if Enyd Blyton could have made up this sort of stuff ? Must look into serialising these proceedings , some time , to rival some TV soap . His Honour Judge Curran has , understandably , rejected my 1 st Judicial Review Application , ' on paper ' , on the premise that it is ' not clear ' as to my reasoning behind my grievance , in being convicted of so serious offence , during my absence . The police , once again , are reliant on false forensic evidence supplied by Derrick Hassan of the Cardiff Crown Court and a doctor to obtain yet another prolonged incarceration without a proper trial . Court record will disclose that the District Judge , Bodfan Jenkins , presiding at last August Cardiff magistrates hearing , had not even been given my correspondence regarding my right , under statute law , to apply for a re opening of the case . He was also never made aware of the full circumstances on the bizarre incident , involving alleged prohibited weapons in my possession , including a ' walking stick shot gun ' , being the real reason for the summary conviction and £ 50 fine . [ This startlingly acknowledgement by the police , of finding a real prohibited weapon , contrary to Section 5 ( 1 ) ( a ) of the 1968 Fire Arms Act 1966 , at my home , right in the middle of my January 2009 ' WW1 Lewis machine gun ' trial , was completely hushed up and only surfaced before the very same District Judge , Mr Bodfan Jenkins , this March , in one of my many private prosecutions , due to someone's stupidity letting it slip through their own safety net ] . This one caused the destruction of my family life , at 8am on 22nd June 2009 , using twenty five coppers + , followed by my nearly eight months in jail as an innocent man , but who 's counting ? This one , with a rogue doctor , both on the purse strings of lots of charity cash , in South Wales ...... but that is another story to those with the bottle This one personally arranged to have me struck off as a veterinary surgeon , using countless spurious convictions from a thoroughly corrupt Cardiff judicial system ... but this is only the tip of the iceberg *** , My friends know where you live This same argument or the use of Section 36 YJCEA , anything to suppress the truth , is just what District Judge Berg , on 2 nd November 10 common assault conviction , applied when expediting it in meer nana seconds during my forced absence , due to ill health due to unnecessary analgesic medication . This appeal is now in Bristol having been transferred from Wales due to its potentially embarrassing outcome . If only a litigant in person in Cardiff could just have sight of public court records , when only reserved for the legal profession , we need not shout blackmail so often . Exposure , of course , of what really is going on in our courts , if further public records were to be disclosed to the public , would , for example , be like what happened following the prison hospital emergency , needing seventeen prison officers to extricate me . Out of the prison for a day , in cuffs , I get sight of what was written on court record , my ' Remand Warrant ' indicating clearly what lay behind the judiciary's next move . Apart from quick sight of my custody record and remnants of my exalted status amongst the inmates of a category level C parochial prison , during my 2009 stay , as MAPPA level3 , the words , ' extremely dangerous ' remained . Both court and custody documents , seen by myself , during the material times of all these JRs , currently before His Honour Judge Curran , Mr Justice Singh , record I have ' mental health issues ' clearly written with ' significant brain damage ' written . This immediately brings into doubt my level of capacity in the past three years court appearances , exceeding well over one hundred , known by the prosecution throughout . This hand written note , on the Remand Warrant , no doubt , was by the clerk of the court and / or signed by the very District Judge first implementing a Section 36 , without giving reason and then sitting in judgment . As for the so called ' served ' Restraining Order neither the original nor certified true copy we will ever see because it now helps identify the author of it and true recipient for my term of imprisonment . This 2010 ' common assault ' conviction , on appeal in Bristol , will prove even more interesting , following my most recent attempts at the steps of Cardiff Crown Court to lodge my paper , as it is so devoid of ' magistrates record ' , the recent letters from the court clerk effectively stating , ' in your dreams , Maurice ' , no records for you . So why does this latest JR refusal , ' on paper ' , accompany a copy of the Cardiff Crown court log of my 1 st / 2 nd March 2012 Harassment Appeal , when for years now I have always been refused of such public record ? If you are eligible for legal aid then , of course , your designated lawyer can see them , at tax payer's expence , for as long as he likes and even give them to you , if he so pleases . The reality of this is , of course , is quite unrealistic , if nefarious schemes are afoot as he or she is an ' officer of the court ' and therefore making it impossible to remain impartial . Statute law dictates that a ' litigant in person ' ( LiP ) may , if he is so lucky , obtain disclosure of a clerk of the court's notes , both contemporaneous and later records , such as , in this case , written record of the allegation ( s ) facing the accused . The court is only obliged to release a certificate of conviction . These next two ladies outside the RCJ have spent much of their lives , fighting for justice , mutilated by this gross injustice of failed disclosure of court documents I have received no copy of whatever was first before the August Magistrate , what was charge was changed , in my absence or copy of the CPS legal argument that went on with the court without me . This had followed the duty solicitor's hurried visit to my cell , that summer's day , advising me to plead ' not guilty ' as it had been arranged for the case to be dropped if I did . Why was so serious a charge dropped ? Because I had just served new statements , from a Lincolnshire airfield , of eye witnesses over the police re painted ' machine gun ' , spent still more hours before with the station's inspector while copious complaint was again being taken down , re the Cardiff IPPC office refusing , since 2009 , to properly investigate : 1 . the Polices policy to having me shot 2 . falsifying critical evidence in their disastrous ' machine gun ' case , painting of the ' gun ' twice , making it serviceable , all to fool a jury 3 . changing the sex of ' Foxy ' , their undercover agent , that had to give evidence 4 . their continuing harassment of me , around the UK , by the use of falsified two year old psychiatric evidence Today , as in the recent ' Restraining Order ' jury trial and their written notes to the judge , I am still without the public record of either of these cases ! Court record , regarding the Lord Mayor Cardiff to be shot , are being withheld for the purpose of my being sectioned , again , under the 1983 Mental Health Act , but this time for life . South Wales Police almost achieved it in 2009 and with co-operation from the Tottenham police , during the ' Nigerian Musa seven snatched children affair ' , in court NOW at Wood Green Crown Court , London . This time the same MAPPA police intend finding the ' elusive second doctor ' , needed by statute , to sign me away , IPP , to Broadmoor . The purpose of my JR Application is clearly in the interest of the general public , not just for my liberty , safety and family concerns . The next presiding judge , I humbly submit , is required to consider the consequences should this need to go to the Court of Appeal happen and where Article 6 and its supposed safeguards will again be challenged as being needed even more in our current political climate . My recent interviews , with my ' straw poll ' sample taken from within the walls of Cardiff Prison , proved disturbing to say the least . Invariably , both remand and convicted prisoners do not even see the paper work identifying as why they are in prison ! Yes , many neither care nor enquire ; the place is a ' holiday camp ' with no real purpose , so why rock the boat ? If I could have found another LiP , out of the hundred or so prisoners on my wing , I may have established if I was the only one , in the prison , with that special piece of paper , a ' Remand Warrant ' . It was signed by the court giving authority to allow the HM Governor to lock me up . Where His Honour and or the next judge will be concerned will rest on the veracity of those in ultimate control , the guards who guard the guardians , for without proper disclosure there will be yet another fine example of a travesty of justice in a Cardiff court room . Photo of my leaving Cardiff Magistrates , in hand cuffs , by narked South Wales Police , on 1st December 2011 , with no knowledge of any existance of a ' restraining order but beaten up by GEOamey Custodial Services just minutes before . all caught on video the judge , Mr Curran , refused to be made shown to the 4th May12 jury in Cardiff Crown Court . AGAINST CONVICTION 1 . His Honour Judge Curran ought to have recused himself from presiding over the trial of the Appellant as he had previously stayed the Appellant's application to the Cardiff Administrative Court for Judicial Review of the Appellant's appeal at Cardiff Crown Court , Case A20110290 , on 1 st March 2012 and his conviction and sentance of harassment , contrary to the Section 2 of Protection from Harassment Act 1997 , at Cardiff Magistrates Court , on 1st December 2011 , the subject of the Restraining Order allegedly breached in this present case . 2 . Whilst accepting that the issues of fact in the trial were for the jury , His Honour Judge Curran made a number of rulings that erred in law similar if not identical to those by both District Judge John Charles , at Cardiff Magistrates and his Honour Judge PD Hughes QC , in its appeal , at Cardiff Crown Court . 3 . Subsequently , failed disclosure of evidence , by way of court and custody documents and cctv footage , all under the control of the South Wales Police , caused the Appellant , in each of these court cases , compounded the reasons for refusal of access to his own legal papers in both court and prison and be given any facilities , at all , to either interview or call his own witnesses . 4 . All prosecution witnesses , in the two previous above mentioned trials , were prevented from being cross examined by the Claimant while the main witness , a doctor , in the jury trial , subject to this appeal , was denied the Claimant's required examination or cross examination , contrary to His Honour Judge Curran QC's 22 nd February 2012 Court Order . 5 . This was further compounded following , first by the failure to attend of the court instructed barrister , to cross examine the witness ( es ) ' on the Appellant's behalf ' , under Section 36 of Youth and Justice and Criminal Evidence Act 1999 and following His Honour Judge Hugh Davies QC's April 2012 Court Order that caused this main prosecution witness to be removed from the witness list , as irrelevant and so facilitate the Appellant's immediate release from prison . 6 . For the prosecution barrister , on 2 nd May 2012 , to then open the prosecution's case by stating , before the jury and the trial judge , that the South Wales Police had ' just decided ' not to now call the doctor to give evidence , was nothing short of a criminal offence . 7 . For the Appellant then not to be allowed to call this already empanelled prosecution witness , being ' anybody's property ' , as his psychiatrist , expert witness and / or witness of fact and / or as his character witness , was a further abuse . 8 . Before His Honour Judge Hugh Davies QC the prosecution had admitted it was only by the citing of this same witness , in all these three hearings , 2009 WW1Machine Gun trial and numerously related other summary hearings , by the South Wales Police , that the Crown Prosecution Service had been able to be successful , for the South Wales Police , to oppose the Appellant's preparation of both his civil and criminal cases , against the Chief Constable , out of custody , since 8am 22 nd June 2009 . 9 . By April 2012 the Appellant had almost served the pre arranged prison sentence of nine months , in any event , when bail would have been granted , by His Honour Judge Hugh Davies QC , had the Appellant been so stupidly minded as to apply . 10 . There was a "" real possibility "" of actual and / or perceived bias , as a result of His Honour Judge Curran presiding over the Appellant's trial , when the learned Judge had already stayed the Appellant's application for permission to apply for Judicial Review of the dismissal of his appeal against conviction , on 2 March 2012 , relating to the conviction in respect of which the Restraining Order , imposed by Cardiff Magistrates ' , which was alleged to have been now breached . 11 . The certificate of conviction , at last released to the Appellant by HM Court and Tribunals Service , states the 1 st or 9 th December 2011 dated Restraining Order was dependent upon the conviction for a breach in Section 2 of the said Act but Prosecution Exhibit 1 indicates the ' served order ' on the Appellant was that from a Section 4 Restraining Order dated 8 th December 2011 . 12 . His Honour's failure to conduct a ' Vue de Justice ' with the jury , following the custody officers in the both courts , employed by GEOamey Custody Services Ltd , confiscation of the Appellant's scale drawings of the Cardiff magistrates custody suite , where the alleged offence took place was an abuse in law . 13 . His Honour's failure to grant an adjournment for medical attention or even access to his medication in the cells below , following GEOamey Custody Services' vicious assaults upon the Appellant , both on 1 st December 2011 and 4 th April 2012 , was an abuse of process . 14 . His Honour's failure to allow the Appellant sight of all the prosecution exhibits , eg website blog of 4 th December 2011 on http://www.kirkflyingvet.com/ , on arrest , before caution and / or during the trial and sight of various jury ' notes ' , passed to His Honour , following the Appellant's suggestion , in the course of the trial , was also wrong in law . 15 . His Honour's failure to ever allow the Appellant sight of the original or sight of a certified true copy , of the Restraining Order , allegedly served on him , was also wrong in law . 16 . His Honour's failure to order HM Prison , Cardiff to release the Appellant's legal papers and posted in court exhibits by his Mackenzie Friend , allow him proper access to facilities , in order to conduct is defence did nothing but to compound his difficulties and were further breaches in his rights under the Rule of Law . 17 . In the alternative , at the appropriate time , His Honour failed to properly consider granting bail , out of custody , in the light of these apparent extreme and unusual circumstances , unable to find local legal representation , as was indicated by His Honour Judge Hugh Davies QC , on 7 th April 2012 , in Cardiff Crown Court and by His Honour Judge Lambert in Bristol Crown Court , during an apparent application for bail well outside South Wales . 18 . The Appellant therefore had an unfair trial and / or the said trial took place in breach of article 6 ( 1 ) of the ECHR as incorporated by schedule 1 of the Human Rights Act 1998 . 1 . Mr. David Gareth Evans of counsel ought not to have prosecuted the case against the Appellant as he was a potential prosecution or defence witness relating to the drawing up and purported ' service of a ' Restraining Order ' signed ? by District Judge Charles at Cardiff Magistrates' Court on 1 st December 2011 . 2 . An approach by the Appellant's Mackenzie Friend caused the CPS barrister to produce another version of Prosecution Exhibit One , ' Restraining Order ' , not date stamped by the court . Prosecution Exhibit One included the court date stamp 9 th Dec 2011 . 3 . The prosecution barrister admitted , before the jury , a ' draught ' Restraining Order did still exist and was ordered to produce it , by the following day , by His Honour Judge John Curran . 4 . There was discussion , quite wrongly before the jury , as to whether Mr. Evans would be called as a witness relating to the ' drawing up ' of the ' Restraining Order and he indicated to His Honour Judge Curran that he would have to "" seek advice from his professional body the Bar Council for England and Wales "" . 5 . The court heard no more so the Appellant called him as a defence witness and was refused . 6 . The Appellant was refused an adjournment in the light of late prosecution disclosure of relevant evidence germane to the original 1 st December 2011 conviction , upon which the Restraining Order relied . 7 . Further evidence to support , unavailable in the time frame available , was the ' contemporaneous note ' made by the Appellant's solicitor of his client's memory of events on the 1 st December 2011 , on 22 nd December2011 , just two days before the Appellant's arrest and subsequent incarceration . 8 . HM Cardiff prison's governors denied the Appellant proper client / solicitor / witness access , his access to his own funds for the defence or provide proper service of his letters / faxes / e-mails and telephone calls , to and from his solicitor , helpers or proposed witnesses controlled by MAPPA . 9 . An issue had therefore arisen in the case as to what documents were allegedly served on the Appellant relating to the Restraining Order and as to whether one had been served as handwritten by District Judge Charles as there had been evidence adduced before the jury by way of unsworn submissions by Mr. Evans and by sworn evidence from those in the public gallery , that the former had handed up a draft of the proposed Restraining Order to District Charles for approval and that District Charles had written comments on it in order stating he withed to make the Restraining Order stronger ( change to a Section 4 Order , ' fear of violence ' ) . 10 . There was a "" real possibility "" of actual and / or perceived bias as a result of Mr. Evans prosecuting the case , when he had made oral submissions to His Honour Judge Curran which were in effect the giving of evidence which was unsworn and in respect of which the Appellant was unable to challenge by way of cross-examine . 11 . In fact the Appellant had been absent in the cells at Cardiff Magistrates' Court when the issue of the ' Restraining Order ' had been discussed by Mr. Evans with District Judge Charles on 1 st December 2011 . 12 . In addition , the relevant exchanges between Mr. Evans as prosecutor and His Honour Judge Curran were heard in the presence of the jury when they should have been ordered to retire , causing prejudice and bias in the Appellant's case . The jury specifically asked for sight of the original , not copy , of both the GEOamey Custodial Services custody and clerk of the court's log and contemporaneous notes of evidence but the judge indicated , in the absence of the Appellant , that they were not relevant . LACK OF DISCLOSURE IN RESPECT OF THE APPELLANT 1 . The prosecution failed to supply to the Appellant the complete log with handwritten notes and annotations of the custody records and cctv footage , kept by GEOamey Custodial Services , that had been in charge of security in the cells at Cardiff Magistrates' Court and also the notes made by Mr. Michael Williams , the Clerk of the Court and others at Cardiff Magistrates' Court . 2 . Further , it emerged on 3 May 2012 , during the trial that Mr. Evans was appearing in for the prosecution , he had handed up a draft of the ' Restraining Order ' to District Judge Charles on 1 st December 2011 and the learned District Judge had made handwritten additions to it with suggestions for making it stronger to be one under Section 4 of the Act . 3 . There was an issue in the trial as to exactly which version of the ' Restraining Order ' had actually been served on the Appellant in the cells by the Security Officer Mr. Leigh Barker and so the existence of the copy of the ' Restraining Order ' with the handwritten additions made by District Judge Charles became an issue as the Appellant wished the jury to see it . 4 . At the conclusion of the proceedings , on 3 May 2012 , His Honour Judge Curran enquired as to the whereabouts of the version of the Restraining Order with the handwritten additional made by District Judge Charles and was told by Mr. Evans that it was at the CPS Headquarters in the Appellant's case file at Merthyr Tydfil . 5 . Although His Honour Judge Curran directed that it be produced at the resumption of the proceedings , on 4 May 2012 , only a computer print out of the amended restraining Order was produced and the jury was deprived of seeing either the original version with the handwritten additions , made by District Judge Charles or a certified true copy of the original 1 st December 2011 Restraining Order made on some date between 1 st and 9 th December 2011 . 6 . The Appellant had also again sought disclosure of the notes made by Mr. Michael Williams , the Clerk of the Court at Cardiff Magistrates' Court at the commencement of the proceedings , on 4 May 2012 but no order or any determination was made by His Honour Judge Curran for their production , instead , in the absence of the Appellant , informing the jury they , along with the prison and GEOmey Custodial Services records were not relevant . 7 . Prior to trial His Honour knew the Appellant had received correspondence from Cardiff Magistrates stating he was not entitled to any court record other than the certificate of conviction for this and some currently seven ongoing summary cases , different but all related to this current appeal . CASE SHOULD HAVE BEEN WITHDRAWN FROM CONSIDERATION BY THE JURY 1 . Although the Appellant did n't make any submissions of ' no case to answer ' , after the close of the prosecution's case , His Honour Judge Curran should have withdrawn the case from the jury on the grounds that the evidence as it then stood , relating to the alleged service of the Restraining Order on the Appellant in the cell number three of Cardiff Magistrates' Court , on 1 st December 2011 , was so unreliable that no jury properly directed could convict on that evidence . 2 . Conflicting evidence had been given between the Clerk of the Court , Mr. Michael Williams and the Security Officer , Mr. Leigh Barker as to whether the Appellant had been serviced in one of the cells or in the corridor of the cell area below the Magistrates , whether he had been served with one or two separate documents , if at all and when put alongside their original but conflicting police witness statements , it is the Appellant's submission , that for this case to have even reached a jury was an abuse of process fueled by vengeance . 3 . In addition , Mr. Barker had given evidence that he had read "" Restraining Order "" at the top of the document , that he had stated in evidence he had given to the Appellant but did n't give any evidence that the Appellant's name was on the document or that he had read the Appellant's name on the document in question . 4 . There was a serious risk of doubt regarding the alleged service of the ' Restraining Order ' on the Appellant in the cell area of Cardiff Magistrates' Court by Mr. Barker on the Appellant . 5 . In the premises , the Appellant's conviction is thereby rendered "" unsafe "" under section 2 ( 1 ) ( a ) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1968 . South Wales Police are currently in the lime light , following the Swansea police corruption trial and numerous other revelations so it is of no surprise the St Mellons , Cardiff base of the IPCC have put both multiple complaints from me and my family on the back burner . In the light of my complaints , since 2009 , to the IPCC and my long terms remanded in custody , with little or no activity so far identified on your part , in these investigations , I wondered if I might ask you to clarify as to just what progress , if at all , has been so far occasioned in this scandalous affair . I have now obtained copy from the Crown Prosecution Service ( Cardiff ) , with a witness actually writing the colour was ' silver ' and yet this was never raised at the trial . Why not ? How do you account for that or is this a matter of complaint to ' HM Partnership ' and Her Majesty's Prerogative ? Just who , in the Principality , guards the guardian ? I intend going to High Grove with yet another letter of complaint . http://kirkflyingvet.com/photos/around_the_world/HRH-Undelivered-Letter.aspx I returned to Wickenby , Lincolnshire airfield , last week only to find no investigation started , no witness contacted , more eye witnesses found to the fact that the ' gun ' was bought from me as painted black all over . When seized by the police , a year later , it was now with a silver painted ammunition magazine . You refuse to return a copy of my statement or a walking stick shot gun found in the search of my home . In August 2009 South Wales Police , three of them , then returned to Wickenby , with it , less magazine , for further prosecution statements . Police had unblocked it to fire a live round , but admitted obtaining a statement that witnesses saw it painted silver by the new owner immediately after purchase from me . The ' gun ' next appeared in my January 2010 Cardiff Crown Court trial painted ' all black , ' to match the photos and videos off my 2008 website , http://www.kirkflyingvet.com/ even with its ammunition clearly visible ! My younger daughter helped me draw out a route of some 2000 miles the gun may have travelled , during your colleagues' planned conspiracy to pervert the course of justice but there remain gaps , as the jury noticed , of just who , when and where this item went , whilst inside the boundaries of South Wales ? The ' gun ' was returned after my acquittal , painted silver again , not even in matching paint ? How ? Inspector 317 of the Lincolnshire police expressed amazement that this enquiry is not being conducted by way of a ' managed ' IPCC investigation from head office , in Manchester , England , instead of some back street office in Cardiff and under your control , a fellow member of South Wales Police force . This was the continuing saga on how the HM Court Service ( Wales ) , over these past twenty years , are determined to block my appeals , in either civil or criminal proceedings , from ever being aired in an English court room . In this particular case , before Bristol Crown , was , you may think , the simple delivery of appeal documents at Cardiff Crown Court over a ' Contempt of Court ' conviction , now two years ago , my having already served its prison sentence . Procedure dictated that it was to be forwarded by Cardiff Crown Court to the Criminal Court of Appeal , in the Royal Courts of Justice , London . It was a dispute over Cardiff's Recorder , His Honour Judge Nicholas Cooke QC and his pointless Court Order in that it would ' obtain ' the medical evidence I so needed in order to stop severe pain by getting a long overdue total hip replacement operation . Well , today , the appeal against ' common assault conviction ' was adjourned , in order I find a ' defence lawyer ' . If that failed it was for HM Partnership , including the worried Cardiff Crown Court staff , to apply for a Section 36 and so chose one of their own to be ' cross examined ' by ! Incestuous is n't it when you think that this very same Cardiff court officer , who had originally refused to accept my Criminal Court of Appeal papers , by pushing me down the stairs , causing the re breaking of my leg , may also now be protected , again , from my long awaited cross examination should this English court also succumb to contagion or infection . This is a further indictment of the true state of our legal system , in Wales , with the English judge noting the alleged ' common assault ' , on appeal , was committed as far back as July 2009 . The conviction was obtained by trickery , in my absence , in November 2010 and was only finally completed in December 2011 , by District Judge John Charles having milked its consequences to extreme , with a ' no penalty ' . Easy , by ' carte blanche ' application of Section 36 of the Youth and Justice Criminal Evidence Act 1999 , in order to protect their ' Cardiff Cabal ' and their ' gravy train ' , anything to stop the basic right of a defendant cross examining the prosecution witnesses to obtain the truth . By August 2010 District Judge John Charles openly started this , their latest scam of denying all witnesses . It had been implemented , quietly , for many years on LiPs in Wales and spectacularly , of late , applied part way through the January 2010 ' WW1 machine gun ' trial , with the jury's mind made up by the end of the first day . Judge Nicholas Cooke QC , that June , during the ' Contempt of Court ' debacle , had also denied me eye witnesses , access to my own medical records , anything to black mail me to employ one of their own . By Charles instructing a lawyer from Newport to cross examine , using nana seconds of court time , he obtained the criminal conviction they all wanted . Well , not quite as it sounds , maybe , as I was not even there but Ihad been excused by court order , later backed by still more specialist medical reports , from both France and England . The Newport lawyer did attend but cross examined no one , as was the case with the District Judge . Wow , they thought , what a great new way to stitch up Maurice from now on ! By September 2011 Charles had applied this 2 nd November 2010 summary conviction to lock me up for three months , pending still further conspiracies by South Wales Police , anything to prejudice my long outstanding civil damages claims . Incidentally , this District Judge stated I had failed to attend that previous year's hearing there by compounding yet another conviction , one of failure to attend ' he preferring to ignore his original reasoning for a Section 36 . A conveniently placed ' Harassment ' conviction , on the old theme , was again under his control , carrying the statutory sentence of 18 weeks , by statute , again equal to my remand time to the day of conviction . Oh how convenient . So who was surprised in that after the barrister , David Gareth Evans , had slipped in , at the very last moment , the needed extra ' posted letter ' incident to comply with statute to obtain a prison term in the first place ! My throwing this 7 th allegation , served on the day of trial , on the floor of the court had its desired effect . It was noted in the official court record and even The Glamorgan Gem newspaper , for the already drafted appeal . And abuse of Section 35 in this next case ? Yes , you guessed it ; Charles refused me any cross examination again but this time by employing a lawyer from Swansea not forgetting , this time , the man was only answerable to the court and NOT to the Defendant . He was therefore ordered to at least ' go through the motions ' of ' cross examining ' . He asked both irrelevant questions and avoided the obvious ones . He , in fact , challenged no prosecution evidence what so ever , clearly caught on tape , the transcript of which is being published later . This lawyer was last seen running , with his quick £ 1 , 200 attendance fee tucked in his belt , for his Swansea train knowing , full well , much more was due now he had proved his allegiance . Ah , no , I forget . He did come back , did n't he ? Back to repeat the performance at the March 2012 Crown Court hearing , for my appeal before His Honour Judge PD Hughes QC . Again I was denied legal papers , witnesses etc. 2011 Christmas Eve was marked by my being jailed yet again , on the old theme , this time until mid May 2012 , for an alleged ' Breach of a Restraining Order ' never served on me until pushed under a police cell door after my arrest . A nine month prison sentence had been arranged , this time , well in advance , with the usual release from custody to be on the predicted last day of trial . Continuing this Section 36 abuse , however , was to be varied and worked on with much aplomb , as this next case had a lay jury with which to contend . A most unpredictable ' creature ' in this day and age of fast changing habits and social standards . Basing the prosecution's usual strategy , on the general public's apparent fear of those employed in any court building , the judge and prosecution barrister arranged , therefore , the production only of court officials and policemen to give relevant evidence to obtain a conviction . This jury and others , no doubt , risk the huge assumption that court clerks and custody officers , as employees from within a court building are to be trusted . Having stupidly replaced properly trained prison officers to do the job we now have too many ' bully boys ' with little training , little regard for the seriousness of their work that that seriously influence proceedings . It may well have been the reason for the jury's majority verdict . That was a foregone conclusion , to me , once I was allowed no legal papers in court or facilities to interview my witnesses . My websites may well give world wide exposure on just how Cardiff 's so called ' great and the good ' continue to conspire to pervert the course of justice but while the police or judges continue to closing them down others will follow . Soon , I warn you , we will be far too many to jail at any one time . A sample of what the jury may not have known about this case ( to be later expanded in links etc ) . Much needed reforms , anticipated in our judicial system , need to be considered alongside the following : I was again to be blocked from cross examining their key prosecution witness , by application of Section 36 YJCEA 1999 but allowed , at last , to cross examine others . So what is this evil lot up to this time ? The surprising CPS barrister's opening speech , late removal of a key witness and frank admission he , as Her Majesty's Crown Court representative , should not be conducting the case , he being called as a defence witness , was but part of this pitiful story . The Section 36 ' court appointed lawyer ' , to ' cross examine ' , had failed to attend despite a string of albeit clandestine but publicly recorded Crown and Cardiff Magistrate Court hearings and Orders on the matter . One was amongst the defence evidence gently secreted just anterior to my anterior anal sphincter , ready for disclosure , hopefully from a great height . HM Cardiff prison , GEOamey Custody Services and His Honour Judge John Curran QC , had refused either my legal papers or medication being in the court . To a casual observer in the public gallery , for what was the usually concocted Cardiff cabal conspiracy , this now having the potential of something similar to a Whitehall Theatre farce . For the jury to be refused , despite asking by ' jury notes ' , to see what record both court and custody services are kept , of a service of a court document , I have all seen before . So what other exhibits would the jury ' not be allowed to examine ' if I bothered to give evidence , called witnesses and obtained the cctv ? Court cases are usually won or lost , in Cardiff , based on who has the most deceitful lawyer on their side . Successful withholding of evidence , failed ' disclosure ' , is the name of the game . The veracity and mental state of presiding judge , prosecutor and or South Wales Police invariably influences the final outcome . To even contemplate prosecuting Cardiff's court , prison or police services , for civil damages , a jury trial , for example , has to first ' collapse ' , be ' withdrawn part heard ' by the CPS ' or ' be stopped ' by the presiding judge . Above all , the Defendant must never , except in rare occasion , call defence evidence if he thinks he , his family or even his long suffering friends in the public gallery , will ever get reimbursed , following acquittal , of even their bus fares . CPS barrister David Gareth Evans to then go on and admit that , yes , I had been handed a piece of paper in my cell , on 1 st December 2011 , by their star lying witness , Geoamey Custody Services manager , Leigh Barker and yes , containing District Judge John Charles ' very own ink from his fountain pen scribbled through three lines of CPS type , should of also of stopped this trial ' dead in its tracks ' . Approx copy of notes taken by Defendant's solicitor before jury trial Restraining Order - Not in Court CPS came into cell - handwritten an ( d ) print 2 / 3 lines . Refused to leave prison until given something in writing - and was then out . Went to Court and asked for copy of what convicted for . Also contacted Crown - who had file . Inc. "" derogatory "" The CPS barrister then went on to admit , Oh yes , that piece of scribbled on paper was initially sent down for Mr Kirk's ' approval ' , to draught an order and that it had been ' left behind ' in his Merthyr Tydfil office . This was all sparked off in court by my McKenzie Friend , Mr Merion Bowen , forcing the CPS to even disclose still further yet undisclosed documents ! These other drafts were uncovered in the face of the court and still the judge did not stop the trial knowing , full well , I had written for them many weeks before . If that was not enough , to stop proceedings , this issue was compounded , yet again , by the judge now actually pretending to order the disclosure of ' District Judge John Charles' hand written note to me , a small matter I had been asking for , for months , along with the overhead cctv , capturing the lot , with both custody and court contemporaneous record that MUST GO BEFORE THE JURY . Even the visiting solicitor to the prison , before the jury trial took place , took contemporaneous note of all this gross irregularity and e-mailed me his typed record . His quiet ' negotiations ' with CPS have , so far , failed to materialise the sensible way forward for all involved . Further ' Grounds of Appeal ' papers , to the London , must go via Cardiff court within the next few days . But I have to personally deliver them to Cardiff Crown Court , possibly to Derrick Hassan again ! Consider , please , the extreme lengths to which I , one of many , have again been subjected , just to obtain both court and custody contemporaneous record for an already bemused jury . Then consider the reason for recent hunger strike , due to the appalling lack of medical services by HMP and NHS ( Wales ) , as original medical records , originally falsified for MAPPA and a string of Cardiff judges to get me IPP , in 2009 , have still not been corrected nor clarified . How many times has my lawyer written to the authorities now ? Five times ? The need to stuff defence exhibits up orifices , just to get them into court and again be subjected to being beaten up in the Cardiff prison , by the very same bully boys , 395 Myers and 344 Graham , upon my return from court , is all part of their 20 year conspiracy . Masonic devil worship ? Of course it all is while those in ' authority ' , able to stamp it out , are , of course , in the very same club . All this is exactly as to what happened in the 2009 ' machine gun ' , MAPPA and 20011 ' harassment ' court cases , all displaying extreme examples of criminal conduct by the very same faceless individuals from within the Welsh Authorities protected by HM . Extended terms of custody , each time , expecting their irritation will eventually go away , has been a particularly bad error on their part and something they are , shortly , to regret . The prison , now , will not release my legal papers needed for my appeal and JR Application to the Royal Courts of Justice . His Honour Judge Lambert , in Bristol Crown Court this , week , has ordered proper disclosure to show why the 2 nd Nov 2010 ' common assault ' conviction , at last on appeal , is listed outside Wales ? Why in my absence I was convicted of failing to attend when John Charles gave the permission ? Can this English judge also influence a Welsh prison , I wonder ? I will write to Bristol Crown Court and apply for an Order to amend the never seen yet original ' Restraining Order ' to allow me to communicate with witnesses from the public gallery for grounds for Royal Courts of Justice . When I do get promise of court records HM prison Cardiff , Geo Amy Custody Services or some Cardiff judge simply reverse their previous decisions and block their release . This time all three blocked their release after the trial had started . Judge Cullen QC repeatedly witheld what he knew , stifling evidence what the jury needed and even before the trial started , promised me both legal representation and production of the essential witness with his relevant NHS documents . The judge had no intention what so ever of ever upholding those previous court orders and ran Janet Kirk and other helpers a merry dance when they tried to get hard copy from the public counter . He knew that had the JR been successful , I was refused court documents , witnesses , access to lawyer , my own legal papers or right to cross examine in both courts . If current IPCC and NHS ' investigations ' from England had been allowed to be concluded , properly , there would not have been any trial in the first place . NHS officials or their legal representatives , crowded into each and every court room during these past seven months to monitor proceedings ........ so what are they frightenend of ? In Cardiff Crown Court , incidentally , I never ever did get to see any certified true copy of an original document relied on by the prosecution . What utter nonsense again , the ' machine gun ' case all over again . David Gareth Evans , barrister for the Crown Prosecution Service , meaning the representative of Her Majesty the Queen , was no better as he also was promised immunity to criminal prosecution as part of HM Partnership . Now , he perverted the course of justice ' big time ' knowing he is cocooned in their cosy ' Cardiff Law ' . He was free to re draft as many versions of allegations , he liked , during the magistrates nonsense and in full view of the K Team , created the very exhibit that made him , of course , the vital witness to scrap the trial . Instead , the one of many draughts , the one I only saw , was left in the CPS Merthyr Tydfil Office , under lock and key . District Judge John Charles blocked my being able to cross examine anyone , at all , as far back as August 2010 . He had taken a leaf from His Honour Judge Paul Thomas QC's book , during the scandalous 2010 ' machine gun case ' , to prevent the uncovering of the south Wales Police's MAPPA conspiracy Barrister Evans told the court he had contacted the Bar Council for help when realising I was obviously calling him as my main defence witness . As the original fabricator of some fictitiously served up paperwork , down in the cells and by post , what was he doing now conducting the prosecution in the first place . The judge , mean time , sat very quiet knowing if I had objected a re trial would have me returned to prison for many more months whilst unconvicted . On the 3rd day of this circus , Geo Amy either refused to inform the judge the CPS Evans was my defence witness , now to be called , as His Honour had already blocked all others or maybe , custody staff , Diane or Jackie did get my message to court from the cells , below ? This continuing NHS ( Wales ) withholding of my medical records , with evidence recorded of ' significant brain damage ' and a possible tumour , whilst at the same time , refusing me clarification , correction or giving me treatment , is a stark warning to others that these recent criminal proceedings , in Cardiff , have now set a precedent across the UK . 1 . Police found a walking stick shot gun , contrary to Section 5 of the 1968 Fire Arms Act and machine gun ammunition , but never mentioned it in the ' 2010 machine gun court case ' now . I wonder why ? 2 . Serious assault by Geo Amy and nothing is done about it .... see ' gallery ' . 3 . David Gareth Evans , CPS barrister , performs the classic fraudulent manoevre , had it not been done in a Cardiff court , on a par with his predecessor , CPS barrister , Richard Tohmlow , who , in 2009 , had tried to get me sectioned to Ashworth , for life . THANK YOU , FRIENDS and HELPERS WORLDWIDE ! I now risk being either jailed again or quietly eliminated , anything to stop my further exposing the wickedness within the South Wales Police and Cardiff's judiciary . I 've actually seen it in the Royal Courts of Justice , too : the Judge allows for contact with the prisoner , but the staff "" looking after "" the prisoner follow somebody else 's rule . Yesterday , the judge allowed the supporters to visit Maurice in the cells . But when they arrived there , they were told that he had already left which , unfortunately , was not true ! ... Go figure : innocent until proven guilty , fair trial or "" Cardiff Law "" : make it up as you go , as long as Maurice is treated as badly as possibly possible - by virtually anybody who has the capacity to abuse their power ... Thank you for your email of 17 March asking for information about prison conditions for litigants . As your request does not fall within the terms of the Freedom of Information Act it has been dealt with it as a Treat Official enquiry and as such I have responded accordingly . I have answered each of your questions below in he order they appear : 1 . With regard the position / recognition of McKenzie friends and the Prison Service , there is no individual or specific Prison Service Order ( PSO ) or Prison Service Instruction ( PSI ) which covers this particular subject but if in connection to an adjudication guidance can be found in the Prison Discipline Procedures PSI – PSI 47 / 2011 at paragraphs 2.10 t o 2.15 under Tarrant Principles . If the matter does relate to an adjudication , the guidance states that at the start of every hearing , the adjudicator must ask the prisoner whether s / he wishes to have additional assistance and , if the prisoner expresses interest , must explain about the possibilities of legal representation , legal advice , or of assistance from a friend or adviser , also known as a McKenzie friend . Requests for legal representation , legal advice or a McKenzie friend may also be made during the adjudication . McKenzie friends may ask for arrangements to be made before the hearing for access to various facilities in order to help the accused prepare the case . However , and as may be apparent from the above , a McKenzie friend can not act as a legal representative in the same way as an appointed solicitor or barrister and therefore they do not attract the special privileges of things such as Rule 39 or legal visits . This means that in terms of visiting arrangements the format would be a matter for local discretion and in relation to documentation passed between the prisoner and their McKenzie friend these would not attract the confidential privilege attached to Rule 39 unless they had originated from a solicitor or barrister or the Courts . 2 . The decision to use the services of Emailaprisoner.com is at the sole discretion of individual Governors / Directors and there is no central directive from NOMS Headquarters that it should be made available across the prison estate . 3 . While it is perceived that the cost of prisoners' calls is relatively high this must be reflected in the fact that the telephone system ( PINphone system ) available to prisoners is viewed as a "" private network "" and the cost of calls are not currently linked to public call rates . This is because the public payphone service does not require the same level of investment as the prison PINphone system which must operate safely and securely within the prison setting . Furthermore , to reduce costs under the current contract would require a large subsidy at public expense . The PINphone system is a unique service designed to ensure safe and secure access to telephones for prisoners . 4 . Postal orders are not the only way in which monies can be sent into prisoners . NOMS policy is set out in Paragraph 15.10.2 of Prison Service Instruction 26 / 2011 , NOMS Finance Manual , this recommends that monies sent in by post should be by cheque or postal order to safeguard the sender and the recipient , but establishments can not refuse to accept cash . 5 . Litigant in Persons who are on remand are not afforded any different provisions with regard the PINphone system as convicted prisoners . However , where there are any urgent legal or compassionate circumstances , such as imminent court proceedings or a domestic crisis , Governors / Directors have the discretion to allow such calls to take place at public expense . Before agreeing to such , it must be confirmed that this need could not be met by means of a visit or letter and that the individual had insufficient credit within their PINphone account to make the call . As stated these calls will be made at public expense and such calls can be made either via an official telephone or a generic PINphone account with pre-funded credit paid for by public funds . Furthermore , while the PINphone system does not accept incoming calls , arrangements can be made to allow prisoners to exceptionally receive calls on official telephones from official bodies or the Courts . However , this would again be at the Governors discretion . Unconvicted prisoners are statutorily entitled to send two free letters every week and the cost of postage will be paid for by the local prison ( normally sent at the 2nd Class rate of postage ) . They are also entitled to a Special Letter on top of their statutory entitlement if in exceptional circumstances and this would include in connection with their defence . They can send as many privilege letters ( ones which are paid for by the prisoner ) as they wish and are allowed to send over and above their statutory entitlement of letters . The policy which covers the above guidance can be found in PSI 49 / 2011 Prisoner Communications Services . 6 . Prisoners who demonstrate that without IT there is a real risk of prejudice to their legal proceedings are issued with IT . The Governor / Director must be convinced that the prisoner's access to justice will genuinely be hampered without appropriate IT . The overriding purpose is not to provide equipment simply to make the manipulation of material easier or to facilitate swifter communications , but to prevent the impediment of access to legal documentation that might otherwise result if the equipment is not made available . For example , a piece of prosecution evidence might only be available in digital format or be so unwieldy in paper format as to be impractical and it might therefore disadvantage the prisoner if the necessary facilities were not provided . Ideally , the prisoner's solicitor would make arrangements to bring such a piece of evidence to a legal visit to enable the client to view it and then take it away again , although if the prisoner is conducting their own defence it does not follow that IT must be provided for the duration of the case - it might only be needed to view that one piece of evidence and so should be withdrawn as soon as is practicable afterwards . Governors / Directors must balance the prisoner's need against the serious threat that IT presents to security in prisons and where access is permitted must ensure that there are procedures and technical fixes in place to prevent misuse such as illicit access to the internet and the downloading / sharing of material that might endanger or cause distress to the public , staff and other prisoners , or otherwise undermine confidence in National Offender Management Service / Ministry of Justice . </doc>

1249,A1,"Raising international regulatory standards and improving international cooperation . Washington Wire , a Wall Street Journal political blog , provides a bullet-pointed breakdown of the key points included in the document . For example , the proposal's strategies for regulating financial firms include , among others : According to Matt Kelly , the Editor-in-Chief of Compliance Week , Obama's regulatory reform proposal raises as many questions as it provides answers and may not change life for compliance officers at financial firms as much as one might think : Second , not much has changed for those compliance officers who are in the financial sector , either : they still face too many voices in the regulatory realm , talking past each other and investors , sending conflicting messages about what financial firms are supposed to do . To my thinking , the Administration's proposed reforms fall somewhere between a missed opportunity and a mixed bag of under-developed ideas . Some seem sensible . Others seem to fly in the face of political reality . Most seem to have the potential to do good , but are in such an embryonic state that they could evolve into considerable new burdens or risks for corporations – financial and non-financial alike – by the time Washington is done fiddling with them . </doc>

896,A4,"An Improvement on Jacob's Ladder In the morning of the day after that on which I swore my oath against the Six , I gave certain orders , and then rested in greater contentment than I had known for some time . I was at work ; and work , though it can not cure love , is yet a narcotic to it ; so that Sapt , who grew feverish , marvelled to see me sprawling in an armchair in the sunshine , listening to one of my friends who sang me amorous songs in a mellow voice and induced in me a pleasing melancholy . Thus was I engaged when young Rupert Hentzau , who feared neither man nor devil , and rode through the demesne – where every tree might hide a marksman , for all he knew – as though it had been the park at Strelsau , cantered up to where I lay , bowing with burlesque deference , and craving private speech with me in order to deliver a message from the Duke of Strelsau . I made all withdraw , and then he said , seating himself by me : "" The King is in love , it seems ? "" "" Not with life , my lord , "" said I , smiling . "" It is well , "" he rejoined . "" Come , we are alone , Rassendyll – "" I rose to a sitting posture . "" What 's the matter ? "" he asked . "" I was about to call one of my gentlemen to bring your horse , my lord . If you do not know how to address the King , my brother must find another messenger . "" "" Why keep up the farce ? "" he asked , negligently dusting his boot with his glove . "" Because it is not finished yet ; and meanwhile I 'll choose my own name . "" "" Oh , so be it ! Yet I spoke in love for you ; for indeed you are a man after my own heart . "" "" Saving my poor honesty , "" said I , "" maybe I am . But that I keep faith with men , and honour with women , maybe I am , my lord . "" He darted a glance at me – a glance of anger . "" Is your mother dead ? "" said I. "" Ay , she 's dead . "" "" She may thank God , "" said I , and I heard him curse me softly . "" Well , what 's the message ? "" I continued . I had touched him on the raw , for all the world knew he had broken his mother's heart and flaunted his mistresses in her house ; and his airy manner was gone for the moment . "" The duke offers you more than I would , "" he growled . "" A halter for you , sire , was my suggestion . But he offers you safe-conduct across the frontier and a million crowns . "" "" I prefer your offer , my lord , if I am bound to one . "" "" You refuse ? "" "" Of course . "" "" I told Michael you would ; "" and the villain , his temper restored , gave me the sunniest of smiles . "" The fact is , between ourselves , "" he continued , "" Michael does n't understand a gentleman . "" I began to laugh . "" And you ? "" I asked . "" I do , "" he said . "" Well , well , the halter be it . "" "" I 'm sorry you wo n't live to see it , "" I observed . "" Has his Majesty done me the honour to fasten a particular quarrel on me ? "" "" I would you were a few years older , though . "" "" Oh , God gives years , but the devil gives increase , "" laughed he . "" I can hold my own . "" "" How is your prisoner ? "" I asked . "" The K – ? "" "" Your prisoner . "" "" I forgot your wishes , sire . Well , he is alive . "" He rose to his feet ; I imitated him . Then , with a smile , he said : "" And the pretty princess ? Faith , I 'll wager the next Elphberg will be red enough , for all that Black Michael will be called his father . "" I sprang a step towards him , clenching my hand . He did not move an inch , and his lip curled in insolent amusement . "" Go , while your skin's whole ! "" I muttered . He had repaid me with interest my hit about his mother . Then came the most audacious thing I have known in my life . My friends were some thirty yards away . Rupert called to a groom to bring him his horse , and dismissed the fellow with a crown . The horse stood near . I stood still , suspecting nothing . Rupert made as though to mount ; then he suddenly turned to me : his left hand resting in his belt , his right outstretched : "" Shake hands , "" he said . I bowed , and did as he had foreseen – I put my hands behind me . Quicker than thought , his left hand darted out at me , and a small dagger flashed in the air ; he struck me in the left shoulder – had I not swerved , it had been my heart . With a cry , I staggered back . Without touching the stirrup , he leapt upon his horse and was off like an arrow , pursued by cries and revolver shots – the last as useless as the first – and I sank into my chair , bleeding profusely , as I watched the devil's brat disappear down the long avenue . My friends surrounded me , and then I fainted . I suppose that I was put to bed , and there lay , unconscious , or half conscious , for many hours ; for it was night when I awoke to my full mind , and found Fritz beside me . I was weak and weary , but he bade me be of good cheer , saying that my wound would soon heal , and that meanwhile all had gone well , for Johann , the keeper , had fallen into the snare we had laid for him , and was even now in the house . "" And the queer thing is , "" pursued Fritz , "" that I fancy he 's not altogether sorry to find himself here . He seems to think that when Black Michael has brought off his coup , witnesses of how it was effected – saving , of course , the Six themselves – will not be at a premium . "" This idea argued a shrewdness in our captive which led me to build hopes on his assistance . I ordered him to be brought in at once . Sapt conducted him , and set him in a chair by my bedside . He was sullen , and afraid ; but , to say truth , after young Rupert's exploit , we also had our fears , and , if he got as far as possible from Sapt's formidable six-shooter , Sapt kept him as far as he could from me . Moreover , when he came in his hands were bound , but that I would not suffer . I need not stay to recount the safeguards and rewards we promised the fellow – all of which were honourably observed and paid , so that he lives now in prosperity ( though where I may not mention ) ; and we were the more free inasmuch as we soon learnt that he was rather a weak man than a wicked , and had acted throughout this matter more from fear of the duke and of his own brother Max than for any love of what was done . But he had persuaded all of his loyalty ; and though not in their secret counsels , was yet , by his knowledge of their dispositions within the Castle , able to lay bare before us the very heart of their devices . And here , in brief , is his story : Below the level of the ground in the Castle , approached by a flight of stone steps which abutted on the end of the drawbridge , were situated two small rooms , cut out of the rock itself . The outer of the two had no windows , but was always lighted with candles ; the inner had one square window , which gave upon the moat . In the outer room there lay always , day and night , three of the Six ; and the instructions of Duke Michael were , that on any attack being made on the outer room , the three were to defend the door of it so long as they could without risk to themselves . But , so soon as the door should be in danger of being forced , then Rupert Hentzau or Detchard ( for one of these two was always there ) should leave the others to hold it as long as they could , and himself pass into the inner room , and , without more ado , kill the King who lay there , well-treated indeed , but without weapons , and with his arms confined in fine steel chains , which did not allow him to move his elbow more than three inches from his side . Thus , before the outer door were stormed , the King would be dead . And his body ? For his body would be evidence as damning as himself . "" Nay , sir , "" said Johann , "" his Highness has thought of that . While the two hold the outer room , the one who has killed the King unlocks the bars in the square window ( they turn on a hinge ) . The window now gives no light , for its mouth is choked by a great pipe of earthenware ; and this pipe , which is large enough to let pass through it the body of a man , passes into the moat , coming to an end immediately above the surface of the water , so that there is no perceptible interval between water and pipe . The King being dead , his murderer swiftly ties a weight to the body , and , dragging it to the window , raises it by a pulley ( for , lest the weight should prove too great , Detchard has provided one ) till it is level with the mouth of the pipe . He inserts the feet in the pipe , and pushes the body down . Silently , without splash or sound , it falls into the water and thence to the bottom of the moat , which is twenty feet deep thereabouts . This done , the murderer cries loudly , "" All 's well ! "" and himself slides down the pipe ; and the others , if they can and the attack is not too hot , run to the inner room and , seeking a moment's delay , bar the door , and in their turn slide down . And though the King rises not from the bottom , they rise and swim round to the other side , where the orders are for men to wait them with ropes , to haul them out , and horses . And here , if things go ill , the duke will join them and seek safety by riding ; but if all goes well , they will return to the Castle , and have their enemies in a trap . That , sir , is the plan of his Highness for the disposal of the King in case of need . But it is not to be used till the last ; for , as we all know , he is not minded to kill the King unless he can , before or soon after , kill you also , sir . Now , sir , I have spoken the truth , as God is my witness , and I pray you to shield me from the vengeance of Duke Michael ; for if , after he knows what I have done , I fall into his hands , I shall pray for one thing out of all the world – a speedy death , and that I shall not obtain from him ! "" The fellow's story was rudely told , but our questions supplemented his narrative . What he had told us applied to an armed attack ; but if suspicions were aroused , and there came overwhelming force – such , for instance , as I , the King , could bring – the idea of resistance would be abandoned ; the King would be quietly murdered and slid down the pipe . And – here comes an ingenious touch – one of the Six would take his place in the cell , and , on the entrance of the searchers , loudly demand release and redress ; and Michael , being summoned , would confess to hasty action , but he would say the man had angered him by seeking the favour of a lady in the Castle ( this was Antoinette de Mauban ) and he had confined him there , as he conceived he , as Lord of Zenda , had right to do . But he was now , on receiving his apology , content to let him go , and so end the gossip which , to his Highness's annoyance , had arisen concerning a prisoner in Zenda , and had given his visitors the trouble of this enquiry . The visitors , baffled , would retire , and Michael could , at his leisure , dispose of the body of the King . Sapt , Fritz , and I in my bed , looked round on one another in horror and bewilderment at the cruelty and cunning of the plan . Whether I went in peace or in war , openly at the head of a corps , or secretly by a stealthy assault , the King would be dead before I could come near him . If Michael were stronger and overcame my party , there would be an end . But if I were stronger , I should have no way to punish him , no means of proving any guilt in him without proving my own guilt also . On the other hand , I should be left as King ( ah ! for a moment my pulse quickened ) and it would be for the future to witness the final struggle between him and me . He seemed to have made triumph possible and ruin impossible . At the worst , he would stand as well as he had stood before I crossed his path – with but one man between him and the throne , and that man an impostor ; at best , there would be none left to stand against him . I had begun to think that Black Michael was over fond of leaving the fighting to his friends ; but now I acknowledged that the brains , if not the arms , of the conspiracy were his . "" Does the King know this ? "" I asked . "" I and my brother , "" answered Johann , "" put up the pipe , under the orders of my Lord of Hentzau . He was on guard that day , and the King asked my lord what it meant . "" Faith , "" he answered , with his airy laugh , "" it 's a new improvement on the ladder of Jacob , whereby , as you have read , sire , men pass from the earth to heaven . We thought it not meet that your Majesty should go , in case , sire , you must go , by the common route . So we have made you a pretty private passage where the vulgar can not stare at you or incommode your passage . That , sire , is the meaning of that pipe . "" And he laughed and bowed , and prayed the King's leave to replenish the King's glass – for the King was at supper . And the King , though he is a brave man , as are all of his House , grew red and then white as he looked on the pipe and at the merry devil who mocked him . Ah , sir "" ( and the fellow shuddered ) , "" it is not easy to sleep quiet in the Castle of Zenda , for all of them would as soon cut a man's throat as play a game at cards ; and my Lord Rupert would choose it sooner for a pastime than any other – ay , sooner than he would ruin a woman , though that he loves also . "" The man ceased , and I bade Fritz take him away and have him carefully guarded ; and , turning to him , I added : "" If anyone asks you if there is a prisoner in Zenda , you may answer "" Yes . "" But if any asks who the prisoner is , do not answer . For all my promises will not save you if any man here learns from you the truth as to the prisoner of Zenda . I 'll kill you like a dog if the thing be so much as breathed within the house ! "" Then , when he was gone , I looked at Sapt . "" It 's a hard nut ! "" said I. "" So hard , "" said he , shaking his grizzled head , "" that as I think , this time next year is like to find you still King of Ruritania ! "" and he broke out into curses on Michael's cunning . I lay back on my pillows . "" There seems to me , "" I observed , "" to be two ways by which the King can come out of Zenda alive . One is by treachery in the duke's followers . "" "" You can leave that out , "" said Sapt . "" I hope not , "" I rejoined , "" because the other I was about to mention is – by a miracle from heaven ! "" </doc>

899,A4,"DES BUYS A NEW SHED "" I 've come to a major decision , "" announced Des one morning in the cafe . "" I ca n't put it off any longer . "" "" Oh thank goodness , "" said Mick . "" Yes , it 's been something of an embarrassment for ages , "" said Des . "" So the time has now come to splash out and buy a brand new one ! "" "" You 're joking ?! "" exclaimed Clive . "" Have you finally come to your senses ?! "" "" Yep , "" said Des . "" I 'm going to get a really nifty top-of-the-range model ! "" "" Fantastic ! "" said Clive . "" Maybe this will mean house prices will finally be on the rise round here ! "" "" Why are you always so bothered about house prices ? "" said Mick . "" Because when my house finally reaches a reasonable price I 'll be able to sell it and leave you bunch of muppets behind forever !! "" said Clive . Just then Mike the Manic Mechanic walked in . "" Hey Mike , great news , Des is finally going to buy a new car ! "" said Clive . "" Brilliant Des , about time too ! "" said Mike . "" Now I 've got some fantastic deals on at the moment , how do you fancy a brand new used 1983 Fiesta XR2 with a mere 4000 totally genuine honest guv miles on the clock and a sunroof ! "" Just then Mrs Greasy came out with their lunch . "" Oh my goodness , look at the time ! "" said Clive suddenly . "" I 'm due at the squash club !! "" He got up and dashed out of the café . "" No , no , Mike , I 'm not buying a new car !! "" said Des . "" Clive misunderstood what I was talking about !! What would I want to buy a new car for , I could never sell my beloved Fiat 126 !! "" "" Darn , "" said Mike . "" I was talking about my snowdome ! "" said Des . "" Look at it , it does n't even work any more !

"" Oh yes , and I 'm getting a new shed as well , "" said Des . "" But first I must clear out the old one . "" After having to endure Mrs Greasy's lunch , Des went back to his house and down his garden to begin clearing out his shed . Mick came along as well since he evidently had nothing better to do .

They looked at the shed – the walls were all leaning inwards , there was no glass in the window frames and there were numerous holes in the canvas roof . "" Okay , you open the door , "" said Des . "" Why me ? "" said Mick . "" Well ... I have n't been in there for about ten years , "" said Des . "" I 'm afraid that if I open the door the whole thing might just collapse ! "" "" Well I 'm not opening it !! "" said Mick . "" Do you think I 'm mad ?! "" "" Let 's find someone else to do it then , "" said Des . "" Like Clive ! "" "" But he 's gone down the squash club ! "" said Mick . "" No he 's not , he 's over there in his garden ! "" said Des . Clive was sitting on his garden , sipping an ice cold drink , as it was quite a warm day . Des and Mick walked across to the fence and peered over at him . "" What do you want ?! "" snapped Clive . "" Ca n't you see I 'm busy !! "" "" You 're supposed to be at the squash club ! "" said Mick . "" I am ! The orange squash club ! Membership of one ! And I 'd like it to stay that way !! "" "" We were just wondering if you could come and open my shed door , "" said Des . "" Are you mad , I 'm not going in that rickety old thing ! "" said Clive . "" And that 's final ! "" "" Um ... I 've got some rare vinyl Bee Gees albums in there ! "" said Des . Immediately Clive put his drink down , walked over the fence , straight across Des's garden and opened the shed door . He walked inside the shed and started searching for the Bee Gees records . "" Oh , "" said Des , slightly disappointed to see that the shed had not collapsed around Clive's ears . "" See Mick , perfectly safe ! "" "" Where are these records then ?! "" said Clive . "" Umm , well actually I have n't really ... "" said Des . "" Oh here they are ! "" said Clive , picking up a box in the corner . "" Cor , there 's some classic stuff here ! Thanks Des !! "" Clive walked out of the shed carrying the box of Bee Gees records while Des looked on in amazement . "" You 're not a secret Bee Gees fan are you ?! "" said Mick . "" No I 'm not , it 's so long since I 've been in that shed I 've no idea what 's in there ! "" said Des . "" Anyway , Clive has proved it 's perfectly safe to go in there , come on ! "" "" Hmmm , I think I 'll just hang around outside , it 's quite a nice day today ! "" said Mick . "" Suit yourself , "" said Des . He went inside the shed and started searching through piles of stuff . Before long the contents of the shed were piling up outside . Other than the usual garden equipment , they included a moose's head , an old gramophone , a model skeleton , a birdcage , a trilby , ten garden gnomes , an old cooker , a rocking horse , some flying ducks , and a massive poster of Bob Carolgees and Spit the Dog . As Mick looked on , he kept expecting the shed to come crashing down at any minute , but remarkably it still managed to stay up . After an hour or so , Des had finally finished clearing it out , and he and Mick looked round at all the junk that had taken over Des's garden . "" Did all that stuff really fit inside that small shed ?! "" said Mick . "" Certainly did ! "" said Des . The shed now looked even more precarious now everything had been cleared out . Mick peered inside and saw there was still one thing left inside - a rake that was leaning against the wall . "" Oi Des , that 's my rake , I always wondered what happened to that !! "" exclaimed Mick . "" Is it ? "" said Des . "" Oh no , I would n't ... "" Mick strode inside and claimed his rake . Immediately the wall collapsed inwards . Mick tried to dart out the way , but then the other walls began to fall inwards . Mick went through an empty window frame , and then right through the canvas roof as it crashed down . He was left standing there with his rake , covered in dust , in the middle of the remains of the shed . "" Oh Mick , that rake was the only thing holding the shed up ! "" said Des , who was stood well back . "" Was it really ?!?! "" exclaimed Mick . "" At least it saves taking it apart ! "" said Des . "" Oi you lot , keep the noise down , I 've trying to enjoy a peaceful sit in the garden !! "" shouted Clive . "" Hey Clive , you do n't want a moose's head , do you ? "" said Des . "" Oh , you 've got one already ! Ha !! "" Clive snarled . "" Seriously though , is there anything you do want ? "" said Des . "" Poster of Bob Carolgees ? I can see you 're tempted ! "" "" No ! "" said Clive . "" What about you , Mick ? "" said Des . "" I do n't want a poster of him either ! "" said Clive . "" That 's just a pile of ridiculous old junk ! "" said Mick , who was busy wiping the dust off himself . "" Why do n't you just get rid of it all !! "" "" Naaah ! "" said Des . "" Might be worth something one day ! "" Des cleared the bits of the shed out of the way . Next came the big purchase – a brand new shed ! But first of all Des had to go and quickly buy his new snowdome . Then he went to the garden centre , with Mick tagging along . "" What a vast selection of sheds on offer ! "" said Mick , looking at the vast selection of sheds on offer . They were located outside the garden centre itself , in an area adjacent to the car park . "" I 'll have that one , "" said Des , pointing at the first shed he saw . "" Are n't you going to have a look around ? "" said Mick . "" See what else is on offer ? Perhaps buy a copy of ' Which Shed ' ? That 's what I did ! "" "" You would , "" said Des . "" Look at them , they 're all the same ! I 'll have this one , looks good enough to me ! "" Des handed over the cash to the sales assistant , and the shed was now in Des's possession . "" Now the only problem is ... "" said Des . "" How am I going to get it home ? "" He tried lifting it , without much success , obviously . "" Could n't you just get the garden centre to deliver it ? "" said Mick . Just then Mike the Manic Mechanic came up to them , carrying a large garden gnome . "" Oh hi there Des and Mick , "" said Mike . They looked at his gnome . "" Oh no , it 's not for me , it 's for my Aunty Mavis's birthday . I do n't like her , so I thought she 'd hate this ! Is that your new shed ? "" Des stared hard at the shed for several seconds . "" You know what Mike , I think it is ! "" said Des . "" Thanks for pointing it out ! "" "" No problem , "" said Mike . "" Actually , I have got a bit of a problem , "" said Des . "" I know that , "" said Mike . "" How am I going to get this shed home ? "" said Des . "" Could you perhaps ... "" "" The answer is obvious !! "" exclaimed Mike . "" Bring round your car ! "" Des drove round his car from the car park . When he got out , Mike started taking off the wheels . "" Mike , what are you doing ?! "" exclaimed Des . "" Simple ! "" said Mike . "" I 'm going to transfer the wheels , engine , chassis and steering column from your car onto this shed . Then you can drive it home !! "" "" Riiiight , "" said Mick . Des was a bit unsure about this idea , but since Mike had already started the process he did n't like to interrupt . "" Erm Mike , this wo n't take long , will it ? "" said Des . "" Naaah , three or four hours should do it !! "" said Mike . "" Okay ... "" said Des . "" And then when we get it home , I 'll transfer everything back onto your car and it 'll be as good as new ! "" said Mike . "" Unless you 'd like to pop round to my garage and choose a classy little number from my selection of hot Fords ! "" "" No thanks , "" said Des . They watched as Mike busily took the body of Des's Fiat 126 away from the chassis . "" I ca n't help thinking there must have been a simpler way to get that shed home , "" sighed Des . "" Like asking the garden centre to deliver it ? "" said Mick . "" Or asking Mike to deliver it on a pick-up or something ? "" "" What 's that , Mick ? "" said Mike . "" Oh nothing , nothing , "" said Mick . After about five hours Mike had finally finished . The shed now had wheels , lights , an engine , a chassis , a steering wheel , bumpers and number plates , all donated by Des's Fiat 126 . As the floorpan was taken from the Fiat , the engine had to be placed at the rear of the shed . At the front Mike had removed the door from its hinges , and plonked a seat there . Bolted onto the front was the steering column , pedals and a load of wires . "" Whaddya think !! "" said Mike . "" Pretty nifty , eh ! "" "" Super , "" mumbled Mick . "" Just one thing , "" said Des . "" How am I going to get my car home ? "" He pointed at the shell of his Fiat . "" Umm ... "" said Mike . "" Ca n't you ask the garden centre to deliver it ? "" "" Too late , the garden centre 's closed ! "" exclaimed Mick . "" It 's starting to get dark ! "" "" I know what to do ! "" said Mike . "" I reckon your car 's just small enough ! "" Mike set about removing one of the side walls of the shed . "" Good grief , "" sighed Mick . Mike , Des and Mick heaved the shell of the car inside the shed , and Mike replaced the wall . "" There ! "" said Mike . "" Now all you have to do is drive it home ! "" "" Thank goodness it 's getting dark , hopefully no one will see me ! "" said Des . He carefully went and sat down on the seat at the front of the shed . "" It should drive just like your Fiat ! "" said Mike . "" In other words , terribly ! "" "" Are you sure it 's road legal ? "" said Des . "" Course it is , you 've got lights , seat belt , number plates , tax disc ! "" said Mike . "" What more do you want , an MOT document ?! "" "" Umm ... "" said Des . "" Just start the engine !! "" exclaimed Mike . Des did so , and the familiar rumble of the Fiat 126 engine was heard . "" I 'll give you a lift home , Mick , "" said Mike . "" Thanks Mike , I would n't be seen dead in a thing like that ! "" said Mick . "" Too right , nor me !! "" said Mike . They watched as Des put his foot on the accelerator pedal , and the shed began to trundle through the car park . "" ' Ere Mike , is this as fast as it will go ?! "" shouted Des . Because the shell of his Fiat 126 was weighing the shed down , Des was finding that the engine barely had enough power to propel the shed along at any great speed . "" Sorry Des , not a lot I can do about that !! "" shouted back Mike . "" I 'll see you in the morning to put your car back together again !! "" Mick and Mike whizzed off home in Mike's Cortina , while Des was left trailing in his motorised shed . "" He could at least have put a turbocharger in , "" grumbled Des . Des trundled along the road at a speed that would make a milk float look fast . "" I hope PC Plod's in bed ! "" thought Des . "" I 'm not sure if this is exactly legal ! "" Unfortunately he was n't . Des soon noticed Plod riding behind him on his bike . It did n't take long for Plod to catch him up . "" Excuse me sir , may I have a quick word with you ? "" said Plod . "" Oh no come on , no way was I exceeding the speed limit this time ! "" exclaimed Des . "" Is this your , erm , vehicle , sir ? "" asked Plod . "" Well ... yeeees ... but ... "" said Des . "" Have you a vehicle registration certificate ? "" said Plod . "" It does n't exactly look roadworthy to me . "" "" Oh yes it is , it 's passed its MOT and everything ! "" said Des . "" Can I see your vehicle registration certificate please ? "" asked Plod . "" Err ... tell you what , I have n't got it on me at the moment , so come round my house tomorrow and I 'll show it to you then ! "" "" Right you are , sir , "" said Plod . "" I 'll see you tomorrow . "" He raced off on his bicycle to continue fighting crime . Des decided he would deal with the problem in the morning . When he finally arrived home , as it was now getting very late , he decided to leave the shed parked in the front drive overnight , and hoped no one would steal it ( yeah right , as if anyone 's going to steal a motorised shed ) . The next morning , when Des got up , he looked out of the window and was surprised to see Clive looking at his new shed , weeping . He went outside to see him . "" Clive , what 's the matter ? "" said Des . "" Why me ?! "" moaned Clive . "" Why me ?!?!? "" "" What are you talking about ?! "" said Des . "" Of all the millions of people on this planet , why did I have to end up with you as my neighbour ?!?! "" "" I do n't know what you mean ! "" said Des . "" You ca n't do anything sensible , can you ?! "" exclaimed Clive . "" All you had to do was to buy a new car !! But no , you have to go and buy a shed on wheels !!!! "" "" That 's not my new car , "" said Des . "" It 's not ? "" said Clive . "" It 's my new shed , "" said Des . "" The wheels and engine are only temporary . "" "" Oh thank goodness , "" said Clive . "" So where 's your new car then ? "" "" I 'm not getting a new car !! "" said Des . "" There 's nothing wrong with my Fiat 126 !! I will keep it forever !! "" Clive started weeping again . Just then Mike the Manic Mechanic turned up . "" What 's wrong with him ?! "" said Mike . "" I do n't know , he 's just got some ridiculous in-built prejudice against both Fiat 126s and sheds on wheels , "" said Des . "" Well , whatever , let 's get your car shipshape again ! "" said Mike . "" Or even carshape again ! "" Mike spent the next five hours returning all the car bits and pieces from the shed to the car . "" There , what did I tell you ! "" said Mike . "" It 's as good as new !! "" Des had to admit , his Fiat 126 was now just as it had been before Mike started meddling with it . "" That 'll be £ 500 + VAT please , "" said Mike . "" What ?!?! "" exclaimed Des . "" I thought you were doing it as a favour ! "" "" I was ! "" said Mike . "" And an extremely inexpensive favour it was too ! "" Des handed the cash to Mike , who then went back to his garage . Just then PC Plod came along . "" Good afternoon sir , have you managed to produce a vehicle registration certificate for that shed yet ? "" asked Plod . "" PC Plod , what are you talking about , why do I need a vehicle registration certificate for a shed ?! "" Plod stared long and hard at the shed . It was indeed an ordinary , common-or-garden shed ! He scratched his head and then tried rubbing his eyes . "" Err , well , err ... sorry to bother you sir , I did have rather a long night ... "" Plod hurried back to the police station to book a long holiday . Meanwhile Des went over to Mick's house and rang his doorbell . Mick answered . "" Mick , I 've got a problem , "" said Des . Mick groaned . "" You see my new shed ? "" said Des . "" How are we going to get it from the front drive to the back garden ? "" "" How about taking your house apart , lifting the shed across and then putting your house back together ! "" "" That 's a good idea ... naah , it 'd take too long ! "" said Des . "" Quicker to take the shed apart ! "" Des grabbed a reluctant Mick over to his front drive . "" Now this ca n't be too difficult , I 'm sure I 've done it sometime before ... "" said Des . "" All I need is a hammer . Because if I had a hammer , I 'd hammer in the morning , I 'd hammer in the evening , all over this land . "" "" What about the afternoon ? "" said Mick . "" Tea break , "" said Des . He went and fetched a couple of hammers and they set to work taking the shed apart . Then they carried the parts through the garage and into the back garden , which was still covered in moose's heads , skeletons , bird cages etc. By now Mick was exhausted , so Des single-handedly put the shed back together , in its new , permanent position at long last . "" There you go ! "" said Des . "" Looks great , does n't it ! "" "" No , "" said Mick . Des was about to start piling all his junk into the new shed when Mick decided to point something out to him . "" Des , "" said Mick . "" Your new shed looks as though it 's about to collapse ! "" "" Really ? "" said Des . He stared carefully at it . "" Oh yes , you 're right ! "" Following Des's rebuild , all of the walls were now leaning inwards . In fact they were on the brink of falling right in . "" Now I remember why the walls on the old shed always leant inwards !! "" exclaimed Des . "" Tell you what , can I borrow your rake ? "" </doc>

1518,A7,"Nonverbal Communication Help for Salespeople Dear Sue : I am fairly new to an outside sales position and am looking for information about non-verbal communication . I am interested in learning about office settings . Any other information that can help me to ' read ' a situation better would be appreciated . - Amy Sue Says : During the average 30-minute sales call , a buyer and seller exchange approximately 800 different nonverbal messages , yet most salespeople focus on the verbal part of the sale , according to Jan Hargrave , a body language consultant and author of the book , Strictly Business Body Language . Salespeople who pay attention to body language typically focus almost exclusively on facial expressions . However , the way words are spoken and the speakers face all provide information about how the sales call is going . The voice and face are only part of the picture . The body is the communication channel over which we have the least control and understand the least , but has the most impact . Where you sit and how the furniture is arranged can either encourage friendliness and cooperation or confrontation . Hargrave says that sitting across the table from a person during a negotiation creates a defensive , competitive atmosphere and can lead to each party taking a firm stand on his or her point of view . The table becomes a solid barrier between both parties and allows for a distinct division of ideas . Massive desks create a physical barrier , and serve as a visual barrier as well . If you ca n't see someone from the chest down , you do n't know if the buyer's legs are crossed , if he 's tapping his foot or cleaning his nails . Office furniture can be arranged in a way to give a person as much power , status or control over others as they wish . Just sitting behind a desk conveys a sense of power and positioning because all who enter must look across it , which gives the person behind it control . Increased status and power can be achieved with : Low sofas for visitors to sit on . A wall covered with photos , awards or qualifications that the occupant has received . A slim briefcase ; those who do all the work carry large , bulky briefcases . Red folders on a desk marked "" Strictly Confidential . "" An expensive ashtray placed out of reach of the visitor causing him inconvenience when ashing a cigarette . ( I do not recommend smoking on a sales call , however . ) You are wise to take in a person's environment to learn more about that person . If you are having trouble communicating with someone , moving to a new location , changing positions or getting him or her to come out from behind a desk can change the dynamics of the interaction . </doc>

428,A8,"Michael Yardy anchored Sussex 's 355 for eight with an unbeaten hundred which spanned almost the whole of the first day against Kent at Hove . The stoic left-hander came in to face the second ball of this Liverpool Victoria Division One match - after Sussex had lost Richard Montgomerie for nought - and remained an immovable object until stumps . Yardy ( 126 not out ) faced 298 balls and managed 13 fours - his watchfulness a necessary foil to the shot-makers who came and went around him , notable among whom was Murray Goodwin ( 82 ) for his domination of a third-wicket stand of 141 . The hosts , who chose to bat first on a sunny morning , closed day one already in possession of four of the seven points they need from this fixture to usurp Lancashire at the top of the table . But as championship cricket returned following the mid-summer Twenty20 break , they could hardly have got off to a worse start when Montgomerie went lbw pushing forward to Amjad Khan . The Kent fast bowler thought he had struck again three balls later , but this time Yardy survived on nought despite a significant appeal for caught behind . He remained in situ on an even batting surface for another six-and-a-half hours , having been heavily outscored in his 29-over association with Goodwin who hit 11 fours and a six in a fluent 108-ball stay . After South Africa seamer Tyron Henderson had opener Carl Hopkinson lbw padding up for a maiden championship wicket , Goodwin was initially circumspect . But the Zimbabwean gradually took the initiative either side of lunch with a clutch of crisp drives down the ground and good runs square of the wicket as well . With Yardy content to continue at his own unhurried tempo , though , Goodwin eventually paid for his adventure . Two balls after hitting Min Patel for a straight six , he again went down the wicket and was unable to regain his ground when the slow left-armer pushed the ball wider and flatter . Chris Adams and Matthew Prior both went cheaply , the captain lbw offering no stroke to Khan and the wicket-keeper becoming Dwayne Bravo's first championship victim when he plonked a drive straight to short extra-cover . When Luke Wright somehow propelled an abortive leg-side thrash at Patel only as far as short mid-off to go for a duck Sussex had lost four wickets for only 44 runs . Yardy was unperturbed , however and - as the likes of Yasir Arafat and Ollie Rayner took transient responsibility for the run rate in a series of handy late-order stands - he inched into three figures by midway through the evening session . Along the way , there was plenty of lapping and sweeping of spinners Patel and James Tredwell as well as canny placement of pace and the occasional full-blooded pull . Yardy's ritual and plentiful movement in the crease against the seamers resulted only in conspicuous strokelessness for long periods once the ball arrived . But when the loose deliveries came his way they were regularly dispatched as he continued his unfussy accumulation . His innings will rarely have anyone on the edge of their Hove deckchairs . Even so this second hundred of an injury-interrupted season could yet prove a springboard for Sussex as they go in search of championship title number two in the second half of the summer .

1333,A1,"CHOICE on October 21 , 2012 I believe one of the greatest gifts we have as human beings is choice . We are not robots forced to take a certain path . We are not formed on an assembly line of identical parts put together to mimic the models made before us , and to be the same as those that will follow . We have been formed uniquely to fulfill a specific purpose , a specific need . As pieces of an enormous jigsaw puzzle with each piece formed to interlock with another , creating a unit which represents all of the individual pieces and revealing a unified "" big picture "" that is greater than each of us separately . Our likes and dislikes , the things we enjoy and those we simply tolerate . The flavors of our favorite ice cream or our favorite color are not the same as everyone else 's . Coffee or tea , deep dish or thin crust , the mountains or the sea are all choices , we get to choose . While some of us have commonalities in our choices none of us are exactly alike . Even identical twins , brought up in the same environment have their unique qualities and gifts . Our manufacturer , our maker , our creator made us deliberately on purpose to be unique ! Because of that we are inherently different yet we all share the ability to make choices ! As we , in the United States move toward the national election scheduled to take place on Tuesday , November 6th I ask , no I implore you to prayerfully make choices . You can certainly ask you neighbor or seek advice from a friend , however you have a choice ! Think critically ; study the ballot measures and the candidates . Go to the various websites ; study the guides available on the matters pending for your approval . If you have not registered to vote yet , Monday , October 22nd is the last day to get that taken care of before this election . Take time over this next week to review the candidates , what they truly appear to support . Look for the signs , the red flags the indications that you are making a good choice . Many of you take months to make a purchase after diligent research . Is not your part in the direction of this country as important ? Do not become apathetic and affirm your vote wo n't count . If you meet the eligibility requirements to vote , you have been given a choice and by not voting you are choosing . You are choosing to disrespect the countless individuals that have lost their lives and sacrificed their freedoms to allow you the opportunity to exercise your power to choose ! Is there the possibility that you could make a wrong choice ? Can the person or measures that you feel strongly about being a success fail ? Yes and yes however , that does not make your choice any less valuable . The existence of choice acknowledges that some of the options are good ; some are better and some well not so much . In my mind not voting is not so much . Whatever your choice choose knowing that you are using your gift in the best way you possibly can . Voting is a privilege with privilege comes responsibility . Pray , do your homework , vote early , and in a few weeks when the results are announced , be ready to roll up your sleeves and be involved . Regardless of the outcomes you will again have the choice to do your best to be part of the solution . Because our Creator knows that we do not always make the best choices He has a plan to override our missteps . When all of the puzzle pieces have had a chance to be in place He will finish the "" Big Picture "" . Only He can fill the gaps and complete the work He started in the beginning . So know that the choices you and I make in this election process may be flawed however , as we do His will He will always provide a way out . Let us seek first the kingdom and His way of doing and being right and all things will be added . ( Matthew 6 : 33 ) </doc>

63,A4,"CHAPTER III . _IMMANIS PECORIS CUSTOS , IMMANIOR IPSE_ . Now , in 1482 , Quasimodo had grown up . He had become a few years previously the bellringer of Notre-Dame , thanks to his father by adoption , Claude Frollo , -- who had become archdeacon of Josas , thanks to his suzerain , Messire Louis de Beaumont , -- who had become Bishop of Paris , at the death of Guillaume Chartier in 1472 , thanks to his patron , Olivier Le Daim , barber to Louis XI . , king by the grace of God . So Quasimodo was the ringer of the chimes of Notre-Dame . In the course of time there had been formed a certain peculiarly intimate bond which united the ringer to the church . Separated forever from the world , by the double fatality of his unknown birth and his natural deformity , imprisoned from his infancy in that impassable double circle , the poor wretch had grown used to seeing nothing in this world beyond the religious walls which had received him under their shadow . Notre-Dame had been to him successively , as he grew up and developed , the egg , the nest , the house , the country , the universe . There was certainly a sort of mysterious and pre-existing harmony between this creature and this church . When , still a little fellow , he had dragged himself tortuously and by jerks beneath the shadows of its vaults , he seemed , with his human face and his bestial limbs , the natural reptile of that humid and sombre pavement , upon which the shadow of the Romanesque capitals cast so many strange forms . Later on , the first time that he caught hold , mechanically , of the ropes to the towers , and hung suspended from them , and set the bell to clanging , it produced upon his adopted father , Claude , the effect of a child whose tongue is unloosed and who begins to speak . It is thus that , little by little , developing always in sympathy with the cathedral , living there , sleeping there , hardly ever leaving it , subject every hour to the mysterious impress , he came to resemble it , he incrusted himself in it , so to speak , and became an integral part of it . His salient angles fitted into the retreating angles of the cathedral ( if we may be allowed this figure of speech ) , and he seemed not only its inhabitant but more than that , its natural tenant . One might almost say that he had assumed its form , as the snail takes on the form of its shell . It was his dwelling , his hole , his envelope . There existed between him and the old church so profound an instinctive sympathy , so many magnetic affinities , so many material affinities , that he adhered to it somewhat as a tortoise adheres to its shell . The rough and wrinkled cathedral was his shell . It is useless to warn the reader not to take literally all the similes which we are obliged to employ here to express the singular , symmetrical , direct , almost consubstantial union of a man and an edifice . It is equally unnecessary to state to what a degree that whole cathedral was familiar to him , after so long and so intimate a cohabitation . That dwelling was peculiar to him . It had no depths to which Quasimodo had not penetrated , no height which he had not scaled . He often climbed many stones up the front , aided solely by the uneven points of the carving . The towers , on whose exterior surface he was frequently seen clambering , like a lizard gliding along a perpendicular wall , those two gigantic twins , so lofty , so menacing , so formidable , possessed for him neither vertigo , nor terror , nor shocks of amazement . To see them so gentle under his hand , so easy to scale , one would have said that he had tamed them . By dint of leaping , climbing , gambolling amid the abysses of the gigantic cathedral he had become , in some sort , a monkey and a goat , like the Calabrian child who swims before he walks , and plays with the sea while still a babe . Moreover , it was not his body alone which seemed fashioned after the Cathedral , but his mind also . In what condition was that mind ? What bent had it contracted , what form had it assumed beneath that knotted envelope , in that savage life ? This it would be hard to determine . Quasimodo had been born one-eyed , hunchbacked , lame . It was with great difficulty , and by dint of great patience that Claude Frollo had succeeded in teaching him to talk . But a fatality was attached to the poor foundling . Bellringer of Notre-Dame at the age of fourteen , a new infirmity had come to complete his misfortunes : the bells had broken the drums of his ears ; he had become deaf . The only gate which nature had left wide open for him had been abruptly closed , and forever . In closing , it had cut off the only ray of joy and of light which still made its way into the soul of Quasimodo . His soul fell into profound night . The wretched being's misery became as incurable and as complete as his deformity . Let us add that his deafness rendered him to some extent dumb . For , in order not to make others laugh , the very moment that he found himself to be deaf , he resolved upon a silence which he only broke when he was alone . He voluntarily tied that tongue which Claude Frollo had taken so much pains to unloose . Hence , it came about , that when necessity constrained him to speak , his tongue was torpid , awkward , and like a door whose hinges have grown rusty . If now we were to try to penetrate to the soul of Quasimodo through that thick , hard rind ; if we could sound the depths of that badly constructed organism ; if it were granted to us to look with a torch behind those non-transparent organs to explore the shadowy interior of that opaque creature , to elucidate his obscure corners , his absurd no-thoroughfares , and suddenly to cast a vivid light upon the soul enchained at the extremity of that cave , we should , no doubt , find the unhappy Psyche in some poor , cramped , and ricketty attitude , like those prisoners beneath the Leads of Venice , who grew old bent double in a stone box which was both too low and too short for them . It is certain that the mind becomes atrophied in a defective body . Quasimodo was barely conscious of a soul cast in his own image , moving blindly within him . The impressions of objects underwent a considerable refraction before reaching his mind . His brain was a peculiar medium ; the ideas which passed through it issued forth completely distorted . The reflection which resulted from this refraction was , necessarily , divergent and perverted . Hence a thousand optical illusions , a thousand aberrations of judgment , a thousand deviations , in which his thought strayed , now mad , now idiotic . The first effect of this fatal organization was to trouble the glance which he cast upon things . He received hardly any immediate perception of them . The external world seemed much farther away to him than it does to us . The second effect of his misfortune was to render him malicious . He was malicious , in fact , because he was savage ; he was savage because he was ugly . There was logic in his nature , as there is in ours . His strength , so extraordinarily developed , was a cause of still greater malevolence : "" _Malus puer robustus_ , "" says Hobbes . This justice must , however be rendered to him . Malevolence was not , perhaps , innate in him . From his very first steps among men , he had felt himself , later on he had seen himself , spewed out , blasted , rejected . Human words were , for him , always a raillery or a malediction . As he grew up , he had found nothing but hatred around him . He had caught the general malevolence . He had picked up the weapon with which he had been wounded . After all , he turned his face towards men only with reluctance ; his cathedral was sufficient for him . It was peopled with marble figures , -- kings , saints , bishops , -- who at least did not burst out laughing in his face , and who gazed upon him only with tranquillity and kindliness . The other statues , those of the monsters and demons , cherished no hatred for him , Quasimodo . He resembled them too much for that . They seemed rather , to be scoffing at other men . The saints were his friends , and blessed him ; the monsters were his friends and guarded him . So he held long communion with them . He sometimes passed whole hours crouching before one of these statues , in solitary conversation with it . If any one came , he fled like a lover surprised in his serenade . And the cathedral was not only society for him , but the universe , and all nature beside . He dreamed of no other hedgerows than the painted windows , always in flower ; no other shade than that of the foliage of stone which spread out , loaded with birds , in the tufts of the Saxon capitals ; of no other mountains than the colossal towers of the church ; of no other ocean than Paris , roaring at their bases . What he loved above all else in the maternal edifice , that which aroused his soul , and made it open its poor wings , which it kept so miserably folded in its cavern , that which sometimes rendered him even happy , was the bells . He loved them , fondled them , talked to them , understood them . From the chime in the spire , over the intersection of the aisles and nave , to the great bell of the front , he cherished a tenderness for them all . The central spire and the two towers were to him as three great cages , whose birds , reared by himself , sang for him alone . Yet it was these very bells which had made him deaf ; but mothers often love best that child which has caused them the most suffering . It is true that their voice was the only one which he could still hear . On this score , the big bell was his beloved . It was she whom he preferred out of all that family of noisy girls which bustled above him , on festival days . This bell was named Marie . She was alone in the southern tower , with her sister Jacqueline , a bell of lesser size , shut up in a smaller cage beside hers . This Jacqueline was so called from the name of the wife of Jean Montagu , who had given it to the church , which had not prevented his going and figuring without his head at Montfauçon . In the second tower there were six other bells , and , finally , six smaller ones inhabited the belfry over the crossing , with the wooden bell , which rang only between after dinner on Good Friday and the morning of the day before Easter . So Quasimodo had fifteen bells in his seraglio ; but big Marie was his favorite . No idea can be formed of his delight on days when the grand peal was sounded . At the moment when the archdeacon dismissed him , and said , "" Go ! "" he mounted the spiral staircase of the clock tower faster than any one else could have descended it . He entered perfectly breathless into the aerial chamber of the great bell ; he gazed at her a moment , devoutly and lovingly ; then he gently addressed her and patted her with his hand , like a good horse , which is about to set out on a long journey . He pitied her for the trouble that she was about to suffer . After these first caresses , he shouted to his assistants , placed in the lower story of the tower , to begin . They grasped the ropes , the wheel creaked , the enormous capsule of metal started slowly into motion . Quasimodo followed it with his glance and trembled . The first shock of the clapper and the brazen wall made the framework upon which it was mounted quiver . Quasimodo vibrated with the bell . "" Vah ! "" he cried , with a senseless burst of laughter . However , the movement of the bass was accelerated , and , in proportion as it described a wider angle , Quasimodo's eye opened also more and more widely , phosphoric and flaming . At length the grand peal began ; the whole tower trembled ; woodwork , leads , cut stones , all groaned at once , from the piles of the foundation to the trefoils of its summit . Then Quasimodo boiled and frothed ; he went and came ; he trembled from head to foot with the tower . The bell , furious , running riot , presented to the two walls of the tower alternately its brazen throat , whence escaped that tempestuous breath , which is audible leagues away . Quasimodo stationed himself in front of this open throat ; he crouched and rose with the oscillations of the bell , breathed in this overwhelming breath , gazed by turns at the deep place , which swarmed with people , two hundred feet below him , and at that enormous , brazen tongue which came , second after second , to howl in his ear . It was the only speech which he understood , the only sound which broke for him the universal silence . He swelled out in it as a bird does in the sun . All of a sudden , the frenzy of the bell seized upon him ; his look became extraordinary ; he lay in wait for the great bell as it passed , as a spider lies in wait for a fly , and flung himself abruptly upon it , with might and main . Then , suspended above the abyss , borne to and fro by the formidable swinging of the bell , he seized the brazen monster by the ear-laps , pressed it between both knees , spurred it on with his heels , and redoubled the fury of the peal with the whole shock and weight of his body . Meanwhile , the tower trembled ; he shrieked and gnashed his teeth , his red hair rose erect , his breast heaving like a bellows , his eye flashed flames , the monstrous bell neighed , panting , beneath him ; and then it was no longer the great bell of Notre-Dame nor Quasimodo : it was a dream , a whirlwind , a tempest , dizziness mounted astride of noise ; a spirit clinging to a flying crupper , a strange centaur , half man , half bell ; a sort of horrible Astolphus , borne away upon a prodigious hippogriff of living bronze . The presence of this extraordinary being caused , as it were , a breath of life to circulate throughout the entire cathedral . It seemed as though there escaped from him , at least according to the growing superstitions of the crowd , a mysterious emanation which animated all the stones of Notre-Dame , and made the deep bowels of the ancient church to palpitate . It sufficed for people to know that he was there , to make them believe that they beheld the thousand statues of the galleries and the fronts in motion . And the cathedral did indeed seem a docile and obedient creature beneath his hand ; it waited on his will to raise its great voice ; it was possessed and filled with Quasimodo , as with a familiar spirit . One would have said that he made the immense edifice breathe . He was everywhere about it ; in fact , he multiplied himself on all points of the structure . Now one perceived with affright at the very top of one of the towers , a fantastic dwarf climbing , writhing , crawling on all fours , descending outside above the abyss , leaping from projection to projection , and going to ransack the belly of some sculptured gorgon ; it was Quasimodo dislodging the crows . Again , in some obscure corner of the church one came in contact with a sort of living chimera , crouching and scowling ; it was Quasimodo engaged in thought . Sometimes one caught sight , upon a bell tower , of an enormous head and a bundle of disordered limbs swinging furiously at the end of a rope ; it was Quasimodo ringing vespers or the Angelus . Often at night a hideous form was seen wandering along the frail balustrade of carved lacework , which crowns the towers and borders the circumference of the apse ; again it was the hunchback of Notre-Dame . Then , said the women of the neighborhood , the whole church took on something fantastic , supernatural , horrible ; eyes and mouths were opened , here and there ; one heard the dogs , the monsters , and the gargoyles of stone , which keep watch night and day , with outstretched neck and open jaws , around the monstrous cathedral , barking . And , if it was a Christmas Eve , while the great bell , which seemed to emit the death rattle , summoned the faithful to the midnight mass , such an air was spread over the sombre façade that one would have declared that the grand portal was devouring the throng , and that the rose window was watching it . And all this came from Quasimodo . Egypt would have taken him for the god of this temple ; the Middle Ages believed him to be its demon : he was in fact its soul . To such an extent was this disease that for those who know that Quasimodo has existed , Notre-Dame is to-day deserted , inanimate , dead . One feels that something has disappeared from it . That immense body is empty ; it is a skeleton ; the spirit has quitted it , one sees its place and that is all . It is like a skull which still has holes for the eyes , but no longer sight . </doc>

1369,A12,"Graft Placement By the time , the donor area has been closed , there are enough grafts already prepared to begin placing the grafts according to Dr. Simmons and Dr. McKenzie's detailed plan . While those grafts are being placed , more grafts are being prepared . Thus grafts will be prepared and placed simultaneously . For the vast majority of our patients the "" stick-and-place method "" is used . A fine needle is used to create a tiny hole ( which is actually a miniature tunnel ) in Dr. Simmons and Dr. McKenzie's specified angle and direction . A follicular unit graft is then held gently by the protective tissue surrounding the follicular structures and immediately tucked into the newly created opening . The stick-and-place offers many advantages compared to the method employed at most facilities . Many facilities make all the recipient sites first then place the grafts . Since skin is elastic , the holes start shrinking almost immediately after they are made . Smaller holes are required for the stick-and-place method since they can be filled before they shrink . Smaller holes in turn cause less damage to the skin or the blood supply and the holes can be made closer together than larger holes . Using the stick-and-place method also eliminates the risk of leaving holes unfilled or accidentally "" piggy-backing "" two grafts into the same opening . Finally , using the stick-and-place method gives Dr. Simmons and Dr. McKenzie flexibility to modify the plan as needed as the procedure continues whereas if the holes are all made in advance , the plan can not be adapted according to scalp or hair characteristics afterward . With the older , more conventional mini-graft technique , space must be left between the grafts to ensure proper blood flow , providing the essential supply of blood for grafts to grow . If the grafts are larger , more space has to be left in between . The number of grafts one can transplant at each session is therefore limited . A fewer number of grafts will , therefore , be transplanted at every session . Also , with mini-grafts , a second and often a third and fourth session are usually necessary to fill these spaces left for the blood flow in between these grafts . These extra sessions are also necessary to minimize the tufted "" toothbrush "" or "" cornrow "" appearance - and also , to add density . However , with Dr. Simmons and Dr. McKenzie's "" All Follicular Unit Mega session "" , the grafts are so small and placed into such minute pinprick sized holes , that they disturb the blood circulation much less . These smaller grafts can be "" dense-packed "" , extremely close together . As these grafts are packed so densely , the density of the hair that grows back is usually enough to satisfy most patients after just one session . </doc>

597,A22,"Hallucinations , a blog about writing , trains , and Wire to Wire Viewing Entries From : January 2013 Sometimes it 's too cold to write in the treehouse . Even in the low 40s , the space heater will warm it up pretty good . But when the temperature drops below that , I write inside . A few weeks ago , the Sucker Lake News ( I think that 's what the publication is called ) did a nice little story on the grant I won and ran a picture of my indoor writing space . You can see the conga that I keep to my right , in case any time needs to be wasted playing repetitive rhythms . ( The photographer placed a copy of W2W on top of the drum . When I first got the conga , I made a hard and fast rule that it would never be used as a table . It 's a musical instrument , after all , and nothing should be placed on top of it . I make exceptions for books , CDs , unopened mail , dirty clothes , power cords , credit card receipts , manuscript pages , notebooks , tax files , hats , postcards , stuff I 've brought home from work , and other , smaller drums . However , I draw the line at placing dirty dishes on top of the conga . Those go on the floor . ) What you ca n't see in the photo are all the other , uh .. totems that I keep on my desk for good luck or inspiration . The treehouse desk , by necessity , is bare . It 's too small to collect crap . But the indoor writing space is a magnet for that kind of stuff . So for the next few blog entries , I thought I 'd share some pictures of a few things I keep around me . Starting with these . These two tin plates are Loteria pictograms I got from Tesoros in Austin . La Calavera is The Skull , although to me the image is more about death . El Corazon is The Heart . These are on the shelf right in front of me , and I look up at them frequently when I get stuck . Basically they tell me , Remember that the stakes are high . Remember to write from the heart . I need to remind myself of that a lot . Laura Stanfill is a novelist , editor , blogger , and founder of Forest Avenue Press . She 's also the force behind Brave on the Page , an anthology featuring 42 Oregon authors sharing their thoughts on craft and creativity . A couple weeks ago , Laura pulled off an amazing event at Powell's City of Books in Portland , drawing 150 people on a Monday night to hear nine Brave on the Page contributers . The evening was a blast , featuring readings and a panel discussion . I was proud to be part of it , ( despite the fact that there was a lot of talk on the panel about me not knowing how women pee when they 're in the shower , posture-wise . I promise to get that right in my next book . ) Laura has a recap of the evening here that I wo n't repeat , but you should check it out along with the rest of her site . And writer and designer Gigi Little , who read at the event , summed it up this way : "" I think Laura Stanfill has something really special going with Forest Avenue Press , and the support she 's gotten says loads about not only Powell's and the writing community in Portland but also - and most of all - Laura's energy , ingenuity , and smarts . "" I just want to second that -- especially the part about energy , ingenuity , and smarts . Thanks , Laura , for having the vision to imagine Brave on the Page in the first place . And for all the hard work and creativity involved in making it real . Brave on the Page at Powell's : From left , Yuvi Zalkow , Joanna Rose , Jon Bell , Gigi Little , Robert Hill , Laura Stanfill , Kristy Athens , and me . ( Not pictured , Gina Ochsner and Kate Gray . ) The next Brave on the Page event is at The Artist Edge Salon in Sandy , Oregon on January 27 , with the terrific lineup of Laura , Stevan Allred , Martha Ragland and Liz Prato . If you 're in Oregon , do n't miss it . Confession : I used to be a big Survivor fan . When Zane was young , we 'd watch as a family . Sure , each show had a healthy dose of reality-show hoo-hah , but there was also strategy involved . Each week , we 'd have some good pre - and post-show debates about whose mojo was working and who was toast . The craziest part of every season was always the final tribal council , when the two remaining survivors had to answer questions from the outcasts . Inevitably , one of the questions would be , Why do you deserve to be in the final two ? In the four seasons I watched , no one ever answered that question honestly . The responses always had to do with playing the game fair but hard , being true to their values , etc. , etc. No finalist ever looked at the camera and admitted what was glaringly obvious : I got lucky . I could 've been voted off a bunch of times , but the key challenges broke my way , and things worked out . Instead , it was always about their work ethic or their dedication . In the living room , I 'd be calling the posers out . "" C ' mon , man . It 's 60 , 70 , maybe 80 percent luck . You stumbled on the Immunity Idol ! Michael fell in the fire ! That 's called catching a break . Just say it . "" And that pretty much sums up how I feel about being awarded an Artist Fellowship by the Oregon Arts Commission recently . I 'm honored , of course . Very much so . And yes , I was dedicated and played the game fair but hard , etc. , etc. But so did a whole lot of other very talented people . This time around , I was the one who caught the break . Next time , someone else . Like with a lot of things , you put your name in , and sometimes you get selected . Or as Zane used to say , back when we were handicapping survivors , life is unfair , but sometimes it 's unfair in your favor . The Fellowship will help me as I take some time off to work on Dogs Run Free . And the recognition means a great deal to me . Saying that I know I got lucky does n't mean I do n't take it seriously . It means I 'll work hard to live up to it . You better watch what you do . "" You Got Lucky "" by Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers . </doc>

5,A1,"China's Gift to Europe Europeans are wrong to be angry with China because its currency peg to the US dollar has boosted the euro against most currencies on foreign exchange markets . On the contrary , they should view the currency peg as a valuable gift . In New York and other American cities , European shoppers are on a spree . They 're enjoying first hand the euro's enhanced purchasing power abroad . The currency peg has also helped make the euro into an important reserve currency , rivaling the dollar . Investments from all over the world are flowing into Europe as a result . It was predictable that China's currency peg would have this effect . It forced China to accumulate huge amounts of dollars to stabilize its currency and gave the euro an extra boost as the dollar depreciated . To protect itself from the declining greenback , China and other countries are converting a portion of their accumulated dollar reserves into euros . The International Monetary Fund estimates that the euro's share of foreign exchange reserves rose to 26.4 percent in third quarter of 2007 from 25.5 percent in the second quarter of 2007 , and 24.4 percent in the third quarter of 2006 . The euro 's becoming a major reserve currency bestows important economic advantages on the euro-zone economy . Europeans should thank the Chinese currency peg for the part it is playing in this . Of course , with an augmented supply of euros , China can be expected to make substantial investments in Europe , which also is a good thing , especially since , in the United States at least , China has demonstrated a preference for investments in financial institutions rocked by the sub-prime crisis . Europe has plenty of those . So far , China's biggest European investment has been in the Belgian financial company , Fortis N. V. , where Ping An Insurance recently acquired a 4.2 % stake , making it the largest shareholder in the company . China Development Bank also made an investment in Barclays to bolster its bid for ABN AMRO which , though it failed , helped the Dutch bank get the full value for its assets . This is only a start . Merrill Lynch predicts that , as currency reserves climb in countries like China , state-run investment funds will grow to $ 7 . 9 trillion , from $ 1 . 9 trillion now . China's currency peg has also come in handy for Europe in its fight to keep inflation in check , while its monetary policy remains constrained by the sub-prime crisis . Experts estimate that , in terms of guarding against inflation , the euro's appreciation has been equivalent to about 35 basis points rise in the interest rate . The strong euro has helped insulate Europe from skyrocketing oil and commodity prices , which are priced in dollars on the world markets . The big downside of the currency peg for Europe is supposed to be exports . That 's what sent French President Nicolas Sarkozy and other high-level European officials scurrying off to China last November – and why many ordinary Europeans continue to think of the Chinese as not playing by the rules . This is protectionist thinking par excellence . What makes exports so special ? Why are they more important than cheap imports or the bargains that European shoppers get in New York ? Should Europe give up all the advantages of the currency peg just because it makes European exports more expensive ? Of course not ! Note that it was French President Sarkozy who went to China to protest the currency peg , not German Chancellor Angela Merkel . German exports are not being substantially damaged by the strong euro – indeed , German costs are so competitive that exporters are confident they can cope with the euro at 1.50 dollars and even higher . This is not true for France -- but the answer is obvious : reduce costs and France too will be able to cope with the strong euro . In the final analysis , cutting costs is all the Europeans can do if they want to preserve the competitiveness of their exports . The Chinese are not going to change their exchange rate regime , which has strategic as well as economic motivations , just because the Europeans are unhappy with the currency peg . China has given the Europeans a gift . They should be grateful , rather than foolishly insist that China take it back . </doc>

1407,A7,"Finding a Quality West Highland Terrier Breeder A quality breeder may be difficult to find on many occasions because it is rather easy to breed these small dogs and even easier to get them passed as whatever breed you would prefer , including the West Highland White Terrier . Hence , it would take a real effort to find out about which of the hundreds of breeders out there is actually a quality West Highland Terrier breeder . Interview the West Highland Terrier Breeder and Look for the Right Signs 1 . A quality breeder will ordinarily have the puppies within their house , and not a demarcated area outside the normal living quarters . These dogs need to be socialized early in their life , and if they do not get it at the right time , they might develop as aggressive animals . A good West Highland Terrier breeder will know this , and have them socialized very early in life . 2 . These dogs are very temperamental initially . They need to be trained early and with consistence , so ' good manners ' become part of their nature . A good breeder will either have them trained , or if you are taking them away too early , warn you about this requirement . 3 . A quality West Highland Terrier breeder is very proud and possessive about his brood . He / she will be very reluctant to let go of their puppies until they are more than assured that you are the best possible owner for it . Be prepared to be interviewed at length and visited at home as well . The quality breeder will look forward to develop a relationship with you so it will be able to keep a tab on its puppy . 4 . A quality breeder will ask you to sign a contract which binds you to return the puppy ( or adult ) West Highland Terrier if for any reason whatsoever , you would not be able to take care of it any longer . The breeder will never take a chance of having their dogs end in a rescue animal shelter . 5 . A good quality breeder will have all the necessary documentation ready regarding the bitch pedigree , the stud 's as well as the medical reports showing that it does not suffer from any genetic defects . It will also have proof that the female is healthy . 6 . The female would not be younger than two years if the present litter is the first one , and the total number of litters should not exceed four over its whole life span . The female and the puppies should look happy and comfortable with their surroundings and your presence . </doc>

748,A1,"What is the North East Local Biodiversity Partnership ? The North East Local Biodiversity Partnership was formed in 1996 from a wide range of statutory and voluntary agencies and individuals with a common interest in conserving biodiversity . The local authorities involved in the North East Local Biodiversity Action Partnership are Aberdeenshire Council , Aberdeen City Council and Moray Council . The government agencies , non-statutory and voluntary organisations that have an active role in the partnership are Scottish Natural Heritage , Forestry Commission , Scottish Landowners Federation , National Farmers Union of Scotland , Royal Society for the Protection of Birds , University of Aberdeen . There are also a number of individuals that contribute to the running of the North East Local Biodiversity Partnership . The aim of the partnership is to protect and enhance the local biodiversity of the area by developing and implementing the Local Biodiversity Action Plan ( LBAP ) . A Local Biodiversity Action Plan Steering Group was established to co-ordinate the production of a series of action plans for the North East of Scotland . These action plans identify a range of species , habitats and areas that are considered important locally and nationally and require action to ensure their protection . A number of these action plans can be found on this web site . The Local Biodiversity Action Plan is designed to fit into a national and international programme designed to enhance biodiversity globally . What is biodiversity ? Biodiversity , shorthand for biological diversity , can be defined as "" the variety of life , the great richness of living things in the natural world "" . Biodiversity conservation is about sustaining and using wisely the whole variety of life . The careful use of land and natural resources is one of the most important influences on the abundance and variety of animals and plants sharing our environment . What is an action plan ? An Action Plan is a working document that is used by local organisations and Local Biodiversity Action Plan Partners . Action plans layout the measures needed for the protection of habitat , species or areas in the North East area . A local action plan is designed to protect and enhance local and national priority species , habitats and areas . It is a detailed five year plan specifying the actions required to meet proposed objectives and targets . Action plans are accessible to a wide range of people , from those in lead organisations , such as Councils , to individuals with an interest in the environment . Action plans are written by volunteers with a particular research interest or knowledge of a particular species , habitat or area . Once a first draft of the action plan has been compiled a consultation process takes place by a working group of stakeholders in the plan . The plan is subsequently published , implemented and periodically reviewed . The current action plans for the North East can be found on this web site ( Click Here to View the Action Plans ) Why do we need to protect and enhance local and national priority habitat , species and areas ? We need to protect and enhance local and national priority species , habitats and areas of the North East in order to maintain the biodiversity of this area . Biodiversity is essential to our existence on this planet . Without the intricate network of biological systems , habitats and species the support systems that sustain human existence would cease to continue . It is important to realise that biodiversity is the dynamic interrelationship of living species and communities operating together to produce living habitats and ecosystems . The loss of one species can have serious knock on effects that are hard to predict . Individual losses of species or habitats are likely to precipitate further losses or at least a general decline in the biodiversity . We must conserve the variety and richness of life on earth for our own enjoyment and quality of life . We also have a moral obligation to pass on to the next generation an environment that is healthy and intact . Regrettably we have already lost many species from our countryside but we can not allow any more to reach the point of extinction . Biodiversity is the variety of life , the rich assembly of living things in the natural world . Biodiversity includes all living things and their environments , from the tiniest flying insect to the tallest tree , from open expanses of coastline to the smallest urban garden . Biodiversity is found everywhere . We are part if biodiversity and depend on it for our quality of life . Biodiversity involves everyone , it supports us , it is our vital for our survival . </doc>

1577,A1,"Old Age or New Age Thinker ? What ways can we prepare for and survive the Prescription Perfect Storm ® ? My academic colleagues offer that depending on our age , we were offered different ways to learn ... and think ... about many decisions or key choices . It ties back to whether we learned to remember or become creative using the just learned new information or content ( academics know this as Bloom's Taxonomy ) . Folks who preceded the pharmacy automated dispensing age of this century did learn differently ... to think and assess . Where you born before 1945 ? Before 1975 ? Before 1995 ? Generation X ? Generation Y ? Sorry to offer , but each of these age groups access key financial decisions ( among other things ) differently . In the present , regardless of how we learned or were "" taught "" , we all are challenged the same with the latest healthcare mandates . How are we to work to improve our pharmacy workflow , cash flow and business success . Hummm ... Should we automate ? Major Pharmacy Chains and Hospital Systems Are Already Gearing Up Despite the infighting presently occurring in the legislature over this new change in healthcare coverage , the challenges presented by the influx of newly insured patients poses a clear and present danger to already taxed pharmacy resources . This train is leaving the station ! It has been reported that major pharmacy chains such as Walgreens , CVS , Rite Aid and Walmart are setting up trained "" insurance specialists "" to assist patients with new plan enrollments for the October 1 st rollout . Furthermore , another recent article suggested that hospital systems will play a major role in the patient enrollment with extensive community outreach and patient education programs for patient enrollments . The first wave of open enrollment will commence on Oct 1 st for a duration of six months . You can consider this Medicare Part D , Deux ! Still Riding the Fence ? I 'm still trying to decide as a pharmacy consultant how I offer to my clients in community pharmacies , community health care clinics , medical home alliances and skilled nursing facilities the best way ( s ) for them to prepare for the Prescription Perfect Storm ® . It 's difficult to not recommend automated pharmacy dispensing systems as one of the answers . Earlier studies demonstrated that savings of up to 40-50 minutes / hour can occur from use of an automated pharmacy dispensing system . If any pharmacy needs complete an additional 100 new prescriptions daily , these studies suggested the need for an additional 400 minutes per day to complete the inputting / filling / dispensing / approval process . At what cost with additional staff completing manual dispensing ? At what cost with various options of pharmacy automated dispensing systems ? When automated pharmacy dispensing systems are thought of as "" human resources "" ... and their impact on quick pharmacy automated dispensing system ROI ... it just seems logical that this needs the preferred recommendation . Using a 10 or 12 hour day for involvement use of a robotic "" human resource "" , the hourly wage for implementation is less than $ 1-9 / hour depending upon the system chosen ... assuming photo verification of medication "" in the vial "" exists . These costs for additional "" robotic pharmacy human resources "" are less expensive than recommending additional traditional human resources , such as additional technicians , and the associated salary and benefits typically expected . Work the numbers ... it 's a "" no-brainer "" I sense . Automated Dispensing Systems Should Be Considered a "" Human Resource "" I 've interviewed or spoken with many pharmacy owners w ho know the addition of an automated dispensing system was quickly embraced by their staff as another human resource . In my pharmacy experience , a major excitement is naming the new "" baby "" . Time to start asking your staff to name yours ? They will appreciate your decision to help support them in the forthcoming Prescription Perfect Storm ® . </doc>

638,A11,"Personal stories - Leigh I was diagnosed over 14 years ago now and I was in Holloway for the third time . I was on remand for drug related crime . I think it was for cheque book fraud . I had been tested for HIV before I went in to prison because my boyfriend had found out he was positive . He 'd been very ill and subsequently got his diagnosis . I went for a test but when the results were due , I was already inside . I told the prison about it . I felt that I should . It was an incredibly scary time . It was January 1987 and all I really knew about HIV was what I saw on TV . At the time they were doing that national campaign with tomb stones and HIV = AIDS = Death . Even though I was an intravenous drug user , at that point I did not know anybody else with HIV apart from my boyfriend , so when I was given the results it was still an incredible shock . I was told not to talk about it because they did not want mass hysteria and I was put into isolation . They told me that if anybody were to ask me why , I was to say it was because I had Hepatitis B. I did see someone after being told my test result , for about two minutes . I ca n't remember much about it other than sitting there crying . The only good thing about it was that she offered me a fag . I was not given any information about HIV or AIDS . I just thought that I was going to die pretty soon . At this time I got very ill . I was only seven stone anyway and was withdrawing off heroin . But I think the shock of it gave me really severe gastroenteritis . There was nobody to talk to . Nobody was allowed near me and my food was passed through a hatch . Then , I had to go to court to try and get bail . I did n't get it . The way the prison system works is that you do not then automatically go back into Holloway Prison . I was put into a holding cell in a police station and there , again , nobody was allowed near me . There were a few other people in these cells and I told one of the girls there what had happened . She told the police that I needed some help . I was really sick , but they would n't help me . They eventually sent me back to Holloway , into the hospital bit where I was put into a room with two other people who had just been diagnosed in my absence . So there were three of us together which was a bit better . At least that was some support . But still , the same rule applied ; nobody else was allowed to come near us . I then tried for bail again . At the court I was put into a cubicle instead of the main waiting room with all the other girls . I could hear the Police and prison officers coming in and refusing to take me , saying they had heard about me : "" She 's the one with AIDS and the last van and the last cell she was in had to be fumigated "" ... So the whole experience was sitting there , hearing people talk about the girl with AIDS but nobody actually talking to me about it . After sitting in this tiny cubicle with a closed door for six hours , I eventually got taken in to court . I did get bail . The one good thing that came out of this whole horrific experience was that I really thought hard about my life for the first time ever , I guess because I thought I was going to die . I accepted this but knew one thing : I did not want to die a junkie or in a prison cell , or a victim . That was the first time that anything had come in to my life to make me look at it and change it around . When I came out of prison , I had some really bad experiences . My family were really scared . They did n't know any different . I hasten to add that they are incredibly supportive now and have been for years but at the time they did not want to even pick up their Christmas presents . When I dropped them off , my brother in law asked me not to touch the children . We had bricks thrown through our windows on the estate where I lived with my boyfriend . I 'd told one person , a fellow drug user , thinking they would realise that it could have easily happened to them . I had no idea of the consequences of telling people . Suddenly , everybody knew . We 'd go out to the shops and kids would chant ' Oh , they 're the ones with AIDS . ' People snubbed us . As far as my drug taking was concerned , I went on a methadone prescription but although I had this mini - revelation in prison , it still took me a couple of years to change my life . I was on this script and was just waiting to die really . I did go to a couple of support groups . There was one at Body Positive but I was always the only woman . I remember seeing an AIDS specialist for the first time and asking him how long I had to live . He said he did n't know but he was sure that I stood a better chance if I stopped taking street drugs . At that point I had not stopped taking drugs completely but I 'd certainly cut down and had started to put on a bit of weight . I actually went to my hospital appointments regularly and went to the DDU ( Drug Dependency Unit ) . But my life was worse than it had been because before , it had been a full time job being a junkie , however horrific it was . The last two years had just consisted of getting up , going to the chemist , getting my prescription and that was it . So one day I woke up and knew I just had to stop taking drugs completely . I went into a 12 step treatment centre . Their philosophy was total abstinence and they encouraged me to go to Narcotics Anonymous meetings . I remember the first group that I went to . You have to say : .. "" Hello , my name is .... and I 'm an addict ' and I said .. "" Hello , my name is Leigh . I 'm an addict and I 'm also HIV + . "" I thought I had to be out in the open and I automatically said .. "" So you can all leave the room now . "" ... because that was my experience . Nobody did . They hugged me and it was really nice and I felt really accepted . But that , too , was like a double edged sword . We used to have therapeutic duties to do and one was serving food . I was banned from the kitchen . I did n't mind because I did n't want to peel potatoes but I was confused about being accepted one minute and the next being treated very differently . Quite frankly , without the drugs to cushion it all , being on the programme felt like being diagnosed all over again . But I got through it and then went to a half way house . I got through that too , and from there my life began to change . The reason I got involved with working for AIDS organisations was because of my anger at how I had been treated . I started working at PW in 1991 which was a very empowering experience for me . I had never had my own cheque book before so that was a novelty ! The experience of being responsible , helping other people and contributing helped me to learn and grow . I left PW after three years , as the Services Manager . The main reason was the death of Jaynie , one of the founder members . I went to her funeral and she left a letter saying she was dying really happy . I thought , at the time , in terms of maybe only having a couple of years left . I could n't say that if I died I would be happy . I was burned out and stressed out from working all the time . So I left to have some time for me . </doc>

1350,A16,"Domestic Violence - A Workplace Issue She was one of the top customer service reps in the company . To her coworkers , Suzanne seemed to have it all - a doting husband , children , a lovely home and a successful career . Every night at the end of her shift , her husband was waiting outside in their car for her , and she was out the door promptly at five . One day her manager approached her just before quitting time and asked to speak with her in his office . She became flustered and asked if it could n't wait until the next day . He shrugged her off . "" It 'll only take a few minutes . I wo n't keep you long . "" He was true to his word but when Suzanne opened the door to leave her manager's office , her fuming husband was standing there . He ordered her to go to the car . What Suzanne's colleagues did n't know was that she spent the following two days being insulted , assaulted and locked in her own bedroom , all at the hands of her "" devoted "" husband . What is domestic violence ? Domestic violence ( also called battering or intimate partner violence ) is a pattern of abusive behaviour used by a person to gain power and control over his or her partner in an intimate relationship . The abusive behaviour can include intimidation , verbal abuse , emotional attacks , threats or use of violence , sexual assault , and homicide . The batterer may also use other means to control his or her victim , such as controlling finances , interfering in the victim's work , isolation , limited or no communication , blaming , apologies , promises to change and gifts . Victims of domestic violence come from all walks of life , however the majority are women . The SafeWork website reports that in the United States , 1 in 3 women will report being physically or sexually abused by a husband or boyfriend at some point in their lives . Domestic violence tends to become more severe over time with the highest number of assaults and homicides occurring after victims leave their abusive partners . So why is domestic violence a workplace issue ? When a victim leaves the abusive relationship , the abuser knows that the one place the victim can be found is at work . Ten signs of domestic violence If you suspect that one of your employees or colleagues may be in an abusive relationship , look for a pattern of these signs : Injuries such as bruises , black eyes , or broken bones with no , or unlikely explanations such as blaming the injuries on falls or being clumsy Large number of phone calls , emails , and texts from a current or former partner and reluctance to respond to them Disruptive visits to work by current or former partner What employers can do As an employer , you have the power to keep your employees safe at work . Ultimately , this will also protect your community as well as your company's bottom line . You can start by developing a domestic violence policy . You can also train your managers , supervisors and all employees about proper response steps , and raise awareness about the issue . Train managers and supervisors to : recognize - be aware of signs of violence for potential victims and abusers refer - know who to call internally and externally if a situation of domestic violence becomes known Training should include issues of privacy and confidentiality . Start a program in your workplace to address domestic violence : Make prevention of and response to domestic violence part of your workplace violence prevention program . Create awareness by talking about domestic violence with your employees . Communicate that your workplace is a safe environment for them to reach out for help with domestic violence . Provide employees with information on how to recognize the signs of a troublesome or abusive relationship so they know when to seek assistance for themselves or for co-workers . Make information on counseling and support resources available both inside and outside the organization . Educate employees regarding security procedures available to keep themselves and others safe in the workplace , including where and how to report a potential threat and how to avoid unintentionally giving the abuser access to the victim . remove the employee's name and phone number from automated phone messages or directories ; do n't give out any employee's personal information to others ; ensure the employee knows the specifics of your workplace policy and how to report any incident or threat ; rework the employee's work assignment or schedule . Develop an effective workplace response to domestic violence that includes an organizational safety plan as well as working with victims to develop individualized workplace safety plans . Domestic violence is a workplace issue . In April 2009 Ontario tabled Bill 168 , an act to amend the Occupational Health and Safety Act . The proposed bill specifically addressed the issue of domestic violence in the workplace by requiring Ontario employers to "" take every precaution reasonable in the circumstances "" to protect workers from domestic violence that would likely cause physical injury to workers in the workplace . This obligation on the employer arises only if the employer is - or should be - aware of the situation . What constitutes "" domestic violence "" is not defined . The new legislation is expected to be passed in the Fall 2009 . Hazard Alerts Print this article Lead in the Workplace Last year , some childhood lead poisonings in Maine came from an unusual source . Parents got lead dust on their clothes at work and then carried it into their cars , inadvertently exposing their children . Workers can be exposed to lead in the workplace by inhaling fumes and dusts , or by accidentally ingesting it from lead-contaminated hands , food , drinks , cosmetics , tobacco products , and clothing . As in the case of the family in Maine , workers can take lead home on their clothes , skin , hair , tools , and in their vehicles , potentially exposing their families to harmful health effects . In an updated health and safety bulletin , Work Safe Alberta offers guidance on lead in the workplace and how to protect workers and their families from lead exposure . Lead exposure Until the 1980s , the main sources of lead exposure for Canadians were lead paint and emissions from cars using leaded gasoline ( which stopped in Canada in 1990 , except for some specific types of vehicles ) . Today lead is used in many of the following products : batteries lead shielding for x-rays crystal ceramics and pottery glazes stained glass lead solder - used in water pipes in older homes , electronics , radiator shops cosmetics - many of the pigments and other substances used in cosmetics contain lead pesticides ( lead arsenate ) ammunition lead weights and tools electroplating glass in computer monitors Occupations with lead exposure risks include : Cable splicing Construction Manufacturing of ammunition , ceramics , electrical components , pottery and lead batteries Stained glass Mining Painting Radiator repair Recovery of gold and silver Repair and reclamation of lead batteries Smelting Welding Health effects The most common ways that workers are exposed to lead are inhalation of airborne lead dust or fumes and accidental ingestion . Workers ingest lead by touching the face and handling cigarettes or food when their hands are contaminated with lead . About 5 to 15 percent of the lead an adult ingests is absorbed into their body . Lead is not normally absorbed through the skin unless there is a break in the skin such as a cut or scrape . Symptoms of acute lead poisoning include headache , excessive tiredness , nausea , abdominal cramps , and joint pain . Other effects such as a metallic taste in the mouth , vomiting and constipation or bloody diarrhea can also occur . Harmful effects due to short-term exposure to inorganic lead compounds are rarely seen any more because of strict controls used in workplaces where lead exposure might occur . However , lead accumulates in the body where it can be stored for decades and released back into the blood long after the original exposure . Inorganic lead compounds are well known to cause significant health effects following long-term ( chronic ) exposure , including effects on the : Reproductive system ( causing effects on fertility and developmental effects in children ) Nervous system Digestive system Cardiovascular and blood system Kidneys Work Safe Alberta's health and safety bulletin provides greater detail on the health effects as well as information on managing lead in the workplace , exposure levels , monitoring methods , and preventive measures .

437,A7,"MSDS are documents describing the known hazards associated with a material , indicating safe handling procedures and recommending responses to accidents and thus are invaluable sources of safety information . They are prepared by the chemical suppliers and by UK law must be sent to you if you buy a chemical ( CHIP2 ) but can be requested even if you are only thinking of buying . If you already have the chemical but the MSDS is lost or the material is so old that none came with it , most manufacturers are happy to Fax a relevant MSDS on request . Many even make compilations of their data sheets available free of charge . If you order a chemical , you are strongly advised to read the MSDS that comes with it and to file it away in a safe place for future reference . A laboratory library of MSDS relevant to the chemicals kept there constitutes a valuable safety resource . ( In the United States the law requires that MSDS be kept available for all materials in an establishment . ) How to read an MSDS First of all , the MSDS from different manufacturers are usually different in layout and the amount of detail they give . However a typical MSDS delivered in the UK will contain ( this is taken from the Fisons model ) the chemical name of the compound and its CAS Number ( Chemical Abstracts Number ) , perhaps some other identifying number , a product code and the name of the supplier . If the material is a mixture , its composition will be given . Regulatory information is often given in terms of Risk Phrases and Safety Phrases . Risk Phrases , e . g . R26 , consists of R followed by a number , in this case indicating that the material is "" toxic by inhalation "" and the Safety Phrases e . g . S29 "" do not empty down the drain "" . ( It is not necessary to know what all the Risk or Safety Phrases mean since they are usually quoted alongside their code . ) Hazard information will typically outline the main hazards of the material followed by fire fighting measures , First Aid measures , accidental release measures , handling and storage precautions , how stable is the material , and what protect ion clothing to wear , etc. There may be some description of the physical and chemical properties of the material and also toxicological information , ecological information and advice on disposal . All of this information is supplied and some people deliver it straight into the bin ! How to find an MSDS If you want to have this information e . g . for completing a COSHH assessment but you do n't have the MSDS what can you do ? The simplest thing is to ask the manufacturer for a copy . Some you do n't even have to ask since they publish free compilations of their sheets although this is now happening less . ( The set of BDH Hazard Sheets kept in the Worsley Library is no longer produced ) . The DSA has sets of sheets from Fisons and from Fishers on diskette which are available on request , the University Safety Office has an extensive and more general database and the very large Sigma-Aldrich set exists within the University . Otherwise there are now a large number of FREE sources on the Internet and some are outlined below . Vermont Safety Site has a huge collection MSDS Online - search for a chemical and this site will provide the links to connect to the data .

96,A1,"My work is about the behaviors that we all engage in unconsciously , on a collective level . And what I mean by that , it 's the behaviors that we 're in denial about , and the ones that operate below the surface of our daily awareness . And as individuals , we all do these things , all the time , everyday . It 's like when you 're mean to your wife because you 're mad at somebody else . Or when you drink a little too much at a party just out of anxiety . Or when you overeat because your feelings are hurt , or whatever . And when we do these kind of things , when 300 million people do unconscious behaviors , then it can add up to a catastrophic consequence that nobody wants , and no one intended . And that 's what I look at with my photographic work . This is an image I just recently completed , that is , when you stand back at a distance , it looks like some kind of neo-gothic , cartoon image of a factory spewing out pollution . And as you get a little bit closer , it starts looking like lots of pipes , like maybe a chemical plant , or a refinery , or maybe a hellish freeway interchange . And as you get all the way up close , you realize that it 's actually made of lots and lots of plastic cups . And in fact , this is one million plastic cups , which is the number of plastic cups that are used on airline flights in the United States every six hours . We use four million cups a day on airline flights , and virtually none of them are reused or recycled ; they just do n't do that in that industry . Now that number is dwarfed by the number of paper cups we use every day , and that is 40 million cups a day for hot beverages , most of which is coffee . I could n ' t fit 40 million cups on a canvas , but I was able to put 410,000 . That 's what 410,000 cups looks like . That 's 15 minutes of our cup consumption . And if you could actually stack up that many cups in real life , that 's the size it would be . And there 's an hour's worth of our cups . And there 's a day's worth of our cups . You can still see the little people way down there . That 's as high as a 42-story building , and I put the Statue of Liberty in there as a scale reference . Speaking of justice , there 's another phenomenon going on in our culture that I find deeply troubling , and that is that America right now has the largest percentage of its population in prison of any country on Earth . One out of four people , one out of four humans in prison are Americans , imprisoned in our country . And I wanted to show the number . The number is 2.3 million Americans were incarcerated in 2005 . And that 's gone up since then , but we do n't have the numbers yet . So I wanted to show 2.3 million prison uniforms , and in the actual print of this piece , each uniform is the size of a nickel on its edge . They 're tiny , they 're barely visible as a piece of material , and to show 2.3 million of them required a canvas that was larger than any printer in the world would print . And so I had to divide it up into multiple panels that are 10 feet tall by 25 feet wide . This is that piece installed in a gallery in New York ; those are my parents looking at the piece . ( Laughter ) Every time I look at this piece , I always wonder if my mom 's whispering to my dad , "" He finally folded his laundry . "" ( Laughter ) I want to show you some pieces now that are about addiction . And this particular one is about cigarette addiction . I wanted to make a piece that shows the actual number of Americans who die from cigarette smoking . More than 400,000 people die in the United States every year from smoking cigarettes . And so this piece is made up of lots and lots of boxes of cigarettes . And , as you slowly step back , you see that it 's a painting by Van Gogh , called "" Skull with Cigarette . "" It 's a strange thing to think about , that on 9 / 11 , when that tragedy happened , 3,000 Americans died , and do you remember the response ? It reverberated around the world , and will continue to reverberate through time . It will be something that we talk about in 100 years . And yet on that same day , 1,100 Americans died from smoking . And the day after that , another 1,100 Americans died from smoking . And every single day since then , 1,100 Americans have died , and today , 1,100 Americans are dying from cigarette smoking . And we are n ' t talking about it ; we dismiss it . The tobacco lobby , it 's too strong . We just dismiss it out of our consciousness . And knowing what we know about the destructive power of cigarettes , we continue to allow our children , our sons and daughters , to be in the presence of the influences that start them smoking . And this is what the next piece is about . This is just lots and lots of cigarettes : 65,000 cigarettes , which is equal to the number of teenagers who will start smoking this month , and every month in the US . More than 700,000 children in the United States aged 18 and under begin smoking every year . One more strange epidemic in the United States that I want to acquaint you with is this phenomenon of abuse and misuse of prescription drugs . This is an image I 've made out of lots and lots of Vicodin -- well , actually I only had one Vicodin that I scanned lots and lots of times . ( Laughter ) And so as you stand back you see 213,000 Vicodin pills , which is the number of hospital emergency room visits yearly in the United States , attributable to abuse and misuse of prescription painkillers and anti-anxiety medications . One-third of all drug overdoses in the U. S. -- and that includes cocaine , heroin , alcohol , everything -- one-third of drug overdoses are prescription medications . A strange phenomenon . This is a piece that I just recently completed about another tragic phenomenon . And that is the phenomenon , this growing obsession we have with breast augmentation surgery . 384,000 women , American women , last year went in for elective breast augmentation surgery . It 's rapidly becoming the most popular high school graduation gift , given to young girls who are about to go off to college . So I made this image out of Barbie dolls , and so as you stand back you see this kind of floral pattern , and as you get all the way back , you see 32,000 Barbie dolls , which represents the number of breast augmentation surgeries that are performed in the U. S. each month . The vast majority of those are on women under the age of 21 . And strangely enough , the only plastic surgery that is more popular than breast augmentation is liposuction , and most of that is being done by men . Now , I want to emphasize that these are just examples . I 'm not holding these out as being the biggest issues . They 're just examples . And the reason that I do this , it 's because I have this fear that we are n ' t feeling enough as a culture right now . There 's this kind of anesthesia in America at the moment . We 've lost our sense of outrage , our anger and our grief about what 's going on in our culture right now , what 's going on in our country , the atrocities that are being committed in our names around the world . They 've gone missing ; these feelings have gone missing . Our cultural joy , our national joy is nowhere to be seen . And one of the causes of this , I think , is that as each of us attempts to build this new kind of world view , this holoptical world view , this holographic image that we 're all trying to create in our mind of the inter-connection of things : the environmental footprints 1,000 miles away of the things that we buy ; the social consequences 10,000 miles away of the daily decisions that we make as consumers . As we try to build this view , and try to educate ourselves about the enormity of our culture , the information that we have to work with is these gigantic numbers : numbers in the millions , in the hundreds of millions , in the billions and now in the trillions . Bush's new budget is in the trillions , and these are numbers that our brain just does n ' t have the ability to comprehend . We ca n ' t make meaning out of these enormous statistics . And so that 's what I 'm trying to do with my work , is to take these numbers , these statistics from the raw language of data , and to translate them into a more universal visual language , that can be felt . Because my belief is , if we can feel these issues , if we can feel these things more deeply , then they 'll matter to us more than they do now . And if we can find that , then we 'll be able to find within each one of us what it is that we need to find to face the big question , which is : How do we change ? That , to me , is the big question that we face as a people right now : How do we change ? How do we change as a culture , and how do we each individually take responsibility for the one piece of the solution that we are in charge of , and that is our own behavior ? My belief is that you do n't have to make yourself bad to look at these issues . I 'm not pointing the finger at America in a blaming way . I 'm simply saying , this is who we are right now . And if there are things that we see that we do n't like about our culture , then we have a choice . The degree of integrity that each of us can bring to the surface , to bring to this question , the depth of character that we can summon as we show up for the question of how do we change . It 's already defining us as individuals and as a nation , and it will continue to do that on into the future . And it will profoundly affect the well-being , the quality of life , of the billions of people who are going to inherit the results of our decisions . I 'm not speaking abstractly about this , I 'm speaking -- this is who we are in this room . Right now in this moment . Thank you and good afternoon . ( Applause ) </doc>

1480,A1,"Employers have to tread very carefully with regards to the extent of their professional involvement in an employees personal life . There can , however , be occasions when an employees personal situation could realistically impact on their work . These scenarios could include addiction issues , which could lead to a reduction in the level of their performance . They might also include becoming the victim of crime , which can obviously be very distressing and in certain cases could actually expose them and other employees to danger . For example , if the employee is the victim of domestic abuse , then it is possible that the aggressive party could visit them at their workplace . Employers will vary in the extent to which they are willing and / or able to offer assistance in these situations , however most employers should be able to put together a guide to where to get help to deal with challenging personal issues . This may help to stop minor problems becoming major ones , which could impact safety in the workplace . Encourage employees to see safety as something which matters to them It can be very easy for people to get into the habit of seeing the responsibility for safety as being someone elses problem . Whether its a security guard , patrolling a building or a mechanic making sure a cars brakes work properly , there are plenty of professions which literally make safety their business . Employers need to look at the potential safety issues which are most likely to affect their business . Then they need to liaise with professionals to create effective education for staff so that they feel empowered to cope with safety hazards and know when to take action and what action to take . Keep in-touch with staff This phrase has a whole variety of meanings and they all matter . It can be very easy for employers to become distanced from their staff . The greater the distance , the harder it becomes for employers to communicate with their employees , whether its giving information or receiving valuable feedback . The phrase has another important meaning too . Staff often benefit from being able to keep in touch with each other . Whether theyre popping out on an errand or going into a basement storeroom , even ground-level staff benefit hugely from some sort of communications device . Company mobiles may not be suitable for everyone , but two-way radios may be a viable alternative . Kit MacLean is now a full-time freelance writer and translator , but she has spent a fair bit of time working in environments where communication was a challenge . These have included caves , homeless shelters and a school for mentally-handicapped teenagers . When not writing , she enjoys playing poker and walking her dog . </doc>

1262,A9,"Article III of the United States Constitution extends federal judicial power to all cases arising under admiralty and maritime jurisdiction . The Death on the High Seas Act ( DOHSA ) in turn provides the exclusive , albeit monetarily limited , maritime remedy for wrongful deaths that take place on the "" high seas beyond 3 nautical miles from the shore of the United States . "" In Helman v. Alcoa Global Fasteners , Inc. , the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit considered , as a matter of first impression , whether DOHSA applied to , and thus preempted other available claims arising from , a fatal helicopter accident that occurred approximately nine and a half nautical miles off the California coastline . Finding little interpretive significance in the term "" high seas , "" the Ninth Circuit held that DOHSA becomes unconditionally operative seaward of three nautical miles from U.S. shores . . . </doc>

496,A8,"Dominic Fifield at Darius and Girenas Stadium Wednesday July 27 , 2005 The Guardian Liverpool supporters have seen it all now . Most are still pinching themselves after seeing their side lift the European Cup in May . Some , perhaps unjustly , are flinching at the £ 7m paid to Southampton for Peter Crouch . But all must have reeled in disbelief here last night at the sight of Jamie Carragher scoring a goal . The centre-half's reward , his first in six years and only the third goal of his career , helped establish a lead in this tie which should see Liverpool safely through to the third qualifying stage . It was timely , too . The holders trailed briefly and , on an awkward surface against spirited opponents , flirted with disaster before , eventually , their class told . Article continues A two-goal advantage going into next week's return should prove sufficient to ensure progress , with the draw for the final qualifying phase to be made on Friday . The possibility of facing Everton at that stage looms large , though for the moment Liverpool can take heart at a job half done . Rafael Benítez leaves the Baltic encouraged that , if he can prise a goal from Carragher , he is a miracle worker indeed . "" It 's been such a long time it 's a little bit embarrassing really but I 'm delighted to get that monkey off my back , "" admitted the 27-year-old , whose last goal had come in the 7-1 thrashing of Southampton in January 1999 . "" Hopefully I can add to that now . The manager said after the game he wants another three or four this season . That 's the target . I probably deserve the match ball after that . Me scoring one is like someone else getting a hat-trick . "" Liverpool needed him to break that long duck . Preparation , by Benítez's standards , had been sketchy for this tie and , confronted by the Lithuanians' eager early aggression , the holders briefly teetered . For six minutes embarrassment threatened after Arturas Rimkevicius gathered from a throw-in and flummoxed the ponderous Sami Hyypia near the touchline . The striker tore towards the area and pulled back to the top of the six-yard box where Giedrius Barevicius' mis-hit shot wrong-footed José Reina and dribbled in . The giddy reality of their lead took time to sink in with the locals and , had their striker Andrius Velicka been fit , they might have prospered further . Yet it always looked a temporary upset of the natural order . By the interval Liverpool were ahead . First Boudewijn Zenden's looping cross was nodded down by the debutant Crouch , a signing of real stature who provided no little elegance in his ground-play . Mindaugas Baguzis could have cleared but he dithered near the penalty spot and Djibril Cissé spun and thumped the equaliser into the corner . Kaunas's spirit momentarily drained and , while heads were down , Steven Gerrard's corner was headed in for Carragher's rare party piece . Cissé should have added a third before the interval , bursting on to Xabi Alonso's threaded pass and skimming a shot beyond Eduardas Kurskis only for Irmantas Zelmikas to scramble the ball from the line . The Frenchman missed again when clean through near the end but Liverpool's dominance had long since been established . There was real promise in the combination of Crouch and Cissé , the reassurance of Fernando Morientes emerging from the bench and Alonso's clever passing alongside Gerrard's purring menace in midfield . The hapless Baguzis tripped the galloping captain in the area nine minutes into the second period and Gerrard dispatched the penalty himself , his 15th European goal . "" We 're strong favourites and 90 % certain of going through after that but we 'll still need to find the other 10 % now , "" added Carragher . "" We 'll show them respect because we always do . "" Even so , a professional performance in what should prove a formality of the return next Tuesday and Liverpool , seeded and warming up nicely , will be one stage away from the Champions League proper . </doc>

24,A1,"The Return of Franco-German Leadership PARIS – Whoever wins September's parliamentary election in Germany , the time has come once again for a major Franco-German initiative . Regardless of their economic conditions or their confidence – or lack of it – in each other , France and Germany are more than ever jointly responsible for the future , if not the very survival , of the European project . Are there alternatives to Franco-German leadership of the European Union ? Joining Great Britain with them in a Club of Three would be a good idea , but it is out of the question nowadays . Britain has largely excluded itself from any leadership role in Europe . Gordon Brown is barely surviving as prime minister , and the Conservatives , whose return to power in the next year is almost certain , are as provincially euro-skeptic as ever , if not more so . Europe simply can not count on the British , at least for a while . The idea of a Club of Six , floated by Nicolas Sarkozy early in his presidency , was always abstract and is now untenable . Given Silvio Berlusconi's sexcapades , the Italy that he leads can not be taken seriously , while Spain is out of the running for an EU leadership role , owing to its dire economic conditions . As for Poland , although the bumbling Kaczynski "" twins "" have been removed from power , the country's fixation on security in its immediate neighborhood is incompatible with true European leadership . Since the other 21 EU members never liked the idea of a Club of Six to begin with , it is just as well that such a vision has been buried , probably forever . So where but France and Germany can Europe turn for leadership ? A positive referendum result on the Lisbon Treaty in Ireland in October would be a necessary but insufficient condition to jump-start an institutional re-launch of the EU . Above all , the EU needs political will and direction . Only Germany and France , acting together , can convey to Europe's citizens and to the world the sense that the EU is at long last waking up to today's global realities . Of course , it is impossible to underestimate the combination of suspicion , tension , and exasperation that characterizes Franco-German relations lately . To a large extent , Germany has become a "" second France "" in Europe , at a time when France is more French than ever . And they are not only putting their respective nationalisms first . They disagree on fundamentals – most of all , about how to surmount the economic crisis . But the two giants of Europe can agree to disagree about the virtues of German-style budgetary rigor or French-style fiscal stimulus as long as they do n't insult each other , and , more importantly , as long as they compensate for their philosophical differences with a well publicized program of joint initiatives on key subjects . As long as each remains convinced that no alternative to cooperation exists within the EU , and that European cooperation remains a priority for both , it should not be overly difficult to restore their leadership . After all , France and Germany are closer to each other on many key topics than they have been for a long time . With the return of France to NATO's integrated military structure , the two countries are on the same "" Atlantic "" wavelength for the first time since 1966 . Despite both sides' deep reservations about the mission in Afghanistan , they are clearly in the same boat , even if French troops , being closer to British troops in terms of combat , are more vulnerable than the Germans . And both countries would probably subscribe to the following formulation : "" Turkey's future is with Europe , but not necessarily in the European Union , at least in the foreseeable future . "" The fundamental question about how to deal with Russia remains a divisive issue , however . France and Germany have different sensitivities on the subject , which is both natural and inevitable , as these differences reflect both geography and history . Germany is not only much closer physically to Russia ; it is also much more dependent on Russia in terms of energy security . France must not delude itself : Germany is not about to convert to nuclear energy to reduce its reliance on Russian oil and gas . Yet Germany also must realize that Russia's negative evolution has consequences that Germans can not escape . A spectacular Franco-German security initiative following the election in Germany , accompanied by a joint message to the Kremlin , would also have the benefit of sending a message to the rest of the EU , particularly to its Václav Klauses : "" If you decide to paralyze the Union through stubborn ill will , you will only end up excluding yourselves , rather than dictating Europe's fate . "" France and Germany can not move Europe alone , but Europe without them can not move at all . </doc>

1582,A12,"Two more techniques for improving watering efficiency are grouping plants by container size and water requirement and using drip irrigation whenever possible . The Saunders Brothers distribute the ponds' water through a sophisticated , computerized irrigation system designed to show vertical inches of water applied over a particular area during a set time . The computer program has helped them know the exact amount of water scheduled for irrigation . As often happens with such conservation practices , Saunders Brothers , Inc. has realized significant operational cost savings from these investments . Last year , the family took a step further in irrigation efficiency . Tom takes up the tale : "" During the summer of 2011 , we invited two research professors from the University of Florida to help establish ET ( Evapotranspiration ) levels for all plants we grow . The work was the first of its kind in the United States and helped us establish definitive amounts of water needed by specific plants during the hottest times of the year . We plan to continue the work for two more years . Already we are seeing where we can cut irrigation levels , and we have found out that lower fertilizer levels due to the lower water requirement will actually grow an equally good plant at a savings . "" Between growing plants in plastic pots under plastic greenhouse covers and using plastic sheeting as the growing surface , the brothers found themselves accumulating a lot of that material . They are , however , innovative thinkers , so it 's no surprise that Saunders Brothers , Inc was the first container nursery in the United States to send its greenhouse film to Tyco Plastics in Monroe , Louisiana . "" In the early years , "" Tom says , "" our purchase of their plastic was dependent on them accepting our used plastic , which they then turned into garbage bags . We started this practice in 2002 . For years , we have palletized and shipped our plastic propagation trays to the Canadian Poly Recycling Association . We also recycle plastic containers that we are not planning on reusing . Finally , we recycle all cardboard that plants or other products arrive in . "" – John Page Williams </doc>

48,A4,"CHAPTER XXXIII When Mr. St. John went , it was beginning to snow ; the whirling storm continued all night . The next day a keen wind brought fresh and blinding falls ; by twilight the valley was drifted up and almost impassable . I had closed my shutter , laid a mat to the door to prevent the snow from blowing in under it , trimmed my fire , and after sitting nearly an hour on the hearth listening to the muffled fury of the tempest , I lit a candle , took down "" Marmion , "" and beginning -- "" Day set on Norham's castled steep , And Tweed's fair river broad and deep , And Cheviot's mountains lone ; The massive towers , the donjon keep , The flanking walls that round them sweep , In yellow lustre shone "" -- I soon forgot storm in music . I heard a noise : the wind , I thought , shook the door . No ; it was St. John Rivers , who , lifting the latch , came in out of the frozen hurricane--the howling darkness--and stood before me : the cloak that covered his tall figure all white as a glacier . I was almost in consternation , so little had I expected any guest from the blocked-up vale that night . "" Any ill news ? "" I demanded . "" Has anything happened ? "" "" No. How very easily alarmed you are ! "" he answered , removing his cloak and hanging it up against the door , towards which he again coolly pushed the mat which his entrance had deranged . He stamped the snow from his boots . "" I shall sully the purity of your floor , "" said he , "" but you must excuse me for once . "" Then he approached the fire . "" I have had hard work to get here , I assure you , "" he observed , as he warmed his hands over the flame . "" One drift took me up to the waist ; happily the snow is quite soft yet . "" "" But why are you come ? "" I could not forbear saying . "" Rather an inhospitable question to put to a visitor ; but since you ask it , I answer simply to have a little talk with you ; I got tired of my mute books and empty rooms . Besides , since yesterday I have experienced the excitement of a person to whom a tale has been half-told , and who is impatient to hear the sequel . "" He sat down . I recalled his singular conduct of yesterday , and really I began to fear his wits were touched . If he were insane , however , his was a very cool and collected insanity : I had never seen that handsome-featured face of his look more like chiselled marble than it did just now , as he put aside his snow-wet hair from his forehead and let the firelight shine free on his pale brow and cheek as pale , where it grieved me to discover the hollow trace of care or sorrow now so plainly graved . I waited , expecting he would say something I could at least comprehend ; but his hand was now at his chin , his finger on his lip : he was thinking . It struck me that his hand looked wasted like his face . A perhaps uncalled-for gush of pity came over my heart : I was moved to say -- "" I wish Diana or Mary would come and live with you : it is too bad that you should be quite alone ; and you are recklessly rash about your own health . "" "" Not at all , "" said he : "" I care for myself when necessary . I am well now . What do you see amiss in me ? "" This was said with a careless , abstracted indifference , which showed that my solicitude was , at least in his opinion , wholly superfluous . I was silenced . He still slowly moved his finger over his upper lip , and still his eye dwelt dreamily on the glowing grate ; thinking it urgent to say something , I asked him presently if he felt any cold draught from the door , which was behind him . "" No , no ! "" he responded shortly and somewhat testily . "" Well , "" I reflected , "" if you wo n ' t talk , you may be still ; I 'll let you alone now , and return to my book . "" So I snuffed the candle and resumed the perusal of "" Marmion . "" He soon stirred ; my eye was instantly drawn to his movements ; he only took out a morocco pocket-book , thence produced a letter , which he read in silence , folded it , put it back , relapsed into meditation . It was vain to try to read with such an inscrutable fixture before me ; nor could I , in impatience , consent to be dumb ; he might rebuff me if he liked , but talk I would . "" Have you heard from Diana and Mary lately ? "" "" Not since the letter I showed you a week ago . "" "" There has not been any change made about your own arrangements ? You will not be summoned to leave England sooner than you expected ? "" "" I fear not , indeed : such chance is too good to befall me . "" Baffled so far , I changed my ground . I bethought myself to talk about the school and my scholars . "" Mary Garrett's mother is better , and Mary came back to the school this morning , and I shall have four new girls next week from the Foundry Close--they would have come to-day but for the snow . "" "" Indeed ! "" "" Mr. Oliver pays for two . "" "" Does he ? "" "" He means to give the whole school a treat at Christmas . "" "" I know . "" "" Was it your suggestion ? "" "" No. "" "" Whose , then ? "" "" His daughter 's , I think . "" "" It is like her : she is so good-natured . "" "" Yes . "" Again came the blank of a pause : the clock struck eight strokes . It aroused him ; he uncrossed his legs , sat erect , turned to me . "" Leave your book a moment , and come a little nearer the fire , "" he said . Wondering , and of my wonder finding no end , I complied . "" Half-an-hour ago , "" he pursued , "" I spoke of my impatience to hear the sequel of a tale : on reflection , I find the matter will be better managed by my assuming the narrator's part , and converting you into a listener . Before commencing , it is but fair to warn you that the story will sound somewhat hackneyed in your ears ; but stale details often regain a degree of freshness when they pass through new lips . For the rest , whether trite or novel , it is short . "" Twenty years ago , a poor curate--never mind his name at this moment--fell in love with a rich man's daughter ; she fell in love with him , and married him , against the advice of all her friends , who consequently disowned her immediately after the wedding . Before two years passed , the rash pair were both dead , and laid quietly side by side under one slab . ( I have seen their grave ; it formed part of the pavement of a huge churchyard surrounding the grim , soot-black old cathedral of an overgrown manufacturing town in --- shire . ) They left a daughter , which , at its very birth , Charity received in her lap--cold as that of the snow-drift I almost stuck fast in to-night . Charity carried the friendless thing to the house of its rich maternal relations ; it was reared by an aunt-in - law , called ( I come to names now ) Mrs. Reed of Gateshead . You start--did you hear a noise ? I daresay it is only a rat scrambling along the rafters of the adjoining schoolroom : it was a barn before I had it repaired and altered , and barns are generally haunted by rats . -- To proceed . Mrs. Reed kept the orphan ten years : whether it was happy or not with her , I can not say , never having been told ; but at the end of that time she transferred it to a place you know--being no other than Lowood School , where you so long resided yourself . It seems her career there was very honourable : from a pupil , she became a teacher , like yourself--really it strikes me there are parallel points in her history and yours--she left it to be a governess : there , again , your fates were analogous ; she undertook the education of the ward of a certain Mr. Rochester . "" "" Mr. Rivers ! "" I interrupted . "" I can guess your feelings , "" he said , "" but restrain them for a while : I have nearly finished ; hear me to the end . Of Mr. Rochester's character I know nothing , but the one fact that he professed to offer honourable marriage to this young girl , and that at the very altar she discovered he had a wife yet alive , though a lunatic . What his subsequent conduct and proposals were is a matter of pure conjecture ; but when an event transpired which rendered inquiry after the governess necessary , it was discovered she was gone--no one could tell when , where , or how . She had left Thornfield Hall in the night ; every research after her course had been vain : the country had been scoured far and wide ; no vestige of information could be gathered respecting her . Yet that she should be found is become a matter of serious urgency : advertisements have been put in all the papers ; I myself have received a letter from one Mr. Briggs , a solicitor , communicating the details I have just imparted . Is it not an odd tale ? "" "" Just tell me this , "" said I , "" and since you know so much , you surely can tell it me--what of Mr. Rochester ? How and where is he ? What is he doing ? Is he well ? "" "" I am ignorant of all concerning Mr. Rochester : the letter never mentions him but to narrate the fraudulent and illegal attempt I have adverted to . You should rather ask the name of the governess--the nature of the event which requires her appearance . "" "" Did no one go to Thornfield Hall , then ? Did no one see Mr. Rochester ? "" "" I suppose not . "" "" But they wrote to him ? "" "" Of course . "" "" And what did he say ? Who has his letters ? "" "" Mr. Briggs intimates that the answer to his application was not from Mr. Rochester , but from a lady : it is signed ' Alice Fairfax . ' "" I felt cold and dismayed : my worst fears then were probably true : he had in all probability left England and rushed in reckless desperation to some former haunt on the Continent . And what opiate for his severe sufferings--what object for his strong passions--had he sought there ? I dared not answer the question . Oh , my poor master--once almost my husband--whom I had often called "" my dear Edward ! "" "" He must have been a bad man , "" observed Mr. Rivers . "" You do n't know him--do n't pronounce an opinion upon him , "" I said , with warmth . "" Very well , "" he answered quietly : "" and indeed my head is otherwise occupied than with him : I have my tale to finish . Since you wo n ' t ask the governess's name , I must tell it of my own accord . Stay ! I have it here--it is always more satisfactory to see important points written down , fairly committed to black and white . "" And the pocket-book was again deliberately produced , opened , sought through ; from one of its compartments was extracted a shabby slip of paper , hastily torn off : I recognised in its texture and its stains of ultra-marine , and lake , and vermillion , the ravished margin of the portrait-cover . He got up , held it close to my eyes : and I read , traced in Indian ink , in my own handwriting , the words "" JANE EYRE "" -- the work doubtless of some moment of abstraction . "" Briggs wrote to me of a Jane Eyre : "" he said , "" the advertisements demanded a Jane Eyre : I knew a Jane Elliott . -- I confess I had my suspicions , but it was only yesterday afternoon they were at once resolved into certainty . You own the name and renounce the _alias_ ? "" "" Yes--yes ; but where is Mr. Briggs ? He perhaps knows more of Mr. Rochester than you do . "" "" Briggs is in London . I should doubt his knowing anything at all about Mr. Rochester ; it is not in Mr. Rochester he is interested . Meantime , you forget essential points in pursuing trifles : you do not inquire why Mr. Briggs sought after you--what he wanted with you . "" "" Well , what did he want ? "" "" Merely to tell you that your uncle , Mr. Eyre of Madeira , is dead ; that he has left you all his property , and that you are now rich--merely that--nothing more . "" "" I ! -- rich ? "" "" Yes , you , rich--quite an heiress . "" Silence succeeded . "" You must prove your identity of course , "" resumed St. John presently : "" a step which will offer no difficulties ; you can then enter on immediate possession . Your fortune is vested in the English funds ; Briggs has the will and the necessary documents . "" Here was a new card turned up ! It is a fine thing , reader , to be lifted in a moment from indigence to wealth--a very fine thing ; but not a matter one can comprehend , or consequently enjoy , all at once . And then there are other chances in life far more thrilling and rapture-giving : _this_ is solid , an affair of the actual world , nothing ideal about it : all its associations are solid and sober , and its manifestations are the same . One does not jump , and spring , and shout hurrah ! at hearing one has got a fortune ; one begins to consider responsibilities , and to ponder business ; on a base of steady satisfaction rise certain grave cares , and we contain ourselves , and brood over our bliss with a solemn brow . Besides , the words Legacy , Bequest , go side by side with the words , Death , Funeral . My uncle I had heard was dead--my only relative ; ever since being made aware of his existence , I had cherished the hope of one day seeing him : now , I never should . And then this money came only to me : not to me and a rejoicing family , but to my isolated self . It was a grand boon doubtless ; and independence would be glorious--yes , I felt that--that thought swelled my heart . "" You unbend your forehead at last , "" said Mr. Rivers . "" I thought Medusa had looked at you , and that you were turning to stone . Perhaps now you will ask how much you are worth ? "" "" How much am I worth ? "" "" Oh , a trifle ! Nothing of course to speak of--twenty thousand pounds , I think they say--but what is that ? "" "" Twenty thousand pounds ? "" Here was a new stunner--I had been calculating on four or five thousand . This news actually took my breath for a moment : Mr. St. John , whom I had never heard laugh before , laughed now . "" Well , "" said he , "" if you had committed a murder , and I had told you your crime was discovered , you could scarcely look more aghast . "" "" It is a large sum--do n't you think there is a mistake ? "" "" No mistake at all . "" "" Perhaps you have read the figures wrong--it may be two thousand ! "" "" It is written in letters , not figures , -- twenty thousand . "" I again felt rather like an individual of but average gastronomical powers sitting down to feast alone at a table spread with provisions for a hundred . Mr. Rivers rose now and put his cloak on . "" If it were not such a very wild night , "" he said , "" I would send Hannah down to keep you company : you look too desperately miserable to be left alone . But Hannah , poor woman ! could not stride the drifts so well as I : her legs are not quite so long : so I must e ' en leave you to your sorrows . Good-night . "" He was lifting the latch : a sudden thought occurred to me . "" Stop one minute ! "" I cried . "" Well ? "" "" It puzzles me to know why Mr. Briggs wrote to you about me ; or how he knew you , or could fancy that you , living in such an out-of-the-way place , had the power to aid in my discovery . "" "" Oh ! I am a clergyman , "" he said ; "" and the clergy are often appealed to about odd matters . "" Again the latch rattled . "" No ; that does not satisfy me ! "" I exclaimed : and indeed there was something in the hasty and unexplanatory reply which , instead of allaying , piqued my curiosity more than ever . "" It is a very strange piece of business , "" I added ; "" I must know more about it . "" "" Another time . "" "" No ; to-night ! -- to-night ! "" and as he turned from the door , I placed myself between it and him . He looked rather embarrassed . "" You certainly shall not go till you have told me all , "" I said . "" I would rather not just now . "" "" You shall ! -- you must ! "" "" I would rather Diana or Mary informed you . "" Of course these objections wrought my eagerness to a climax : gratified it must be , and that without delay ; and I told him so . "" But I apprised you that I was a hard man , "" said he , "" difficult to persuade . "" "" And I am a hard woman , -- impossible to put off . "" "" And then , "" he pursued , "" I am cold : no fervour infects me . "" "" Whereas I am hot , and fire dissolves ice . The blaze there has thawed all the snow from your cloak ; by the same token , it has streamed on to my floor , and made it like a trampled street . As you hope ever to be forgiven , Mr. Rivers , the high crime and misdemeanour of spoiling a sanded kitchen , tell me what I wish to know . "" "" Well , then , "" he said , "" I yield ; if not to your earnestness , to your perseverance : as stone is worn by continual dropping . Besides , you must know some day , -- as well now as later . Your name is Jane Eyre ? "" "" Of course : that was all settled before . "" "" You are not , perhaps , aware that I am your namesake ? -- that I was christened St. John Eyre Rivers ? "" "" No , indeed ! I remember now seeing the letter E. comprised in your initials written in books you have at different times lent me ; but I never asked for what name it stood . But what then ? Surely -- "" I stopped : I could not trust myself to entertain , much less to express , the thought that rushed upon me--that embodied itself , -- that , in a second , stood out a strong , solid probability . Circumstances knit themselves , fitted themselves , shot into order : the chain that had been lying hitherto a formless lump of links was drawn out straight , -- every ring was perfect , the connection complete . I knew , by instinct , how the matter stood , before St. John had said another word ; but I can not expect the reader to have the same intuitive perception , so I must repeat his explanation . "" My mother's name was Eyre ; she had two brothers ; one a clergyman , who married Miss Jane Reed , of Gateshead ; the other , John Eyre , Esq. , merchant , late of Funchal , Madeira . Mr. Briggs , being Mr. Eyre's solicitor , wrote to us last August to inform us of our uncle's death , and to say that he had left his property to his brother the clergyman's orphan daughter , overlooking us , in consequence of a quarrel , never forgiven , between him and my father . He wrote again a few weeks since , to intimate that the heiress was lost , and asking if we knew anything of her . A name casually written on a slip of paper has enabled me to find her out . You know the rest . "" Again he was going , but I set my back against the door . "" Do let me speak , "" I said ; "" let me have one moment to draw breath and reflect . "" I paused--he stood before me , hat in hand , looking composed enough . I resumed -- "" Your mother was my father's sister ? "" "" Yes . "" "" My aunt , consequently ? "" He bowed . "" My uncle John was your uncle John ? You , Diana , and Mary are his sister's children , as I am his brother's child ? "" "" Undeniably . "" "" You three , then , are my cousins ; half our blood on each side flows from the same source ? "" "" We are cousins ; yes . "" I surveyed him . It seemed I had found a brother : one I could be proud of , -- one I could love ; and two sisters , whose qualities were such , that , when I knew them but as mere strangers , they had inspired me with genuine affection and admiration . The two girls , on whom , kneeling down on the wet ground , and looking through the low , latticed window of Moor House kitchen , I had gazed with so bitter a mixture of interest and despair , were my near kinswomen ; and the young and stately gentleman who had found me almost dying at his threshold was my blood relation . Glorious discovery to a lonely wretch ! This was wealth indeed ! -- wealth to the heart ! -- a mine of pure , genial affections . This was a blessing , bright , vivid , and exhilarating ; -- not like the ponderous gift of gold : rich and welcome enough in its way , but sobering from its weight . I now clapped my hands in sudden joy--my pulse bounded , my veins thrilled . "" Oh , I am glad ! -- I am glad ! "" I exclaimed . St. John smiled . "" Did I not say you neglected essential points to pursue trifles ? "" he asked . "" You were serious when I told you you had got a fortune ; and now , for a matter of no moment , you are excited . "" "" What can you mean ? It may be of no moment to you ; you have sisters and do n't care for a cousin ; but I had nobody ; and now three relations , -- or two , if you do n't choose to be counted , -- are born into my world full-grown . I say again , I am glad ! "" I walked fast through the room : I stopped , half suffocated with the thoughts that rose faster than I could receive , comprehend , settle them : -- thoughts of what might , could , would , and should be , and that ere long . I looked at the blank wall : it seemed a sky thick with ascending stars , -- every one lit me to a purpose or delight . Those who had saved my life , whom , till this hour , I had loved barrenly , I could now benefit . They were under a yoke , -- I could free them : they were scattered , -- I could reunite them : the independence , the affluence which was mine , might be theirs too . Were we not four ? Twenty thousand pounds shared equally would be five thousand each , justice--enough and to spare : justice would be done , -- mutual happiness secured . Now the wealth did not weigh on me : now it was not a mere bequest of coin , -- it was a legacy of life , hope , enjoyment . How I looked while these ideas were taking my spirit by storm , I can not tell ; but I perceived soon that Mr. Rivers had placed a chair behind me , and was gently attempting to make me sit down on it . He also advised me to be composed ; I scorned the insinuation of helplessness and distraction , shook off his hand , and began to walk about again . "" Write to Diana and Mary to-morrow , "" I said , "" and tell them to come home directly . Diana said they would both consider themselves rich with a thousand pounds , so with five thousand they will do very well . "" "" Tell me where I can get you a glass of water , "" said St. John ; "" you must really make an effort to tranquillise your feelings . "" "" Nonsense ! and what sort of an effect will the bequest have on you ? Will it keep you in England , induce you to marry Miss Oliver , and settle down like an ordinary mortal ? "" "" You wander : your head becomes confused . I have been too abrupt in communicating the news ; it has excited you beyond your strength . "" "" Mr. Rivers ! you quite put me out of patience : I am rational enough ; it is you who misunderstand , or rather who affect to misunderstand . "" "" Perhaps , if you explained yourself a little more fully , I should comprehend better . "" "" Explain ! What is there to explain ? You can not fail to see that twenty thousand pounds , the sum in question , divided equally between the nephew and three nieces of our uncle , will give five thousand to each ? What I want is , that you should write to your sisters and tell them of the fortune that has accrued to them . "" "" To you , you mean . "" "" I have intimated my view of the case : I am incapable of taking any other . I am not brutally selfish , blindly unjust , or fiendishly ungrateful . Besides , I am resolved I will have a home and connections . I like Moor House , and I will live at Moor House ; I like Diana and Mary , and I will attach myself for life to Diana and Mary . It would please and benefit me to have five thousand pounds ; it would torment and oppress me to have twenty thousand ; which , moreover , could never be mine in justice , though it might in law . I abandon to you , then , what is absolutely superfluous to me . Let there be no opposition , and no discussion about it ; let us agree amongst each other , and decide the point at once . "" "" This is acting on first impulses ; you must take days to consider such a matter , ere your word can be regarded as valid . "" "" Oh ! if all you doubt is my sincerity , I am easy : you see the justice of the case ? "" "" I _do_ see a certain justice ; but it is contrary to all custom . Besides , the entire fortune is your right : my uncle gained it by his own efforts ; he was free to leave it to whom he would : he left it to you . After all , justice permits you to keep it : you may , with a clear conscience , consider it absolutely your own . "" "" With me , "" said I , "" it is fully as much a matter of feeling as of conscience : I must indulge my feelings ; I so seldom have had an opportunity of doing so . Were you to argue , object , and annoy me for a year , I could not forego the delicious pleasure of which I have caught a glimpse--that of repaying , in part , a mighty obligation , and winning to myself lifelong friends . "" "" You think so now , "" rejoined St. John , "" because you do not know what it is to possess , nor consequently to enjoy wealth : you can not form a notion of the importance twenty thousand pounds would give you ; of the place it would enable you to take in society ; of the prospects it would open to you : you can not -- "" "" And you , "" I interrupted , "" can not at all imagine the craving I have for fraternal and sisterly love . I never had a home , I never had brothers or sisters ; I must and will have them now : you are not reluctant to admit me and own me , are you ? "" "" Jane , I will be your brother--my sisters will be your sisters--without stipulating for this sacrifice of your just rights . "" "" Brother ? Yes ; at the distance of a thousand leagues ! Sisters ? Yes ; slaving amongst strangers ! I , wealthy--gorged with gold I never earned and do not merit ! You , penniless ! Famous equality and fraternisation ! Close union ! Intimate attachment ! "" "" But , Jane , your aspirations after family ties and domestic happiness may be realised otherwise than by the means you contemplate : you may marry . "" "" Nonsense , again ! Marry ! I do n't want to marry , and never shall marry . "" "" That is saying too much : such hazardous affirmations are a proof of the excitement under which you labour . "" "" It is not saying too much : I know what I feel , and how averse are my inclinations to the bare thought of marriage . No one would take me for love ; and I will not be regarded in the light of a mere money speculation . And I do not want a stranger--unsympathising , alien , different from me ; I want my kindred : those with whom I have full fellow - feeling . Say again you will be my brother : when you uttered the words I was satisfied , happy ; repeat them , if you can , repeat them sincerely . "" "" I think I can . I know I have always loved my own sisters ; and I know on what my affection for them is grounded , -- respect for their worth and admiration of their talents . You too have principle and mind : your tastes and habits resemble Diana's and Mary's ; your presence is always agreeable to me ; in your conversation I have already for some time found a salutary solace . I feel I can easily and naturally make room in my heart for you , as my third and youngest sister . "" "" Thank you : that contents me for to-night . Now you had better go ; for if you stay longer , you will perhaps irritate me afresh by some mistrustful scruple . "" "" And the school , Miss Eyre ? It must now be shut up , I suppose ? "" "" No. I will retain my post of mistress till you get a substitute . "" He smiled approbation : we shook hands , and he took leave . I need not narrate in detail the further struggles I had , and arguments I used , to get matters regarding the legacy settled as I wished . My task was a very hard one ; but , as I was absolutely resolved--as my cousins saw at length that my mind was really and immutably fixed on making a just division of the property--as they must in their own hearts have felt the equity of the intention ; and must , besides , have been innately conscious that in my place they would have done precisely what I wished to do--they yielded at length so far as to consent to put the affair to arbitration . The judges chosen were Mr. Oliver and an able lawyer : both coincided in my opinion : I carried my point . The instruments of transfer were drawn out : St. John , Diana , Mary , and I , each became possessed of a competency . </doc>

1648,A16,"Greek withdrawal from the eurozone "" Grexit "" redirects here . For the software formerly known as GrexIt , see Hiver ( software ) . The Greek withdrawal from the eurozone is the potential exit of Greece from the eurozone , primarily for the country to deal with its government-debt crisis . This conjecture is often referred to as "" Grexit "" , a portmanteau combining the English words "" Greek "" and "" exit "" . The term "" Graccident "" ( accidental Grexit ) was coined for the case that Greece exited the EU and the euro without intention . These terms first came into use in 2012 and have been revitalised at each of the bailouts made available to Greece since then . Proponents of the proposal argue that leaving the euro and reintroducing the drachma would dramatically boost exports and tourism and while discouraging expensive imports and thereby give the Greek economy the possibility to recover and stand on its own feet . Opponents argue that the proposal would impose excessive hardship on the Greek people , as the short-term effects would be a significant consumption and wealth reduction for the Greek population . This may cause civil unrest in Greece and harm the reputation of the eurozone . Additionally , it could cause Greece to align more with non-EU states . The term ' Grexit ' was coined by the Citigroup economist Ebrahim Rahbari and was introduced by Rahbari and Citigroup's Global Chief Economist Willem H. Buiter on 6 February 2012 . After the announcement of the bailout referendum on 27 June 2015 speculation rose . That day BBC News reported that "" default appears inevitable "" , though it later removed the online statement . On 29 June 2015 it was announced that Greek banks would remain closed all week , cash withdrawals from banks would be limited to € 60 per day , and international money transfers would be limited to urgent pre-approved commercial transfers . The International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) admitted that its forecast about Greek economy was too optimistic : in 2010 it described Greece's first bailout programme as a holding operation that gave the eurozone time to build a firewall to protect other vulnerable members , but in 2012 the unemployment rate of Greece became about 25 percent , compared to IMF's projection of about 15 percent . IMF conceded that it underestimated the damage that austerity programmes would do to the Greek economy , adding that , in terms of Greece's debt , IMF should have considered a debt restructuring earlier . As can be seen from the Figure A , IMF's forecast in the 2010 standby agreement said that the Southern European country would start to grow in real terms after 2011 . But in fact the economy continued to shrink , and Greek real GDP in 2013 was about 76 percent of that in 2008 . In mid-May 2012 , the financial crisis in Greece and the impossibility of forming a new government after elections led to strong speculation that Greece would leave the eurozone shortly . This phenomenon had already become known as "" Grexit "" . Economists who favour this approach to solve the Greek debt crisis argue that a default is unavoidable for Greece in the long term , and that a delay in organising an orderly default ( by lending Greece more money throughout a few more years ) would just wind up hurting EU lenders and neighbouring European countries even more . Fiscal austerity or a euro exit is the alternative to accepting differentiated government bond yields within the Euro Area . If Greece remains in the euro while accepting higher bond yields , reflecting its high government deficit , then high interest rates would dampen demand , raise savings and slow the economy . An improved trade performance and less reliance on foreign capital would be the result . The implementation of Grexit would have to occur "" within days or even hours of the decision being made "" due to the high volatility that would result . It would have to be timed at one of the public holidays in Greece . One US economist has argued that the legal grounds upon which the "" troika , "" composed by the EU Commission , the European Central Bank and the IMF , has pursued the harsh macroeconomic adjustment plans imposed on Greece are shaky , claiming they infringe upon Greece's sovereignty and interfere in the internal affairs of an independent EU nation-state : "" the overt infringements on Greek sovereignty we 're witnessing today , with EU policy makers now double-checking all national data and carefully ' monitoring ' the work of the Greek government sets a dangerous precedent . "" He argues that a withdrawal from the Eurozone would give the Greek government more room for maneuver to conduct public policies propitious for long-term growth and social equity . "" Plan Z "" is the name given to a 2012 plan to enable Greece to withdraw from the eurozone in the event of Greek bank collapse . It was drawn up in absolute secrecy by small teams totalling approximately two dozen officials at the EU Commission ( Brussels ) , the European Central Bank ( Frankfurt ) and the IMF ( Washington ) . Those officials were headed by Jörg Asmussen ( ECB ) , Thomas Wieser ( Euro working group ) , Poul Thomsen ( IMF ) and Marco Buti ( European Commission ) . To prevent premature disclosure no single document was created , no emails were exchanged , and no Greek officials were informed . The plan was based on the 2003 introduction of new dinars into Iraq by the Americans and would have required rebuilding the Greek economy and banking system ab initio , including isolating Greek banks by disconnecting them from the TARGET2 system , closing ATMs , and imposing capital and currency controls . The prospect of Greece leaving the euro and dealing with a devalued drachma prompted many people to start withdrawing their euros from the country's banks . In the nine months to March 2012 deposits in Greek banks had already fallen 13 % to € 160,000,000,000 . A victory for anti-bailout lawmakers in the 17 June 2012 election would likely trigger an even bigger bank run , said Dimitris Mardas , associate professor of economics at the University of Thessaloniiki . Greek authorities , Mardas predicted , would respond by imposing controls on the movement of money for as long as it takes for the panic to subside . Against this plan , a political initiative , the so-called Menoume Europi was founded in 2012 by students in Oxford University , and it spread among Greek students in other European universities . The first demonstration took place in Athens , Syntagma Square in June 2012 in between two major elections that brought to the country political instability and financial insecurity . A Grexit , assuming that it coincided with adoption of a new currency , would require preparation , for example with capacity for banknote stamping or printing a stock of new banknotes . However , information leaking out on such preparations might lead to negative dynamic effects , like bank runs . Conversely , leaving the Eurozone , but retaining the Euro as de facto currency , would avoid the practical issues and relieve the country of the burden of its Eurozone responsibilities . In the event of a new currency being introduced , all banks would close for several days to allow old ( Euro ) banknotes to be stamped to denote that they were now drachmas , and / or a newly printed currency to be distributed to bank branches for distribution to the public when banks reopened . The British money printing company De La Rue was , according to rumours on 18 May 2012 , preparing to print new drachma notes based on old moulds , which De La Rue refused to confirm . The typical time between an order for a new currency being placed and the delivery of the banknotes is about six months . In July 2012 , the Wolfson Economics Prize , a prize for the "" best proposal for a country to leave the European Monetary Union "" , was awarded to a Capital Economics team led by Roger Bootle , for their submission titled "" Leaving the Euro : A Practical Guide . "" The winning proposal argued that a member wishing to exit should introduce a new currency and default on a large part of its debts . The net effect , the proposal claimed , would be positive for growth and prosperity . It also called for keeping the euro for small transactions and for a short period of time after the exit from the eurozone , along with a strict regime of inflation-targeting and tough fiscal rules monitored by "" independent experts "" . The Roger Bootle / Capital Economics plan also suggested that "" key officials "" should meet "" in secret "" one month before the exit is publicly announced , and that eurozone partners and international organisations should be informed "" three days before "" . The judges of the Wolfson Economics Prize found that the winning plan was the "" most credible solution "" to the question of a member state leaving the eurozone . On 29 May 2012 the National Bank of Greece ( not to be confused with the central bank , the Bank of Greece ) warned that "" n exit from the euro would lead to a significant decline in the living standards of Greek citizens . "" According to the announcement , per capita income would fall by 55 % , the new national currency would depreciate by 65 % vis-à-vis the euro , and the recession would deepen to 22 % . Furthermore , unemployment would rise from its current 22 % to 34 % of the work force , and inflation , which was then at 2 % , would soar to 30 % . According to the Greek think-tank Foundation for Economic and Industrial Research ( IOBE ) , a new drachma would lose half or more of its value relative to the euro . This would drive up inflation , and reduce the purchasing power of the average Greek . At the same time , the country's economic output would drop , putting more people out of work where one in five is already unemployed . The prices of imported goods would skyrocket , putting them out of reach for many . Analyst Vangelis Agapitos estimated that inflation under the new drachma would quickly reach 40 to 50 per cent to catch up with the fall in the new currency's value . To stop the falling value of the drachma , interest rates would have to be increased to as high as 30 to 40 per cent , according to Agapitos . People would then be unable to pay off their loans and mortgages and the country's banks would have to be nationalised to stop them from going under , he predicted . IOBE head of research Aggelos Tsakanikas foresaw an increase in crime as a consequence of a Grexit , as people struggled to pay bills . "" We wo n't see tanks in the streets and violence , we wo n't see people starving in the streets , but crime could very well rise "" . The centre-right New Democracy party has accused the leftist SYRIZA of supporting withdrawal from the euro . However , SYRIZA's leader , Alexis Tsipras , has stated that Greece should not leave the eurozone and return to the drachma because "" ... we will have poor people , who have drachmas , and rich people , who will buy everything with euros . "" Public opinion also mostly favours keeping the euro . Of all the political parties which won seats in the parliamentary election in May 2012 , only the Communist KKE expressed support for leaving the euro , and indeed for leaving the European Union . However , its General Secretary , Dimitris Koutsoumpas , pondered : "" The exit from the EU and the euro will be hazardous , a blind alley unless it is combined with a concrete plan , a programme for the economy and society , with a new organization of society , i.e. a socialist society with the socialization of the concentrated means of production , unilateral cancelation of the debt , working class and people's power . "" On 21 August 2015 , 25 MPs from SYRIZA split from the party and formed Popular Unity , which fully supports leaving the euro . In the September 2015 Greek legislative election , the party won only 2.8 % of the popular vote , winning no seats . Both the Greek government and the EU favour Greece staying within the Euro and believe this to be possible . However , some commentators believe an exit is likely . In February 2015 , the former head of the US Federal Reserve , Alan Greenspan , said "" it is just a matter of time "" for Greece to withdraw from the eurozone , and former United Kingdom Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke described it as inevitable . A leaked document reveals that , during informal discussion with one of the European leaders , UK Prime Minister David Cameron suggested that Greece might be better off if it leaves the eurozone . British officials declined to make their comments on the leaked document . Richard Koo , chief economist for Nomura Research Institute , accused IMF and EU of basing their negotiation position on unrealistic assumptions . As Koo pointed out , IMF's argument was that if the austerity programme had been implemented as assumed , no further debt relief would have been needed under 2012 's framework . The EU's argument was that Greece encountered a difficult situation in 2015 because it delayed implementation of structural reforms . Koo said that the argument was highly unrealistic because structural reforms do not work in a short run , adding that the US did not benefit from the Reaganomics structural reforms during Reagan's era . After publishing documents which admit that the southern European country needs debt relief and a moratorium on debt repayment for 30 years , the IMF was only "" slowly beginning to understand "" the Greek economy , said Koo . In January 2015 , speculation about a Greek exit from the eurozone was revived when Michael Fuchs , who is deputy leader of the center-right CDU / CSU faction in the German Bundestag , was quoted on 31 December 2014 : "" The time when we had to rescue Greece is over . There is no more blackmail potential . Greece is not systemically relevant for the euro . "" A following article in the weekly Spiegel citing sources from Wolfgang Schäuble ' s ministry of finance further spurred these speculations . Both German and international media widely interpreted this as the Merkel government tacitly warning Greek voters from voting for SYRIZA in the upcoming legislative election of 25 January 2015 . Germany's largest selling tabloid , the right-wing populist Bild , raised further anger when it compared Greece to an unfair footballer : "" What happens to a footballer who breaks the rules and does a crude foul ? – He leaves the pitch . He is sent off as a punishment . No question . "" The German government's interference in the January 2015 elections in Greece was strongly criticized by leaders of European Parliament groups including Socialists & Democrats ( S & D ) , the liberal ALDE and the Greens / EFA group , when S & D president Gianni Pittella said , "" German right-wing forces trying to act like a sheriff in Greece or any other member states is not only unacceptable but above all wrong . "" It has also been criticized by the German opposition party The Greens ' , with its speaker Simone Peter calling the debate over a Grexit "" highly irresponsible "" . Economists of German Commerzbank said that preventing a Greek exit was still desirable for Germany , since a Greek exit would wipe out billions of euros in European taxpayer money , and "" it would be much easier politically to renegotiate a compromise with Greece , albeit a lame one , and thus maintain the fiction that Greece will pay back its loans at some point in time . "" FTSE "" considers Grexit following the election to be highly unlikely ... "" . On 9 February , UK Prime Minister David Cameron chaired a meeting to discuss any possible ramifications in the event of an exit . According to a Bloomberg report George Osborne said at the meeting of the G-20 finance ministers in Istanbul : "" A Greek exit from the euro would be very difficult for the world economy and potentially very damaging for the European economy . "" In February 2015 , the Russian government stated that it would offer Greece aid but would only provide it in rubles . Kathimerini reported that after 16 February Eurogroup talks Commerzbank AG increased the risk of Greece exiting the euro to 50 % . The expression used by Time for these talks is "" Greece and the Euro Zone dance on the precipice "" . After an emergency meeting of eurozone finance ministers ( 20 February 2015 ) , European leaders agreed to extend Greece's bailout for further four months . By late June 2015 negotiations on a deal had collapsed , and Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras called a referendum for 5 July on the revised proposals from the IMF and the EU , which he said that his government would campaign against . The referendum was defeated by a margin of 61 % to 39 % . Eurozone finance ministers have refused to extend the bailout . Questioned on whether the referendum would be a euro-drachma dilemma , Greece's finance minister , Yanis Varoufakis , said that European Treaties make provisions for an exit from the EU but do not make any provisions for an exit from the Eurozone . A referendum as a choice involving exit from the Eurozone would violate EU Treaties and EU Law . A political cartoon of the "" domino effect "" view of a Grexit . Claudia Panseri , head of equity strategy at Société Générale , speculated in late May 2012 that eurozone stocks could plummet up to 50 percent in value if Greece makes a disorderly exit from the eurozone . Bond yields in other European nations could widen 1 percent point to 2 percent points , negatively affecting their ability to service their own sovereign debts . Europe in 2010 accounted for 25 percent of world trade , according to Deutsche Bank . Economic depression within the European economy would ripple worldwide and slow global growth . However , Greece represents just a small fraction – less than 2 per cent – of European gross domestic product ( GDP ) . ... that negotiated withdrawal from the EU would not be legally impossible even prior to the ratification of the Lisbon Treaty , and that unilateral withdrawal would undoubtedly be legally controversial ; that , while permissible , a recently enacted exit clause is , prima facie , not in harmony with the rationale of the European unification project and is otherwise problematic , mainly from a legal perspective ; that a Member State's exit from EMU , without a parallel withdrawal from the EU , would be legally inconceivable ; and that , while perhaps feasible through indirect means , a Member State's expulsion from the EU or EMU , would be legally next to impossible . In the legal literature , the question of whether a country can unilaterally leave the Eurozone without leaving the EU is controversial . Jens Dammann has taken the view that under certain conditions , it is possible for a Member State to end its membership in the Eurozone without leaving the European Union . </doc>

1143,A17,"SAS : Rogue Heroes by Ben Macintyre is a superb study of wartime daring – review 5 An early SAS soldier trying to control a parachute in the Libyan desert in the Second World War Credit : SAS Regimental Association Archive Sinclair McKay is thrilled by a study of the SAS's intrepid early days and the terrifying men picked for its first regiment ' No bragging or swanking , "" was the rule set down by David Stirling , the languidly spoken founder of the Special Air Service . This was partly down to sensible military secrecy about hazardous covert missions ; partly because Stirling thought boasting in itself distasteful . I n theory , his shade would shudder at the very idea of this book . With unprecedented access to SAS regimental archives and diaries , Ben Macintyre has charted the wartime genesis of an outfit that has since acquired , via barnstorming courage and picaresque detail ( from the motto , "" Who Dares Wins "" , to the insignia – not , as most think , a flaming dagger , but the fiery sword Excalibur ) the sort of legendary status usually reserved for Agent 007 . David Stirling and Jock Lewes prepare a desert raid Credit : SAS Regimental Association Archive I t was in 1941 , in north Africa , when the British were under pressure from Rommel's forces , that Stirling , a gangling , posh 26-year-old Scot and Left-Bank artist turned commando , conceived the idea with John "" Jock "" Lewes , a mainstay of society magazines , for a regiment of specially trained marauders . Instead of commandos attacking en masse , Stirling thought : why not have a nimbler outfit that could split into tiny units , carry out daring sabotage raids – then melt into the desert sands ? Macintyre's compelling tale is full of jeopardy : bone-shattering parachute drops , terrifying night-time raids on Nazi airfields , fizzing explosive fuses , near escapes in screaming jeeps , harrowing marches through deserts , frozen forest encounters with desperate Germans and mad , edgy drinking bouts that could end with grenades being flourished . As in his previous work on espionage and intrigue , such as Agent Zigzag ( 2007 ) or Operation Mincemeat ( 2010 ) , Macintyre has no problem delivering a colourful narrative rich in moral ambiguities . Preparing for action in the desert camp at Bir el Quseir , Summer 1942 : Graham Rose and Jimmy Storie , two of the early recruits to L Detachment Credit : SAS Regimental Association Archive S AS : Rogue Heroes is a curious , unsettling mix of T E Lawrence-style romanticism – impulsive individualism in the desert sands – and outbreaks of grand guignol : tunics smeared with "" blood and pulp "" ; bodies reduced to separate lumps of "" smoking human flesh "" . Even in the storm of war , some SAS violence was sociopathic – these were men who , occasionally , could not be stopped . Stirling's first group of "" rogue warriors "" was drawn from all sorts of backgrounds and Macintyre familiarises us with their ( often surprising ) hinterlands while never letting us feel quite at ease with some of them . There was grammar school boy Johnny Cooper , who , despite looking like Private Pike from Dad's Army , was preternaturally tough . There was amateur boxing champion Reg Seekings , "" hard , in the way that very few people are truly hard ... [ with ] no compunction about the shedding of blood "" . But he had vulnerability , too : dyslexia made his report-writing a battle . Everyone else "" would be asleep and I 'd still be struggling with my notes "" , he recalled . While two SAS men take cover under fire in France , Paddy Mayne , right , appears to be reading Credit : SAS Regimental Association Archive T here was also – for a time , before he was invalided out – Winston Churchill's son , Randolph . And there was the formidable Robert Blair "" Paddy "" Mayne , a rugby player , frustrated poet , militant Ulster unionist , devotee of A E Housman and demonic drinker . Alcohol inspired in Mayne volcanic bouts of brutality ( perhaps a by-product of furiously repressed homosexuality ) , then amnesia . After a brutal training regime , Stirling's fledgling SAS regiment launched a night-time raid in December 1941 on Tamet airfield in Libya , intending to blow up parked planes . As they crept toward their targets , Mayne was distracted by light coming from under the door of a hut . A large group of Germans and Italians were having , as he put it , "" some sort of party "" . He kicked open the door , said "" Good evening "" – then opened fire with a Tommy gun . He could n't stop himself . No Axis soldier left that hut alive . Stirling was shocked , but a British newspaper later exulted in Mayne's display of ruthless insouciance . Bloodthirsty press coverage versus chilly operational reality has been a recurring feature of the SAS since , notes Macintyre . Before a desert raid , Stirling stands at right Credit : SAS Regimental Association Archive B ut the SAS pioneers were making up a new kind of war on the hoof , and its missions often flopped horribly : inexperience with parachutes , getaway cars that broke down , inflatable boats with punctures . Men were stranded in the vast "" sea of sand "" of southern Libya , with nothing but urine to drink . After several days of this torture , one party of SAS men came across Italian soldiers , ambushed them , then filled up on tins of "" fishy spaghetti "" and water from their car radiators . After the British had pummelled Rommel in north Africa , the ever-growing SAS , which by 1943 had some 300 recruits , was deployed in forward missions in Sicily and Italy , knocking out defensive positions to clear the way for the advancing Allied forces . Even though the wider army was reconciled ( after initial resistance ) to this autonomous crew , there was still vagueness about how best to deploy them in Europe . The SAS men thus found themselves shoulder to shoulder in the undergrowth with the French resistance ; they were among the first to arrive at Bergen-Belsen . Liberation : SAS soldier festooned with bouquets by French villagers as they pressed east Credit : SAS Regimental Association Archive I n a compassionate afterword , Macintyre outlines the post-war careers of these pioneers : some went to Africa for private "" security "" work ; others ran pubs and hotels ; one ended up on the streets . You are left to wonder how they felt . Having waged war of such intensity , what sort of life could possibly follow ? </doc>

1638,A16,"Anselm Bourke Mgr Anselm Bourke , born Nicholas Bourke , ( Dublin , 10 September 1835 – West Perth , 2 June 1924 ) was a Roman Catholic priest of Irish origins . He was prominent in Catholic education for several decades , and also founded the West Perth ( now Northbridge ) parish of the Church in 1901 . He made his profession as a Benedictine monk in 1858 , but got dispensation from his monastic vows from the Vatican in 1871 ; therefore , he can not be called a Benedictine . He was still studying to become a priest of the Benedictine order when he arrived in Western Australia on 24 May 1855 aboard the Lady Amhurst with the Spanish Benedictine Father José María Benito Serra OSB - also known as Joseph Serra in Western Australia - , and several other clergymen , mostly Spaniards , but also Irish and French . He made his religious profession on 26 July 1858 , and completed his education and was ordained in 1859 . In 1860 , Bourke was appointed to teach at the Roman Catholic boys' schools at Fremantle and Perth , where he became known as an able scholar and teacher . In 1864 , he was appointed the first parish priest of York – prior to this , the parish had been administered by priests from Toodyay and New Norcia . He lived in simple quarters at the rear of the church and conducted Mass every Sunday . During his time in York , he employed ten ticket of leave men , including three as teachers . Returning to Perth in 1870 , he became the chaplain of Fremantle Prison , and taught at various schools . He got dispensation from his monastic vows on 30 April 4 , 1871 , but his name would still be the one he used in his profession , for which he was known in the Colony , not his birth one . The troublesome years of Bourke , his erratic behaviour and apparent mental problems , his difficult disengagement from the Benedictines and from New Norcia , as well as his temporary exile from Western Australia , ignored by most scholars until now , are mentioned by Dr. Teresa De Castro . In 1885 , he became the first resident priest of the Vasse region at Busselton . In 1889 , on returning to Perth , he became Vicar General for Western Australia serving under Bishop Matthew Gibney , and served voluntarily as New Norcia's agent in Perth , and canvassed the Government for a Roman Catholic representative on the Education Board . He also became active in the debate over state aid to private schools , which had existed since 1871 and had become central to the public debate leading to the June 1894 elections in Western Australia . With the help of three Catholic members of the Legislative Assembly , he founded the Education Defence League to lobby for the continuation of state aid . The normally mild-mannered priest caused some sensation at a public meeting prior to the election by suggesting violence would result if state aid were lifted . The battle was ultimately lost – the MPs who had supported him lost their seats at the election , and in late 1895 the Government passed a bill bringing the funding arrangement to an end . In August 1894 , he resigned as Vicar General , desiring to retire to New Norcia , but changed his mind thereafter , deciding that the number of Catholics arriving in Western Australia due to the gold rush and the cause of maintaining the private schools justified his continued presence . He became Chairman of the Education Board , a position which he held for a number of years . He was also a patron and benefactor of the Sisters of Mercy and financed St Mary's in Leederville and St Brigid's in West Perth , apparently from his own funds . He became a Monsignor in 1898 and the inaugural parish priest for West Perth in 1901 , residing in the Presbytery of St Brigid's in Fitzgerald Street for the rest of his life . He also became involved with the foundation of the University of Western Australia . The Archives of New Norcia keeps an important group of letters addressed from Bourke to the superiors of the monastery , especially to Bishop Rosendo Salvado OSB . Those offer a real portray of Bourke's personality , personal troubles , opinions and interests on relevant matters for his time . This information is completed by the many references to Bourke found in other letters kept in New Norcia Archives , especially in the correspondence between Bishop Martin Griver and Bishop Rosendo Salvado . </doc>

255,A1,"Thanks to Jamie Oliver our children will soon be getting more nutritious food at school , but it 's time we thought more about what we are feeding them at home and how . Author of parenting bible ' Yes , Please . Thanks ! ' Penny Palmano gives us the low down on family eating . Penny ( centre ) with children Francesca ( 16 ) , Katherine ( 19 ) and Sam ( 17 ) Not only are all our children going to end up obese with diabetes and heart problems but they will have all the social skills of a whelk unless we start to do something about it . And poor nutritional food does not only affect their health but their behaviour as well . We know most children eat far too many fast food products , pre-prepared meals , processed foods , fizzy drinks , snacks , sweets , biscuits , cakes , etc and almost all these products may contain some type of food colouring , preservative , hydrogenated fat , salt and sugar . The additives are a kind of ' food cosmetic make-over ' , disguising poor nutritional food with colour and artificial flavour to make it more attractive to children . But the increased consumption of these foods and the decline in the foods which are good for children , such as fresh vegetables , fruit , fish , meat and cheese , has sadly begun to take its toll . Hyperactivity , moodiness , obesity , long-term health problems and poor intellectual performance can all be connected to a poor diet . Sugar An excess of white sugar can change the normal biochemical ' pathways ' of both , resulting in moody , unmanageable and disruptive children who make everyone's life a misery including their own . Products made mainly from pure white flour will also convert into pure sugar in the body with the same effect . A can of a popular well-known fizzy drink contains both sugar and caffeine , combining two stimulants . If children drink a can at lunchtime the caffeine will still be in their system by the evening and we know what that means , T-R-O-U-B-L - E. These poor children will not be able to sit still at school or around the dinner table and will find it difficult to fall asleep . Help children to cut down their sugar intake by removing the sugar bowl off the table and administering it yourself ( less and less each time ) and replacing fizzy drinks with water or unsweetened fruit juice . Fats Much has been written about fats in the body . It is now widely recognised and accepted that the body does need fat and that there are good and bad fats . Good fats The brain is composed of 60 % fat and needs an abundance of fatty acids from our diet to function effectively . Essential fatty acids are the good fats . They are found in oily fish such as mackerel , tuna , herring , sardines and salmon and nuts , seeds and cold-pressed oils . These fatty acids are essential for the normal development of the brain , eyes and nervous system . Three very good reasons why parents should not put their children on low-fat or fat-free diets . New research from Oxford university has shown that many children suffering from dyslexia , dyspraxia and ADHD ( attention deficit hyperactive disorder ) which affect children's ability to listen , think , speak , sit still and write are suffering from a dietary deficiency of fatty acids . We all want what is best for our children so let 's avoid contributing to their future health problems , hyperactivity , moodiness , poor behaviour and under-performing brain by changing their poor diet . Bring back the family meal Processed ' fast ' foods are not only responsible for these problems . Because children eat them with their fingers they are partly responsible for the demise of the family meal around a table . Now the odd thing is that ever since evolution we have been educating ourselves away from eating with our fingers and grunting . But since the arrival of fast finger foods combined with TV , video , DVD , computer games , we seem to have come full circle and children are again eating with their fingers and grunting ! Funny old world . The break down of the family meal together around a table has sadly taken its toll in many ways . Firstly , children do not know how to hold conversations with adults , they are having no supervision on how to eat or behave correctly at the table , and finally , it is now reported that the absence of the family meal is causing depression and mental-health problems . All this because we eat pizza in front of the telly ??!! Sadly , the lack of family meals together has also been connected to rising crime , depression , stress and mental-health problems among adolescents . And I always thought it was the family meal that caused these problems , with the over-powering father , the stressed out mother and the arguing children . Well , it is up to you to create a happy and harmonious atmosphere at the table , so the children and yourselves will actually look forward to this time . With so many parents both working , time with their children has been greatly reduced . So the family meal is the perfect way of combining talking with them and continuing their social education and really bonding ' as a family ' . By enjoying regular family meals together and having the opportunity to talk , the family will become very close . How to achieve the modern day family meal Under no circumstances have the television on ! It is very unlikely that both parents will be around early enough during the week to eat with toddlers or young children as a family , so make the effort at the weekend . Children are far less likely to be fussy eaters if their parents are eating with them . Never let children eat on their own at a table , always sit and talk to them and encourage their table manners . Rather than saying , ' Do n't hold / talk / eat etc. . ' use the term ' Remember ' .. ' it 's far less reprimanding and much more cajoling . Table manners are just another learning curve . When it is possible , all eat together in the evenings and re-introduce Sunday lunch . Depending on your children's ages and homework load , it is very easy to remain at the table after supper and all play cards or a short board game , which keeps the family together and cuts down on TV and computer time . A double whammy ! Always get a child , whatever age , to help lay the table and , if you have more than one child , let them take it in turns . The meal Whoever is cooking should prepare something that does n ' t take a great deal of last minute attention , so that the majority of time is spent at the table rather than standing at the cooker . But if the thought of having to prepare a meal and cook it sends you rushing for the bottle , prepare something simple like a salad with a ready-roasted chicken and a baked potato . The last thing the family needs is a gin-sodden cook having a nervous breakdown or the children losing their entire set of milk teeth on the first mouthful . Stay calm , have fresh fruit for dessert , followed by cheese and biscuits . Offer children water or unsweetened fruit juice , as high-sugar fizzy drinks will make it harder for them to sit still . Relax The key to a happy time at the table , which is the most beneficial for the children , is for the parents to be relaxed , happy and getting along . So do n't bring up any issues that might spark an argument . If siblings are likely to squabble , do not let them sit next to each other . Tell your children amusing stories and encourage them to do the same . Laughter is great for bonding and relieving stress . Always listen and stay interested in your children's stories and opinions , after all it 's very demoralising for a child ( or adults ) while recounting a story , to watch their audience rapidly losing the will to live . But do n't worry , just because you have started to eat and talk together as a family does n ' t mean that you ca n ' t all enjoy a weekly take-away pizza with your feet up in front of the TV together .

Archives Username : Password : Did you know that if you were a registered user you could add this article to your clipped articles folder ? Editor Denise Tyler tries out the scientific new way to reduce tummy fat - by walking in a vacuum suit . Sounds weird ? It feels a bit weird too , but it does work ! Putting the suit on is harder work than the actual session as it is like a wet suit . You have to strip off and put a thin liner suit on first , then pull on the outer suit which has to fit snugly as the entire thing becomes a vacuum that you then walk on the treadmill in . Tubes are attached to the front of the suit that creat the vacuum and you do get the vague feeling that you now know how cows must feel when they get linked up to a milking machine ! The machine is programmed according to your weight and fitness levels and then you walk opn the treadmill to varying degrees of incline and speed . The idea is to get your heart rate up while the vacuum inside the suit pulls blood into areas it does n ' t usually get into , i . e . t he tumy and hip areas . Normally when you work out , blood gets diverted into your muscles and that 's why it can be difficult to shift stubborn fat on the stomach and hips . This method , strange though it may seem , actually encourages the blood into those areas , thereby using up the fat . And it does work . I 'm just three quarters of the way though my twelve sessions and I 've already lost just over 4cm off my waist and I feel trimmer . My jeans have gone down a belt hole - clear proof that it works ! You have to be prepared to stick with it as you will book up for twelve sessions , three a week of 40 minutes each . By the time you have changed and showered at the end , expect the whole process to take an hour each time . Contact Lisa at SCUK in Brighton on 01273 688830 for further information or visit www . v acunauttraining . c om to find your nearest centre . If you are a fan of Yoga or are curious to know more about it but have n ' t the time to attend classes , the this DVD could well be enjoyable and a time saver . Fenella Lindsell and her husband , co-founders of The Art of Health and Yoga Centre South-West London , opened the centre to offer complementary health treatments and related classes to everyone . They had 3 children during the 7 years at the premises and as a result many of the classes and therapies offered were directed at babies , infants and small children . One of the most successful activities was YogaBugs . YogaBugs classes are targeted at children aged 2 1 ⁄ 2 to 7 years old . Fenella integrated postures into adventures and creative stories which children love . Since YogaBugs was created at The Art it has developed further to help children from all walks of life and is committed to the on going development of Yoga for Children . I tried the new DVD ( pictured ) with my 3 year old and although I had my doubts she would actually be interested or pay attention long enough , we did in fact manage to follow quite alot of the story telling and integrate some of the moves . The nice thing was , we missed bits because we were laughing so much . She has asked to do it again several times and I enjoy taking part with her . I can see that the benefits would increase with age as children learn to replicate the Yoga positions and understand the breathing techniques . I found it actually quite relaxing to simply spend time doing an activity in my own home with my daughter that did n't involve driving anywhere or needing special kit but that left her happy and me feeling like I had actually stretched out a bit . YogaBugs is now a trade marked company and has taught teachers ' nation-wide as well as Europe , America , Australia and Asia . Classes are also run as after school activities or integrated into the school day . To apply for a discounted copy of the YogaBugs DVD , see our </doc>

1291,A12,"Brainstorming Software : Ideafisher Morphs Into Thoughtoffice ThoughtOffice is latest step in the evolution of business creativity solutions that began with IdeaFisher . Portland , OR , ( PRAvenueNW ) -- IdeaFisher came first . It caused quite a stir when it was introduced years ago as a way to bring brainstorming to the personal computer . ThoughtOffice is latest step in the evolution of business creativity solutions that began with IdeaFisher . It adds to Marsh Fisher's original vision a multimedia and web-savvy approach to computerized brainstorming . Marsh may not have fully anticipated the Internet but he saw the possibilities brainstorming software would unleash to creatives worldwide . As far back as the 1970s , Fisher , the founder of Century 21 , began looking for a computer software solution to the challenge of streamlining and improving the brainstorming process . Released in 1988 to critical acclaim , Fisher's breakthrough IdeaFisher ( http://www.thoughtoffice.com ) software quickly became the leading program in its category worldwide . ThoughtOffice , the pedigreed successor to IdeaFisher , was given its present name by Mark Effinger , an innovative "" multrepreneur , "" who developed around Marsh Fisher's program with the express purpose of adapting it to the new circumstances now at work in a computer environment shaped by the innovations of the Internet Age . Effinger added new features and functions to Marsh Fisher's principles and brought to it to market with access to the astonishing resources of the World Wide Web . ThoughtOffice not only built on the platform introduced by IdeaFisher but combined it with other creativity tools such as mindmapping and visual outlining ( http://thoughtoffice.com/blog/?page_id=355 ) . According to Chuck Frey , founder of www.InnovationTools.com , "" ThoughtOffice will help you to take your creative problem-solving skills to the next level . "" Frey adds , "" ThoughtOffice does a great job of leveraging the power of associative thinking ( http://thoughtoffice.com/blog/?page_id=325 ) . Using its rich , interconnected resources , you can follow a long trail of associations without running out of creative steam . Or you can follow a guided problem solving process to reveal fresh ideas and insights . In short , ThoughtOffice is like IdeaFisher on steroids . "" ThoughtOffice also makes ideas easy to understand and share with others -- employees , business associates , or clients -- whether in the same room , or across the web . Building on the original IdeaFisher process , one of the ThoughtOffice program's key functions is the IdeaBrowser , an exclusive brainstorming creativity engine that uses words , phrases , popular search engine phrases and images to help explore ideas quickly and easily . The program is integrated with ThoughtOffice , creating a hybrid of mind mapping and outlining capabilities in an easily accessible mini-browser that jump-starts the creative process .

It also succeeds in bringing together two different types of creative thinking ( http://www.thoughtoffice.com/?page_id=5 ) into one well-designed software program . Its question databases provide a solid foundation for left-brained , systematic problem definition , while its idea-generation tools serve as a catalyst to help the right half of your brain to make new associations and connections , which should lead to more breakthrough ideas . "" The ThoughtOffice programs , which range in price from $ 99 to $ 499 , address 17 distinct areas of expertise . What they have in common is the ability to harness the creative practices to productivity tools usually found only in separate programs . ThoughtOffice "" Bundles "" cover everything from Marketing and Advertising ( http://thoughtoffice.com/blog/?page_id=289 ) techniques to Effective Communication for live and written presentation . eXpertTopic Modules , which were developed with the use of a cadre of experts in creative fields , expand the core ThoughtOffice application and are targeted toward very specific Topics such as Conflict Resolution or Story & Screenplay Writing . The innovative successor to IdeaFisher works as an extension of the brain .

1412,A7,"When it comes to their planning process , many financial institutions choose to stay the course and execute , not sure that an updated planning effort would be worth it . But that 's not the sentiment that resonates among banking industry outperformers , who regard their planning process as essential to achieving business alignment and focused execution . They aim to formulate a plan that illustrates the value proposition that will attract and retain customers , and the strengths that will enable the business to deliver this value to customers , while simultaneously earning an attractive return-on-equity . As a result , and perhaps not surprisingly , these companies enjoy strong organic growth and higher shareholder returns . That makes sense . Their customers are served distinctively , while internally , managers reach decisions effectively and efficiently . However , the majority of financial services executives say that the frustrations that go along with strategic planning are holding them back . We often hear complaints such as , "" Let 's face it ... we call it a strategic planning process , but it 's actually just a financial forecasting effort , "" or , "" Our consultants delivered a fat book full of urban legend assertions , but we would have been better off with a thin one that really got to the essence of what we should do to gain profitable share . "" Characteristics of a Broken Planning Process Ineffective strategic planning processes have several unfortunate outcomes . They often emphasize tactics and not strategy , and then end in a "" cram-down stage "" that leaves a bad taste among participants . As one business manager commented , "" We spent hundreds of man-hours planning a business , and then we were told all of us had 10 % revenue growth and 3 % cost growth bogeys . "" Another common outcome is financial forecasts that are infeasible to fund . When this occurs , business managers will inevitably be asked to reformulate their plans to meet Wall Street's short-term expectations . Problems also occur when too many viewpoints are accommodated under a collegial , "" group-think "" approach . Resulting plans often end up describing broad concepts for how the business will differentiate itself . These compromises accommodate the group , but do not provide the context for making tough allocation of resources decisions – which is , after all , the essence of strategy . Eliminating Low Value , Costly Distractions Plans that claim to offer "" everything for everyone "" are more expensive and run a high risk of becoming "" great intentions , never realized . "" These problems result in a set of tactical initiatives to cut costs and a half-hearted commitment to the revenue plan , exacerbated by a lack of differentiation in the market . Everyone ends up being disappointed – most silently , some vocally . To avoid low value , costly distractions , executives should take a more constructive approach to strategic planning . Spend time developing and gaining consensus on a more focused value proposition and determine the implications for prioritizing initiatives , while deprioritizing others . Steps for Effective Planning Devising a strategic plan that ultimately aligns a company's business segments , and propels organic growth and shareholder returns requires an internal analysis of the institution and its objectives in the marketplace . Call it a four-part process , in which executives will first , clearly identify and communicate financial goals to their company and ask senior management to answer fundamental questions such as , "" why would prospects choose to bank with us ? "" Then , executives must review their new value-driven plan and commit to making it the basis for the company's future strategy and eliminate discretionary investments and activities that are not central to the strategy . 1 . Spell It Out : At the outset , executive management should be clear in communicating the goals for the corporation , including any "" must have "" financial objectives . Ideally , this step should also include guidance for each line of business . For example , one unit may be challenged to grow faster than the market while maintaining its profitability ; another may be told to fix its low margins before emphasizing growth . 2 . The Litmus Test : As each unit prepares its strategy , management should make sure that each strategy includes consideration of the fundamental issues that , once resolved , will guide decisions on allocation of resources and will focus execution . One way to help business heads and planners understand how to approach planning is to adopt an entrepreneur's mindset . Produce a strategy that would stand up to the scrutiny of an independent venture capital or private equity firm that you wish to attract an investment from by addressing the following four areas : W hat the business will achieve : Although this is a derivative of the strategy and should be completed last , it 's is often the first topic to be discussed with executive management in the strategy review . It 's mostly composed of financial goals , but the best plans will also highlight the competencies that are important to the business' competitiveness . Where the business will compete : Examine the criteria to be used to decide where in the competitive landscape to focus . Typically , this is based on analysis of growth and ROE potential . These criteria should guide specific recommendations for the types of customers to target , the products and channels to emphasize , and the geographies on which to focus . How the business will win : One of the most critically important steps in strategic planning is determining how the business will be successful . If it 's not compelling , the value of planning will be substantially compromised . The strategy must be as straightforward and specific as possible in describing the value proposition that will motivate customers to do business with your bank versus competitors . Once defined , a companion section should describe how value will be provided at a cost that will enable the business to generate attractive economics . Finally , if acquisitions are envisioned , this section should explain their contribution to the strategy and how the acquisition premium will be earned back . · How the business will be managed : It is important to highlight those aspects of the organization design , management processes , performance measures , culture , and incentives that will be aligned with the strategy . Someone reading this section should be able to understand how the recommended approach will facilitate achievement of the goals . It is critically important to align the metrics and incentive plan . Without such alignment , people will continue to do what makes their wallets bulge , and you might as well delete the strategy before you even print it out . 3 . Recap : At this point , reviews should be held with senior management . Such reviews should begin with a discussion of the proposed value proposition : Will customers be motivated ? Business managers should be asked , "" Okay , let 's pretend I am a prospect in your target market . Tell me in a straightforward manner ... why should I do business with you instead of your competitors ? "" If the answer to this question is not compelling , the business needs to rethink its value proposition . The worst case occurs when the business seeks to be distinctive in too many dimensions , e.g. , convenience , service quality , price , and segmentation . This is the state of affairs in most banks that are losing share . More subtle , but also problematic , is deciding that , for example , "" We will win with superior service "" without defining precisely what aspects of service will be distinctive . This leads to a false sense of consensus that later breaks down as management grapples with a myriad of investment proposals and activities to be approved which all appear consistent with a strategy that is too broad . What is really needed is more precise resolution of whether the service strategy will focus on having fewer errors , showing customers respect , offering superior hours for convenience , being hassle-free and easy to do business with , offering more personalized banking , etc. Once the answer to the "" why should I do business with you "" question is concise and convincing , then the business team should be asked , "" Now tell me how you are going to deliver this extra value to customers and still achieve an attractive return on equity . That is , what will be the behind-the-scenes competencies that will underpin success ? "" Present the plan as if to a venture capitalist who is being asked to invest It is essential to achieve clarity and buy-in on the answers to the two fundamental questions noted above during a friendly but rigorous scrutiny of the strategy . If full buy-in is achieved , execution alignment can be accomplished . Even 75 % buy-in will not be enough , as the 25 % outliers will hinder efficient decision-making , delay execution , add complexity , and cause the organization to be more confused than efficient . Buy-in failure essentially guarantees ineffective execution . So , the quality of the answers to these questions is the critical determinant of whether ( i ) the effort is strategic , ( ii ) top management will fund , and ( iii ) the initiatives will lead to focused action . 4 . Talk the talk and walk the walk : Finally , and ideally after they are approved by top management , strategic plans should become the basis for next year's financial plan . Only after the strategic plan has been challenged , refined , and accepted should budget detail for its first year be constructed . Creating the budget at this point is more efficient , as it is now less likely to need revision , and adds value by further validating – or challenging – the near-term aspects of the strategic plan . It is also vital that periodic reviews include a discussion of strategic milestones that are not financial in nature , i.e. , the key initiatives and leading indicators that will drive the financials . More quality thinking ... less make-work Ensuring that these four steps are in place will go a long way toward making a planning process successful . At best-practice institutions , the whole planning process is frequently so well honed that it can start a mere four to five months before the fiscal year-end . Such institutions often start in mid-August , with the initial top-down corporate plan developed in September and the individual business planning cycle running from mid-September to November . Budgets come to their conclusion in early to mid-December . Boards are presented with and asked to approve strategic and financial plans in mid - to late December , and receive the final budget in January . Does this "" best practice "" approach require more effort ? Certainly it mandates disciplined thinking about your customer needs , your value proposition relative to that of the competition and how you will deliver that value at an attractive return . However , if there is less make-work , the odds of a failed process are dramatically reduced . </doc>

233,A1,"Agenda Children and armed conflict Report of the Secretary-General on children and armed conflict ( S / 2002 / 1299 ) The meeting resumed at 3.15 p. m . The President ( spoke in French ) : I should like to inform the Council that I have received a letter dated 14 January 2003 from the Permanent Observer of Palestine to the United Nations , which will be issued as document S / 2003 / 45 , and which reads as follows . "" I have the honour to request that , in accordance with its previous practice , the Security Council invite the Permanent Observer of Palestine to the United Nations to participate in the meeting of the Security Council being held today , Tuesday , 14 January 2003 , on children and armed conflict . "" I propose , with the consent of the Council , to invite the Permanent Observer of Palestine to participate in the debate , in accordance with the Council's provisional rules of procedure and with previous practice in this regard . There being no objection , it is so decided . I invite the Permanent Observer of Palestine to take the seat reserved for him at the side of the Council Chamber . The next speaker inscribed on my list is the representative of Greece . I invite him to take a seat at the Council table and to make his statement . Mr. Vassilakis ( Greece ) : As this is my first intervention before the Security Council this year , I would like to congratulate you , Sir , on your assumption of the presidency . I would like also to extend my warm congratulations to the representatives of the new members of the Council , namely Angola , Chile , Germany , Pakistan and Spain . I have the honour to speak on behalf of the European Union . The acceding States – Cyprus , the Czech Republic , Estonia , Hungary , Latvia , Lithuania , Malta , Poland , Slovakia and Slovenia – the countries of Central and Eastern Europe associated with the European Union – Bulgaria and Romania – as well as the European Free Trade Association country of the European Economic Area Iceland align themselves with this statement . It is a cruel fact that armed conflicts affect a large number of children in many parts of the world . Many of them are uprooted from their homes , maimed or killed . Others are orphaned , abused or exploited . Girls are especially at risk of being subjected to sexual violence during violent conflicts , including rape and enslavement . Children are recruited , trained and forced to kill . Malnutrition among children increases rapidly because of falling food production and displacement . Infant and child mortality rates rise dramatically . Access to schooling is seriously restricted . This means that the lives of generations of children growing up in conflict-affected areas are hampered in a multitude of ways that hinder their physical , social and emotional growth . We risk losing generations due to conflict . This is not only a human tragedy of immense proportions ; it is also a tragedy for the countries concerned . Those children are needed to ensure the continued development of their countries . We must face this challenge and ensure that we act as swiftly as possible . The European Union was satisfied that Security Council resolution 1379 ( 2001 ) clearly reflected the Secretary-General's concise report on children and armed conflict ( S / 2001 / 852 ) . The resolution is a valuable example of Council engagement in enhancing the rights of the child . The European Union calls on all parties to armed conflicts to respect international law relating to the rights and protection of children . Only by concerted international efforts can we ensure improved protection of the rights of the child . We also call on Member States to put an end to impunity for war crimes and other serious crimes perpetrated against children . Last February , the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the involvement of children in armed conflict entered into force . The Optional Protocol constitutes a remarkable step forward in the international community's efforts to put an end to the recruitment of children into armed conflict . The European Union urges States that have not yet done so to ratify and implement the Optional Protocol . Another important step was the inclusion of a provision in the Statute of the International Criminal Court classifying the enlistment of children as a war crime . That covers both the conscription and enlistment of children under the age of 15 years into any kind of armed force or group and making them participate actively in hostilities . We urge all States that have not yet done so to consider ratifying and fully implementing the Statute . At the General Assembly special session on children , children told us that they wanted us to implement the Convention on the Rights of the Child . They are impatient , and for good reason : an enormous gap exists between the good intentions of international treaties and the real-life conditions of poverty , neglect and involvement in armed conflict . Millions of children worldwide are exploited . In spite of progress in some areas , much remains to be done . The European Union will seek in all appropriate forums to reinforce international action against recruiting and using children in armed conflict . We will focus on early warning of violations of children's rights , but we will also look at improving monitoring and rehabilitation activities of the United Nations at the regional , bilateral and local levels . Furthermore , we will insist on special protection for girls in armed conflict and on more effective measures to fight impunity . The European Union wishes to express its support for the work of the Office of the Special Representative for Children and Armed Conflict . The Office has done impressive work in raising worldwide awareness and mobilizing official and public support for the protection of children affected by armed conflict . We also recognize the importance of the work carried out by the United Nations Children's Fund , the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights . It is also worth mentioning the United Nations Development Fund for Women and its report entitled "" Women , War and Peace "" . It is essential that the endeavours of those organizations receive adequate support from Member States – although it still remains the responsibility of Member States to implement all obligations flowing from international treaties and instruments . When discussing last year's resolution , the European Union welcomed the important tasks set out for the agencies , funds and programmes of the United Nations . We believe that the funds and programmes , as part of their assistance programmes , can contribute significantly to promoting the rights and the protection of children , as well as to ensuring the rehabilitation of children affected by armed conflict . The needs of children in conflict situations are many . At the same time , we should recognize the unimaginable resources that children and young people possess even in the most difficult of circumstances . Apart from being victims , they also have the potential to contribute to reconciliation and conflict resolution . The European Union wants to welcome the efforts of the Secretary-General , and of the Council itself , to integrate the protection of children into the mandates of United Nations peacekeeping and peace-building operations . Including child protection staff in peacekeeping and peace-building operations is a promising new element . We would welcome a comprehensive assessment of the scope and effectiveness of the response of the United Nations , including recommendations for strengthening , mainstreaming and sustaining activities related to protecting children in armed conflict . The promotion of peace is the overriding responsibility of all countries , as well as of the Council . But as long as armed conflicts are a reality , we have a duty to promote the protection , as well as to defend the rights , of their most vulnerable victims : the children . The United Nations system as a whole has a strong role to play in this regard , and we owe it to the children of the world to mobilize its full potential . The President ( spoke in French ) : The next speaker inscribed on my list is the representative of Bahrain . I invite him to take a seat at the Council table and to make his statement . Mr. Saleh ( Bahrain ) ( spoke in Arabic ) : First , allow me to congratulate you , Sir , on your assumption of the presidency of the Security Council for the month of January . I also congratulate your predecessor , the Permanent Representative of Colombia , on his presidency of the Council . I would further like to take this opportunity to express to all my best wishes for the new year and my hope that it will bring peace and security to all peoples . For several years , the Security Council has devoted part of its work to the consideration in public meetings of issues such as the protection of civilians in armed conflict , children and armed conflict and other questions . We welcome that trend in the Council , which allows non-members of the Council to take part in the discussions on such important issues . It enhances transparency in the Council and makes the Council more effective in dealing with international issues , especially those that might threaten international peace and security . There are two major reasons for focusing attention on children and emphasizing the need to protect them in armed conflict . The first is that children are part of civil society . Accordingly , they must be protected as stipulated by the provisions of the Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949 relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War . The second reason is that children are the most vulnerable sector of society and are therefore the sector in greatest need of protection and attention . Since the beginning of the Council's debate on children and armed conflict , in 1998 , the Council has adopted several resolutions and presidential statements on the protection of children in armed conflict , such as resolutions 1261 ( 1999 ) , 1314 ( 2000 ) and 1379 ( 2001 ) . The United Nations , through its various bodies and activities , has helped to strengthen the way in which certain international concerns on the issue of children in armed conflict are addressed , notably by making child protection a component of peacekeeping and post-conflict peace-building missions . Despite all this , we still need to try harder to ensure the effective implementation of , and full compliance with , resolutions and international instruments concerning the protection of children . In that connection , my country would like to express the following concerns . First , when considering humanitarian issues such as the impact of armed conflict on children , we should try to be objective and credible and should try to avoid using double standards . It is absolutely necessary that the Security Council deal with the status of Palestinian children affected by the Israeli occupation of their territories . Secondly , it might be necessary during future consideration of this item to invite competent bodies such as the United Nations Children's Fund and the International Labour Organization to take part in the Council's deliberations in order to take advantage of their practical experience in this area . In that context , we welcome the participation of Ms. Carol Bellamy and her important statement on the issue . Thirdly , the Council should consider following up the resolutions it adopts , especially those on the issue now being considered , by adopting methods and means acceptable to members of the Council . Fourthly , it is also necessary to increase coordination and cooperation among the Security Council , the General Assembly and the Economic and Social Council . Such coordination would increase the effectiveness of those organs when dealing with this issue of common interest . Coordination among them would prevent duplicating efforts and taking contradictory measures . The Security Council can play an essential role in the protection of children in armed conflict , especially through its peacekeeping missions . Likewise , the Economic and Social Council could play a primary role in post-conflict peace-building . As for the General Assembly , its principal role could be a legislative one , especially through the relevant international conventions and by making recommendations , in particular at its special sessions and other special events . Finally , we express our hope that the deliberations of the Security Council on children and armed conflict will evolve into a concrete , practical concern and that the Council resolutions will be applied on the ground with objectivity and without double standards . Recruitment of children , their sexual exploitation , the violation of their rights and the impact of foreign occupation on them are all considerations we should take into account in order to help them and to eliminate these phenomena . The Council plays an important role in this regard . The President ( spoke in French ) : The next speaker on my list is the representative of Switzerland . I invite him to take a seat at the Council table and to make his statement . Mr. Staehelin ( Switzerland ) ( spoke in French ) : May I begin by congratulating France on assuming once again the presidency of the Security Council and wishing you and the new members of the Security Council every success in carrying out the tasks awaiting you . Switzerland welcomes this annual Security Council debate on children and armed conflict , as it represents one of my country's priorities in matters of human security . Switzerland takes note with satisfaction of the Secretary-General's report ( S / 2002 / 1299 ) and considers it to be a valuable reference document on action undertaken in the United Nations over the last year to respond to challenges with regard to the rights of the child in armed conflicts . I thank the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Children and Armed Conflict and the Executive Director of the United Nations Children's Fund for their respective presentations . Switzerland expresses with conviction its solidarity with the recommendations formulated by Austria on behalf of the Human Security Network and is convinced of the Security Council's essential role in their implementation . Switzerland reiterates its support for the international community's numerous current efforts to reinforce the protection of the civilian population in times of armed conflict . Children are particularly vulnerable , and the impact of conflict on their rights and well-being can be felt at many levels and in various ways : attacks on their rights to survival and development , attacks on their physical integrity , attacks on their rights to education and health , and the destruction of their family structures and of their social and community ties . Far too many of them also find themselves refugees or internally displaced , orphaned or unaccompanied . In the face of such situations , Switzerland particularly recalls the importance of respecting the 1949 Geneva Conventions and their two Additional Protocols of 1977 , in which specific provisions for the protection of and assistance to children are incorporated . As underlined in the Secretary-General's report , 2002 saw the entry into force of two major international instruments : the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the involvement of children in armed conflicts , and the Statute of the International Criminal Court . Switzerland , which ratified the Optional Protocol last June , is committed to pursuing its efforts with a view to ensuring its universal ratification as soon as possible . It hopes that all States that have not yet done this will follow its example by depositing a declaration , as stipulated in paragraph 2 of article 3 , indicating 18 years as the age limit for voluntary recruitment . The entry into force of the Rome Statute represents a major step towards an end to impunity . Switzerland welcomes the steps taken by the Secretary-General's Special Representative to ensure that the International Criminal Court , as well as the Special Tribunal for Sierra Leone , include particular considerations regarding juvenile law into their regulations and procedure . Switzerland shares the Secretary-General's opinion that the current major challenge resides in the implementation of these international instruments , which , by the standards they set , propose new prospects for action . In this respect , it would have been desirable for the report to formulate suggestions for concrete actions to be taken by the Security Council itself as well as by the United Nations system as a whole , and by each of its Member States individually . Switzerland emphasizes the innovative and welcome contribution that resolution 1379 ( 2001 ) represents , particularly the establishment of a list of parties to armed conflicts that recruit or use children in violation of the international provisions meant to protect them . The political importance of this list is undeniable , and it should certainly be maintained . However , its true value will become apparent only when the Security Council has defined the actions it plans to undertake in this respect . In this regard , Switzerland invites the Security Council to consider the following recommendations . We suggest that this list be updated on a regular basis . Include in the list all countries and situations of armed conflict which involve the problem of recruitment and use of child soldiers and which appear on the Security Council's agenda . Include on the list all other countries and conflict situations which the Council may deem necessary . Establish an ongoing dialogue with those Governments named in the list and promote the relevant instruments among the armed non-State actors . Identify other criteria , in addition to the recruitment and use of children , for developing the list , keeping in mind the magnitude of the impact of armed conflicts on children . At the conceptual level , the work accomplished by non-governmental organizations on this matter could constitute a particularly valuable contribution . To conclude , I wish to recall the commitments made by the international community in the document "" A world fit for children "" , adopted at the General Assembly's special session on children ( resolution S-27 / 2 ) . In this regard , Switzerland supports the activities to create awareness and to integrate children's rights in United Nations activities as a whole and encourages the Organization to pursue and intensify them at all levels . My country welcomes the implementation of guiding principles for conduct for all United Nations staff , which are essential to ensuring that the behaviour of humanitarian personnel vis-à-vis its beneficiaries is beyond reproach , and to prevent abuse . We further invite the Security Council to continue including child protection advisers in its peacekeeping operations . They play a key role in ensuring that the rights and specific needs of girls and boys be taken into account and respected . The President ( spoke in French ) : I thank the representative of Switzerland for the kind words addressed to my country . Mr. Laurin ( Canada ) ( spoke in French ) : First of all , I should like to thank you , Sir , for convening this open debate on children and armed conflict . ( spoke in English ) Given the present international context , and as we approach the one-year anniversary of the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the involvement of children in armed conflict , we are reminded that this is highly relevant work for the Security Council . I wish to begin by expressing my appreciation to the Secretary-General for his substantive report ( S / 2002 / 1299 ) . In particular , we were pleased to see specific conflict situations mentioned in the report as well as in the annex . What is clear is that , while progress has been made , the work of the Council is far from complete . Ongoing child abduction , conscription and the use of children in armed conflict make the work of the Security Council all the more urgent . We welcome the Security Council 's acting as a channel for Member States to receive information about the impact of conflict on children , and we would urge the Council in future to call for recommendations for effective solutions to prevent the recruitment and end the use of child soldiers . It is incumbent on us to move away from general statements to specific action and to build a system of accountability that can not be ignored . Now that Governments and armed groups using children in armed conflict have been publicly named , the challenge to the Security Council is to make these parties accountable . This requires genuine political will and resources . I congratulate the Secretary-General for highlighting this reality in his report . I would like also to congratulate the Special Representative of the Secretary-General , Mr. Otunnu , as well as the United Nations Children's Fund ( UNICEF ) , in partnership with non-governmental organizations ( NGOs ) and other United Nations agencies , for their efforts in developing mechanisms for integrating child protection into the peace and security agenda . I would like to pay special tribute to the critical work of civil society . We must continue to collaborate with those organizations that are on the front line of efforts to ensure effective monitoring and to meet the protection and assistance needs of war-affected children and their communities . In particular , Canada welcomed the report of the Watchlist on Children and Armed Conflict in November of last year , funded in part by the Canadian Human Security Programme . That report illustrates clearly how much work still needs to be done with respect to monitoring , reporting and follow-up action before , during and after armed conflict . It goes without saying that Canada associates itself fully with the statement that the representative of Austria will make on behalf of the Human Security Network . Canada made commitments at the Winnipeg Conference , and we fully intend to respect them . For example , the Canadian International Development Agency has committed $ 122 million to child protection programmes and $ 2 million to child protection research , including several projects on war-affected children . Through our Human Security Programme , we sponsor youth outreach and education initiatives through War Child Canada , an organization that provides humanitarian assistance to war-affected children . We believe that the efforts of Canada and of others have helped turn the corner on monitoring and reporting . Now we would like to see action taken when the evidence is persuasive , as it is in the Secretary-General's report . To this end , Canada calls on the Security Council to undertake field missions in the specific conflict situations mentioned in the Secretary-General's report and in particular closely to scrutinize the action of the parties identified in the list annexed to the report . Such field missions should include consultations with local NGOs , women's organizations , youth groups and children . The Security Council should ask for a six-month interim report , evaluate progress made on these situations , and commit itself to follow up in one year's time on the parties named in this year's discussion . Ultimately , if there is no real progress , the Security Council must consider what actions it must take to give effect to its decisions , including targeted sanctions . At present , only countries on the Security Council's agenda are mentioned in the Secretary-General's report . This was a first step – one that should be followed by the inclusion of all conflicts in future reports . For the sake of the children who are the victims of such crimes , Canada believes this debate should be made an annual event . Recommendations from relevant resolutions , namely 1379 ( 2001 ) , 1261 ( 1999 ) and 1314 ( 2000 ) , should be assessed . In addition , Council accountability for specific actions to enhance protection and assistance for girls and boys affected by armed conflict and their communities could be reinforced . The issue of children and armed conflict is linked to the broader agenda item on protection of civilians recently debated by the Council . The Security Council and the broader United Nations system in its entirety must ensure that these agenda items remain linked . Although Council members agreed to consider the protection of civilians , including the rights and needs of children , in country-specific reports and resolutions , it would appear to us that this has not been done in every case . We call for renewed efforts towards this end . ( spoke in French ) Discussions on small arms , disarmament , demobilization and reintegration processes and access should address directly the implications for children and should pay special attention to the situation of the girl child . One promising outcome of the United Nations Conference on the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects was its recognition of the impact of small arms on children . While this represents progress , children continue to fall victim to the ravages caused by the proliferation and reckless use of small arms . We commend the Economic Community of West African States for having launched its child protection unit within its secretariat . That is a very important initiative that we hope will serve as a model for other regional organizations in the integration of child protection into their work . We encourage United Nations agencies to continue their efforts to improve training on children's rights for United Nations staff and to evaluate lessons learned from incorporating child protection into peacekeeping operations . We believe that the six core principles of the Inter-Agency Standing Committee Task Force on Protection from Sexual Exploitation and Abuse in Humanitarian Crises should be incorporated into the mandate of all peacekeeping operations , including the prohibition of sexual activity with children . In addition , HIV / AIDS education and HIV testing and counselling services should be offered to all United Nations peacekeepers . Impunity , humanitarian access and physical protection , with specific consideration of sexual exploitation , all are urgent issues that remain unresolved , although they fall squarely within the Council's purview and should be addressed . Canadian representatives were pleased that very serious crimes committed against children , including the use of child soldiers to participate actively in hostilities , were included in the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court ( ICC ) . This was a significant development in international law to protect children from the devastating effects of armed conflict . The ICC is an important additional international mechanism to protect children's rights . We call on those States that have not yet done so to ratify or to accede to the ICC Statute . All States should welcome the fact that the ICC will contribute to ending impunity for serious crimes against children . In the outcome document of the special session on children , held in May 2002 , States renewed their commitment to strengthening the protection of children affected by armed conflict . The Security Council has a key role to play in ensuring that that commitment is translated into action . Canada firmly believes that all our actions must be guided by the principles of the Convention on the Rights of the Child , which remains the principal instrument of reference and , indeed , the fundamental legislative basis for achieving children's rights . The primacy of the Convention needs to be strongly reflected in our words and actions aimed at improving the lives of children . The three landmark Security Council resolutions on children and armed conflict – 1261 ( 1999 ) , 1314 ( 2000 ) and 1379 ( 2001 ) – have outlined steps to be taken , actors to be engaged and mechanisms required to increase the protection of the rights of war-affected children and their communities . Progress has been made , but much more needs to be done . The Security Council has a key role to play . War-affected children have the right to expect that the Council will do its part to the fullest extent possible . The President ( spoke in French ) : The next speaker on my list is the representative of the Philippines . I invite him to take a seat at the Council table and to make his statement . Mr. Manalo ( Philippines ) : At the outset , I wish to congratulate you , Sir , and your country on your chairmanship and leadership of the Council this month . I also wish to express my delegation's appreciation for this opportunity to speak on this important topic and to thank the Secretary-General for his report on this very important issue . We join others today in underscoring the need for continued and concerted actions at both the national and international levels to protect children in armed conflict . We thank the Secretary-General , the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Children and Armed Conflict and the Executive Director of the United Nations Children's Fund ( UNICEF ) for their respective statements this morning . It is estimated that there are 300,000 child soldiers in the world , one fourth of whom are in the East Asia and Pacific region . Most of these children were forcibly recruited because of social and cultural pressures or were simply abducted outright . Poverty has also been a factor leading to child recruitment . Those not recruited or abducted have also been victims of displacement due to armed conflict . Instead of being in school , these children have served in the battleground , fighting , or as messengers and couriers , as cooks , spies or sex slaves . That these children have been and are involved in wars , growing up in an environment of destruction , denies the world a promising future . One of the most important milestones for protecting children from involvement in hostilities was set last February with the entry into force of the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the involvement of children in armed conflict . It was indeed a positive step , a major step , and will hopefully end the use of children under 18 years old from serving as soldiers or directly participating in hostilities . The Philippines ratified the Optional Protocol last April , and it has also ratified the 1990 International Labour Organization Convention No. 182 concerning the elimination of the worst forms of child labour . We view these two international instruments as setting strict standards for preventing the recruitment of children as child soldiers . Children are also protected by the Philippines legal framework . Our Constitution provides that the State shall defend the rights of children and especially protect them from all forms of neglect , abuse and other conditions prejudicial to their development . In this regard , Philippines law provides that children shall not be recruited for fighting and that they should be given priority during evacuation as a result of armed conflict . In recognition of their special situation , children arrested for reasons related to armed conflict , whether as combatants , couriers , guides or spies , are entitled to release on recognizance within 24 hours to the custody of the Government or any responsible member of the community as determined by the courts . We welcome the fact that the Security Council has taken steps to address the matter of protection of and assistance to children in situations of armed conflict , particularly through resolutions 1261 ( 1999 ) , 1314 ( 2000 ) and 1379 ( 2001 ) . The Council must continue to be seized with this issue and take every opportunity to reaffirm its collective commitment to protect children and prevent their involvement in armed conflict by mainstreaming this concern in its relevant decisions . Post-conflict reconstruction programmes must also be tailored to assist children affected by armed conflict . In the case of girls and young women , who are often the targets of sexual abuse , abduction and forced recruitment , rehabilitation services are needed to deal with their experiences and assist them in reintegrating society . In the case of displaced children , aside from basic food , medical care and education , counselling and family reunification must be important components of their reintegration programme . For countries that have emerged from conflict , it is important that any disarmament , demobilization and reintegration programme include the demobilization and rehabilitation of former child soldiers . Such programmes must distinguish the post-conflict needs of girl soldiers from those of their male counterparts . This will ensure that the provisions for demobilization and reintegration needs are directly related to the specific ways that children have been abused or traumatized during a conflict . The healing and reintegration of children affected by armed conflict should be a priority of any reconstruction effort and , as such , must be backed by sufficient resources . This is especially due to the necessity of finding alternative peaceful ways for children to develop and have a more meaningful future . Children are our future . We must all help to create a world fit for them . At the very least , we must protect them from the horrors of armed conflict . The President ( spoke in French ) : The next speaker on my list is the representative of Monaco . I invite him to take a seat at the Council table and to make his statement . Mr. Boisson ( Monaco ) ( spoke in French ) : I am particularly pleased to see you , Sir , in the Security Council presidency this month , and to congratulate you . Once again , we come to the Security Council to plead a cause which affects the human being in his very nature , as well as in his future . The recruitment of children in armed conflicts is an intolerable and unacceptable violation of the rights of the child , a violation clearly condemned by the universal morality to which the States of our Organization adhere . Like many heads of delegation , the Chairman of the delegation of Monaco to the special session of the General Assembly on children , His Serene Highness Crown Prince Albert , last May referred to this painful issue , which , naturally and quite wisely , was fortunately taken into account in the very important final declaration adopted on that occasion . The Secretary-General's report of 26 November 2002 ( S / 2002 / 1299 ) had already alerted us to the difficulties which the Under-Secretary-General , Mr. Olara Otunnu , had encountered in carrying out his lofty mission , but also , we are pleased to see , to the undeniable progress achieved , which is extremely encouraging . This public meeting of the Security Council , in this first month of the year 2003 , under the French presidency , of which we appreciate both the initiative and quality , gives us the opportunity to express our unreserved support for the Secretary-General and his Special Representative , and the opportunity to encourage them to continue and strengthen their action in favour of this noble cause . As the principal organ under the United Nations Charter with responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security , the Security Council indeed urges us to undertake some soul-searching that should lead us to take decisive decisions in order to put an end to the painful situation of child soldiers . These are tragic and pathetic situations that , beyond the emotions they give rise to , undermine the principles of humanity on which our cooperation is built and on which rest our hopes and our deepest convictions . Using children as a tool of war , of suffering and death , is intolerable . This idea revolts and disturbs us . As a crime against children , a crime of genocide , a war crime , a crime against humanity , the use of children in armed conflicts makes it incumbent on the international community and the Security Council , which is its authorized voice , to embark on a new stage . The report of the Secretary-General and his message today , and the message that his Special Representative has just given us , as well as that of Ms. Carol Bellamy , Executive Director of UNICEF , emphasize the urgency and need for action . The Principality of Monaco , on the initiative of both its highest sovereign authorities and its people , has consistently put the protection of childhood , physical as well as moral , at the forefront of its concerns and national and international commitments . The public authorities have devoted many efforts to this . Many non-governmental organizations , with the support of the royal family , the Government and the parliament , are also making unflagging efforts to contribute to the protection of children in danger and the improvement of their plight , particularly when it is affected by poverty , violence and a destructive lack of a future . An international law symposium , which will be followed by a public meeting with civil society , is now being prepared in Monaco on the initiative of the World Association of Friends of Children ( AMADE ) . Effectively headed by Crown Prince Albert , who since May 1993 has chaired the Monaco delegation at the General Assembly sessions , and by Her Royal Highness Princess Caroline of Hanover , this initiative should make possible a better grasp of the concepts and the legal contexts involved nationally and internationally in the protection of children , as well as the ways of facilitating legal proceedings and strengthening sanctions in the case of serious , flagrant and repeated violations of their basic rights and fundamental freedoms . The symposium should contribute to increasing awareness , which is needed now more than ever on the global level , of this serious issue , given that we now have today – with the entry into force of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court and the two Optional Protocols to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child – indispensable specific instruments to combat this ultimate form of barbarism that affects children . The Convention on the Rights of the Child , as well as its Optional Protocol on children in armed conflict – which the Principality has signed and ratified – and the very valuable experience gained by the international criminal tribunals will indeed be the basis for this exercise in reflection , as will the role of the International Criminal Court , which is awaited with great hope . This will involve , without academic disputes , trying to determine , in a realistic way , the most efficient legal and judicial ways and means to allow for prosecuting , beyond time and space , the most serious crimes against children . The report of the Secretary-General on children and armed conflict will also be , of course , at the heart of the symposium and the meeting with civil society . The Monaco authorities , which have contributed to the special fund for children involved in armed conflict since its inception , pay due tribute to the activities of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General in this area . They greatly welcome the provisions that he advocates , given that they are without a doubt a decisive stage in the protection of children during armed conflict , internal as well as international , and regardless of the parties involved . In particular , we note with satisfaction the list of parties involved in conflicts contained in the report's annex – parties against which there is proof that they continue to recruit and arm minors and use them without restraint or caution in situations of extremely brutal hostilities . The resolution to be adopted at the initiative of France at the end of this exchange of views should grant all the necessary legitimacy and authority to its provisions to follow up specifically on the previous Security Council resolutions , in particular resolutions 1261 ( 1999 ) , 1314 ( 2000 ) and 1379 ( 2001 ) . Defining as a war crime by the Statute of the International Criminal Court of forced recruitment of children under the age of 15 in hostilities , including in internal conflicts , as well as attacks on hospitals and schools , or serious , repeated sexual violent acts , should help us . This definition is decisive insofar as the Convention on the Non-Applicability of Statutory Limitations to War Crimes and Crimes against Humanity , of 26 November 1968 , explicitly stipulates in article I that war crimes and crimes against humanity are without statutory limitation , like genocide , which the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide , of 9 December 1948 , considers as a crime against the rights of nations , jus gentium , whether committed in time of peace or in time of war . I would recall furthermore that article VI of the Convention on genocide had already provided for an international penal tribunal as may have jurisdiction over such crimes , and article VII stipulated that such crimes would not be considered political for the purpose of extradition , which would also be agreed by the contracting parties in accordance with their laws and treaties in force . Article II ( c ) of this same instrument also considers – and this is noteworthy – that genocide also extends to an act of forced transfer of children from one national , ethnic , racial or religious group to another , committed with intent to destroy them . Today , as the Secretary-General stated in his report , the true challenge lies in the implementation and the effective application of existing international instruments and norms . However , it is undeniable and encouraging to note , undoubtedly for the first time in such a report , references to Governments , paramilitary organizations and armed groups that are guilty of kidnapping children and training them , despite their will , to become war criminals , murderers and torturers . We now know the perpetrators of these crimes , or at least some among them . We have the legal means to prosecute and punish them . Without a doubt , we must see to it that there is the political will to act and find the financial and law enforcement resources to intervene effectively . Undoubtedly also , we must strengthen the programmes for reinsertion of child soldiers and develop new ones , while seeing to it that these programmes become integral elements of any post-conflict reconstruction and development projects . The appointment of advisers in certain of the programmes under way seems to be bearing fruit and therefore is an interesting path to pursue and encourage . As the Secretary-General has also recalled , the creation during armed conflicts of protected zones in which women , children , the elderly , the wounded and the disarmed can find asylum and protection is one solution to impose . It is a solution that the highest authorities in Monaco have always wished to see encouraged and promoted by the United Nations . Such zones should benefit from secure access routes to allow for the intervention of humanitarian personnel . Ahmadou Kouroma , who has recounted his adventures as a child soldier in a very beautiful novel that received several literary prizes , clearly shows that reinsertion is always possible and often crowned with success . For , as this author wrote of his mother , "" after 30 years of suffering , smoke and tears , there was still something marvellous in the hollows of her face "" . The moving observation by this child , a criminal despite himself who found again his place in human society , should lead us to be optimistic and give us , with hope , the will to act that naturally follows from this . In that spirit of optimism and hope , we must have the courage of our convictions and take the necessary decisions in order to ensure that the recommendations of the Secretary-General are effectively followed up and his expectations fulfilled . The clear and unambiguous desire of the Government of the Principality is quite clear in this regard : justice must be done , and international law , which deals with this question extensively and in detail , must triumph so that the murderers of children are punished for their crime – the worst crime of all : turning children into criminals and transforming their innocence into barbarism . Here , we believe that there are three crucial elements . First , when internal judicial proceedings have been exhausted , or in cases where such proceedings have not been used , the competence of international bodies , in particular the International Criminal Court , should naturally come into play . Secondly , crimes and violations against girls and boys of less than 15 years of age should not be excluded from the criminal definitions contained in the Statute of the International Criminal Court as they relate to the crime of genocide , crimes against humanity and war crimes , under articles 6 , 7 and 8 of the Statute respectively . Thirdly , it should be possible to apply , without reservation , the principles of the Convention on the Non-Applicability of the Statute of Limitations to War Crimes and Crimes Against Humanity of 26 November 1968 , as well as , when justified , those of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide of 9 December 1948 . The President ( spoke in French ) : The next speaker inscribed on my list is the representative of Rwanda . I invite him to take a seat at the Council table and to make his statement . Mr. Muvunyi ( Rwanda ) : We would like to congratulate you , Sir , on your assumption of the presidency of the Security Council for the month of January and to extend our congratulations to the representatives of the new members of the Security Council – Angola , Chile , Germany , Pakistan and Spain . My delegation also wishes all the members of the Security Council a happy and prosperous new year for 2003 . The delegation of Rwanda welcomes this open debate on the sensitive issue of children and armed conflict . As a country emerging from genocide , Rwanda has a wide experience to share on this important topic of children and armed conflict . In Rwanda , children were killed by génocidaires , and survivors were traumatized by the violence , which left orphans in its wake . Rwanda believes that all children must go to school and that they must never again be involved in armed conflict . In the 1994 Rwanda genocide , children under 10 years old were used by génocidaires to hunt and to kill fellow children , adults and rape victims of the génocidaires . After the tragedy , children suspected of genocide were arrested , imprisoned in special prisons and re-educated . I would like to announce that this coming Friday , child suspects in prison will be released in accordance with the statement made by His Excellency President Paul Kagame of the Republic of Rwanda on the release of 40,000 suspects of genocide . Rwanda is totally committed to the protection of children and does not tolerate the abuse of children under any circumstances . The Rwandan delegation welcomes the report of the Secretary-General on children and armed conflict , document S / 2002 / 1299 . Rwanda hopes that action will be taken . We fully agree with the statement made by the Secretary-General in the Security Council this morning . We believe that sufficient funds must be spent on the education of children for development , instead of diverting financial resources to the destruction of human beings . Children are the hope of tomorrow ; that is why special attention should be given to our young children . Let us lead children to school and not to armed conflict . Let us take them school and ensure that there is follow-up so that they acquire appropriate skills , knowledge , education and discipline as future leaders of the world . The recruitment of children in armed conflict must be halted at all costs as a matter of urgency . Children must be able to grow in an environment of peace , and should never be involved in any armed conflict . That is why the Rwandan delegation condemns armed groups which enlist children under 18 years of age . It is dangerous to indoctrinate children with the ideologies of hatred and genocide with the final objective using them in fighting useless wars without a cause . Why use children in conflicts ? As we know , children naturally obey orders , even negative ones , such as the order to kill innocent people . Children will carry out any order in good faith because they do not differentiate between evil and the best things . The irrational warlords must understand why young children should not be brainwashed and become hostages of conflict . It is totally unacceptable to abuse children , and the Security Council must take a firm decision to reverse the current situation prevailing in some States Members of the United Nations . We call upon the Security Council and the international community to condemn the armed groups of the former Rwandan Army ( ex-FAR ) forces and Interahamwe , the Parti pour la liberation du peuple hutu , the Front pour la défense de la démocratie , the Conseil national pour la défense de la démocratie , the Mai-Mai and others mentioned in the annex of the report of the Secretary-General as currently using child soldiers in the Great Lakes region . My statement would be incomplete if I did not condemn those who rape children – as well as those who rape adults . Rape is one of the weapons used in armed conflicts , and children committed rape and were raped during the Rwanda genocide of 1994 . According to Rwandese law covering acts of genocide , adults who committed rape during the genocide are in the first category of génocidaires , who are given the death penalty . Infanticide must also be punished by the death penalty if we are to halt this crisis imposed on children . Let me emphasize that young children are the potential resources that can lift this world out of poverty and injustice and attain irreversible progress in accordance with the United Nations objective of achieving sustainable development . Children must therefore be freed from disease , hunger , slavery , corruption and conflict of all types . They must grow in an environment of love , peace and justice , with a thirst for appropriate knowledge and the skills to develop themselves . The whole world would thus harvest the fruits of such well-guided children . Those who are today involved in armed conflict must be demobilized without delay , and the United Nations Children's Fund ( UNICEF ) must put in place strategies and procedures and must provide the means for their implementation . Let the Security Council join hands with UNICEF as the saviour of the children of States Members of the United Nations . Investing in the education of young souls is the priority of priorities . The authorities of the Republic of Rwanda are grateful to Ms. Carol Bellamy , Executive Director of UNICEF , and to Mr. Olara Otunnu , Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Children and Armed Conflict , for their assistance to Rwanda orphans and to the many children who after the genocide prematurely became leaders of families of other children . Rwanda has a clear vision : to invest in those children in order to achieve irreversible development . Finally , Rwanda requests and recommends that the President of the Security Council declare a universal ceasefire in favour of children in order to withdraw them from armed conflicts . This is not a favour , but a fundamental right for children who are caught up in armed conflict and who are held hostage in some areas of conflict . They must be handed over to UNICEF . Even liberation movements must transfer children to liberated areas or demilitarized zones . In the case of displaced persons , Governments , non-governmental organizations , the Red Cross and United Nations agencies must attach special importance to the welfare of children by providing them with appropriate feeding , vaccination , medicines and schooling . Demobilized children must go back to formal schooling and should be motivated by UNICEF , the United Nations Development Programme and international financial institutions . Failure to save the lives of children condemns the whole world to misery and long-term social injustice . The President ( spoke in French ) : The next speaker inscribed on my list is the representative of Ukraine . I invite him to take a seat at the Council table and to make his statement . Mr. Kuchinsky ( Ukraine ) : I would like to begin , Sir , by expressing appreciation for the manner in which you are presiding over the work of the Security Council and by taking this opportunity to welcome you as the Permanent Representative of France . I am confident that your profound experience and excellent diplomatic skills will contribute greatly to the Council's activities and to the United Nations as a whole . Let me also thank you and the delegation of France for convening this important meeting . Ukraine believes that the practice of holding Security Council open debates on children and armed conflict is a clear manifestation of the great significance of this issue . Security Council resolutions 1261 ( 1999 ) , 1314 ( 2000 ) and 1379 ( 2001 ) became a strong basis for advocacy on behalf of war-affected children . Various references to this issue have been made in a large number of other Security Council resolutions , presidential statements , briefings and open debates . All this testifies to the Council's involvement in this important matter and to the fact that the protection of children is a priority concern in the area of peace and security . We are pleased with the considerable progress made lately in the field of protection of children affected by armed conflict . The entry into force of two international instruments – the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the involvement of children in armed conflict and the Rome Statue of the International Criminal Court ( ICC ) – which qualify crimes against children as war crimes , has become a milestone in strengthening and developing worldwide standards for the protection of children . I would like to express appreciation to the Secretary-General for his report on this issue ( S / 2002 / 1299 ) . For the first time , the report contains a list of parties to conflicts that continue to recruit and use children . Some 300,000 boys and girls are currently being exploited as child soldiers around the world . In our view , the publication of this list is yet another important step forward in our efforts to put an end to the impunity of those who disregard the rights of war-affected children . But it may not be enough just to condemn or prohibit the recruitment of children . We need to ask ourselves : why do children join armies ? If we are to prevent children from participating in the fighting , we need to understand specifically the causes that force children to become soldiers . Ukraine welcomes the efforts of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Children and Armed Conflict , Mr. Otunnu , and his Office aimed at creating , in cooperation with the Secretariat and the United Nations Children's Fund ( UNICEF ) , guidelines for United Nations peacekeeping personnel to ensure that children's rights and needs are given proper attention and response during the peacemaking process . Peacekeeping missions have a crucial role to play in providing protection to children . In order to implement this particular dimension of their mandate , a child protection adviser should be responsible for coordinating activities to ensure the protection and welfare of children . We are especially appreciative of the fact that the first advisers of this kind have already been deployed in Sierra Leone , the Democratic Republic of the Congo and , recently , in Angola . Despite the progress achieved so far , much remains to be done to ensure the effective protection and rehabilitation of children in times of war . We should not forget the alarming fact that during the last decade of the past century the world lost some 2 million of its youngest lives as a direct result of armed conflicts . Another 6 million were injured , and over more than 10 million were traumatized . Today , more than 20 million children have been displaced within or outside their countries due to war . Every month , nearly 800 children are killed or crippled by landmines . There is no doubt that the effective monitoring of adherence to the provisions of international law and the consequent obligations , as well as to the commitments pledged by parties to conflict , are essential actions for ensuring the protection of children and their rights . In that regard , it is important to continue to include observations concerning the protection of children in reports to the Security Council on specific conflict situations . When designing peacekeeping operations , the Security Council , in our view , should make every effort to protect both children and their supportive environment : schools , hospitals , health centres and religious institutions . Ukraine strongly endorses the concept of children and their protective and nurturing institutions being considered as zones of peace . It is important also to focus on children in post-conflict reconciliation programmes . There is an urgent need for the international community to support programmes , including advocacy and social services , for the demobilization of child soldiers and their reintegration into the community . Such children should be offered new experiences that will change their identity from that of soldiers . Education and training remain fundamental to that end . In our view , more attention should also be given to greater involvement by women in peacekeeping missions . We believe that that would help to enhance the capacity of missions in terms of protecting girl children and dealing with gender-sensitive aspects . Finally , I wish to stress that the Secretary-General's report sets out an important agenda and a basis for future work by the Council and by other United Nations bodies . Ukraine looks forward to further progress in that direction and is prepared to contribute specifically to the subsequent consideration of the issue of children and armed conflict . The President ( spoke in French ) : The next speaker inscribed on my list is the representative of Egypt . I invite him to take a seat at the Council table and to make his statement . Mr. Atta ( Egypt ) ( spoke in Arabic ) : At the outset , on behalf of the Egyptian delegation , I should like to tell you , Sir , how grateful we are to your friendly country and to congratulate you on your assumption of the presidency of the Security Council for this month . We should also like to thank the Secretary-General , Mr. Kofi Annan , and his Special Representative , Mr. Olara Otunnu , for their tireless efforts and valuable contributions aimed at enhancing and protecting the rights of children in armed conflict , and we reaffirm our total support for those efforts . During the past two years , the Security Council has devoted considerable attention to children in armed conflict , playing its role in that sphere by taking decisions related to peace-building and peacekeeping operations and by asking the parties to conflict to respect international law , in particular with regard to the protection of children . That is commendable , and complements the General Assembly's primary responsibility for children's issues . In that connection , I should like to express our gratitude to Mr. Olara Otunnu for his efforts and to draw attention to the importance of his field visits to raise awareness , to promote and to strengthen the protection , rights and well-being of children affected by armed conflict . In his report ( S / 2002 / 1299 ) , the Secretary-General says that Mr. Otunnu's visits had helped in the assessment of the situation of children in armed conflict , in making specific recommendations and in heightening the international community's awareness of the problems faced by children . In that regard , we reiterate our demand that the Special Representative of the Secretary-General visit children living under Israeli occupation in the occupied Palestinian territories and prepare a report on effective measures to help protect those children in implementation of the relevant provisions of the outcome of the General Assembly's May 2002 special session on children , as cited by the Assembly on 18 December 2002 in its resolution 57 / 190 . Palestinian children are not only suffering from occupation , with its devastating psychological consequences ; they are also deprived of their fundamental rights , including the right to live in security in a stable family environment . Not only are their families deprived of shelter and work ; their lives are threatened if they ask for their legitimate fundamental rights . The suffering of Palestinian children does not stop there : they are deprived of a future , because they are given no tools to improve their future . Palestinian schools have been closed , and Palestinian children can not continue their studies because of the constraints that have been imposed on them . The Secretary-General has stated that the cordoning off of the territories , the curfews , the barriers and the checkpoints give rise to humanitarian problems , which result in the deterioration of education . The suffering of Palestinian children has exceeded all limits : unless the situation improves , there is no hope for the short-term future . Therefore , Egypt urges all countries to help Palestinian children by ensuring their humanitarian and other basic needs . We invite the Special Representative of the Secretary-General to undertake a field visit to the region in order to raise awareness of the situation on the ground and to enable the international community to adopt effective necessary measures aimed at relieving the suffering of Palestinian children and ensuring their protection . Egypt supports all national and international efforts in the area of protecting the rights of children and improving their situation . We are firmly convinced that the economic , social , political and cultural progress of any society depends on the overall physical , moral , mental and educational development of its children . Over the past decade , the international community has undertaken many commendable efforts and has made great achievements in that area . Despite the success of the World Summit on Children , held in 1990 , and the setting of ambitious goals to help children , the world still witnesses a number of factors that have had a negative impact on children , such as the economic effects of debt , illness and epidemics . Recent years have witnessed a prevalence of armed conflict , a lack of respect for international law – especially international humanitarian law – and various violations of the rights of civilians . Hence , the problem of children in armed conflict – despite efforts to prevent their recruitment and to ensure their demobilization and reunification with their families , their protection from systematic violence and their psychological reintegration into their homes and communities . The Secretary-General's innovation in his report – the list of parties to conflict that are violating children's rights – is a commendable initiative that should be studied with a view to taking the necessary actions to track down those who violate the rights of children and bring them to justice . Within the framework of our commitment to work with the international community on issues pertaining to children in armed conflict , we urge that children be enabled to live in security and stability . The President ( spoke in French ) : The next speaker inscribed on my list is the representative of Austria . I invite him to take a seat at the Council table and to make his statement . Mr. Pfanzelter ( Austria ) : I have the honour to speak in Austria's capacity as current Chair of the Human Security Network , an interregional group of countries that also comprises Canada , Chile , Greece , Ireland , Jordan , Mali , the Netherlands , Norway , Slovenia , Switzerland and Thailand , and South Africa as an observer . Ever since the creation of the Human Security Network , in 1999 , the issue of children affected by armed conflict has been of critical importance to our agenda . The Network and its individual members have witnessed the origin of several important initiatives , such as the Agenda for War-Affected Children , adopted at the Winnipeg Conference in September 2000 ; the holding of workshops on the issue of ending the use of child soldiers in Jordan ; and the programmes of the Centre for Children Traumatized by Armed Conflicts in South-Eastern Europe , in Ljubljana , Slovenia , to name but a few . Austria made children and armed conflict one of the top priorities during its period in the chairmanship of the Network . At its next ministerial meeting in May this year in Graz , the Human Security Network is expected to adopt a common support strategy for children affected by armed conflict , identifying a set of operative principles as well as a training curriculum for child-rights monitors and rehabilitation experts . One of the results envisaged is that the Network will contribute to establishing a pool of child experts for eventual use in conflict areas . In November 2002 , the Human Security Network supported the holding here in New York of an international symposium on children affected by armed conflict . The event was organized by the Harvard Program on Humanitarian Policy and Conflict Research , in cooperation with the Coalition to Stop the Use of Child Soldiers , the Watchlist on Children and Armed Conflict , the United Nations Children's Fund and the Office of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General . The symposium focused on the implementation of Security Council resolution 1379 ( 2001 ) and came up with a set of concrete recommendations , which have been communicated to the members of the Council . Let me now touch upon the politically significant report of the Secretary-General before us . We strongly support the general thrust of this report and I would like to highlight a few of its aspects . It is indeed astonishing how the normative framework for the protection of children in armed conflict has been strengthened during the recent past . In less than a month , we will celebrate the first anniversary of the entry into force of the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on children in armed conflict . While progress with regard to the normative framework for the protection of children in armed conflict is certainly remarkable , I would like to reinforce the call made by the Secretary-General and his Special Representative to focus now on application . There is an essential role for the United Nations system in ensuring better implementation of the relevant standards , in the first place through an enhanced operationalization of activities in the field . Austria and the Office of the Special Representative are currently working together on a compendium containing all relevant international standards , which will be published shortly and is supposed to improve the understanding and knowledge of those dealing with children in armed conflict . Let me now come to the much anticipated list requested by Security Council resolution 1379 ( 2001 ) . The Human Security Network welcomes the list annexed to the report , as well as the description in the report of further situations of concern , which could not be added to the list due to formal reasons . This list is without doubt a major and politically significant contribution to raising awareness about the plight of children affected by armed conflict around the world and to eventually ending the recruitment of child soldiers . It also clearly demonstrates that the international community is no longer willing to close its eyes before one of the biggest tragedies we are facing today . While the annexed list candidly names 23 parties to armed conflict that recruit or use child soldiers and meet the other criteria set out in resolution 1379 ( 2001 ) , it is , however , obvious that it excludes large numbers of children equally affected by armed conflict . We therefore believe that the list needs to be extended . It should encompass all other situations where children are recruited or used as soldiers or where their protection needs are severely threatened in other ways . As an example , I would like to direct members' attention to one situation which is particularly alarming : the ongoing abduction of numerous boys and girls in northern Uganda . Based on reports from a variety of sources , we have reason to believe that large numbers of children are still being abducted and held by the Lord's Resistance Army for use in combat or as sex slaves . The Human Security Network is currently evaluating possible action to shed more light on this situation and to put a halt to this abominable practice . At the same time , we feel that it is necessary also for the Security Council to be able to better assess such situations . The Human Security Network has concrete recommendations to present to the Council which , in our view , would significantly increase the ability of this forum to address the issue of children and armed conflict and will have an impact on the lives of war-affected children . The 10 recommendations can be summarized as follows . We should continue the consideration of the issue of children and armed conflict on a regular basis and adopt new resolutions adding value to the debate . We should create an effective evaluation mechanism for the list of parties to conflict recruiting or using child soldiers and the relevant steps taken by those on it . This could include field visits . The involvement of international agencies and non-governmental organizations in this process is crucial . The Secretary-General should be requested to regularly update this list and consider extending it by also including conflict situations not on the Council's agenda , as well as other severe violations of relevant child-protection obligations , such as abductions or the use of landmines . We should enter into a dialogue with the Governments of countries on the list , ask them to report on the respective situations and urge them to put an immediate end to the recruitment or use of child soldiers , to reintegrate them into society and to stop all other severe violations of child-protection obligations . We must also raise awareness among all parties concerned , including non-State actors , of their obligations and responsibilities under international humanitarian , human rights , refugee and criminal law . We should ensure that the issue of children affected by armed conflict is also taken up under other agenda items of the Council , in particular when considering resolutions on specific conflict situations or when planning Security Council missions . According to a study by the Watchlist , only 9 out of 75 country-specific Security Council resolutions adopted between August 2000 and October 2002 included references to children and armed conflict . Attention must also be paid to the need for all peace processes ; all disarmament , demobilization and reintegration processes ; and all justice and reconciliation mechanisms to be child-conscious and for boys and girls to be fully involved in order to make sure that their voices are heard . The child-focused expertise in these processes should be increased and the training of peacekeeping , civilian police and humanitarian personnel on child protection standards promoted . Each peacekeeping operation should include at least one child protection expert . The establishment of rosters of qualified experts available should be encouraged . We should give higher priority to the issues of violence against , trafficking in and exploitation of children , in particular girls , and to the prevention of infectious and sexually transmitted diseases and HIV / AIDS , and request the provision of adequate assistance to the children affected . The Human Security Network also suggests that efforts be made to ensure safe and unhindered access to humanitarian assistance for children in emergencies , with emphasis on particularly vulnerable groups such as displaced and separated children . Finally , the Network suggests improving the exchange of information with non-members , international agencies and NGOs on the issue of children affected by armed conflict and the establishment a focal point for that purpose . In conclusion , let me assure the Council that the members of the Human Security Network remain fully committed to enhancing the protection of children in armed conflict . This is indeed an urgent matter pertaining to our common values and our conscience as human beings . The President ( spoke in French ) : I would like to inform the Council that there are 17 speakers remaining on my list . I intend , with the cooperation of the participants , to exhaust the entire list this afternoon . The next speaker is the representative of Nepal . I invite him to take a seat at the Council table and to make his statement . Mr. Sharma ( Nepal ) : I wish to begin by extending to you , Mr. President , and the other members of the Security Council warm , although belated , wishes for a happy new year . Let me also say how delighted my delegation is to see you so ably presiding over the Council . Children , the weakest sector of a population , suffer in many ways in situations of armed conflict . They lose their parents and other loved ones . They lose their homes and livelihoods . They lose basic services such as education and health . And they even lose their lives . Those who survive are often forced to live in camps and or in confinement as refugees or displaced persons and become susceptible to exploitation and temptations . The most horrendous crime that the parties to a deadly conflict commit is to use child soldiers . This robs children of their childhood and innocence and places them in a world of murder and mayhem . Traumatized and stigmatized , such children have difficulty coping with normal life and blossoming to their full potential . We have internationally agreed safeguards for the protection of children , but they remain ineffective in delivering results . The Convention on the Rights of the Child and its relevant Optional Protocol , Additional Protocol II to the Geneva Conventions and Convention No. 182 of the International Labour Organization ( ILO ) set basic international standards for the protection of children . They are complemented by a number of other compacts , conventions and resolutions . The International Criminal Court is certainly another potent instrument to protect children in armed conflict . Despite those provisions , children continue to face misery , exploitation and death in conflicts . The world community faces a daunting challenge : to stringently enforce those provisions . Part of the problem is due to the fact that world community has been incoherent in its response to conflict . Political considerations get in the way of devising a cogent and seamless set of actions . More often than not , funding has failed international compacts , whose vision loses focus along the trail of implementation . Critical is the imperative to ensure that the perpetrators of violence against children do not go unpunished . Crimes against children should not only be excluded from amnesty ; they should also carry heavier punishments . Special measures , including punishment , are essential to protect girl children . The nature of , and potential damage from , a conflict should determine the priority and extent of the international community's response . Clearing landmines should be undertaken with a sense of urgency , and should receive adequate funding . Resolute political will must be demonstrated to ensure effective control of small arms , which maim and kill most children . Collective efforts should be strengthened to prevent fuelling conflicts with proceeds from the exploitation of natural resources , drug trafficking and other criminal activities . Juvenile justice should constitute an important part of domestic courts and of international tribunals and courts to try child soldiers who might have committed grave crimes . A comprehensive programme should be put in place to demobilize child soldiers , as well as to give them skills and to rehabilitate them and reintegrate them into their communities . While a tailor-made response is essential to resolve disputes and prevent conflicts , we must also look at the larger picture and remove the causes or aggravating factors of conflicts . This calls for eradicating poverty and promoting sustainable development , as well as advancing justice and human rights around the world . In 9 out of 10 cases , non-State actors have been committing the horrendous crime of recruiting and deploying children as combatants with impunity . Changing the culture of impunity demands a fresh outlook as well as strengthened mechanisms and measures from the world community . Let me share a glaring example from my own country . As the Secretary-General has mentioned in the report before the Council ( S / 2002 / 1299 ) , children are being subjected to forced and involuntary recruitment by the Communist Party of Nepal ( Maoist ) . Indeed the Maoists , who are seeking to remove the constitutional monarchy and who are undermining democratic values and institutions , have turned children into sacrificial lambs in their brutal pursuit of political power . Yesterday , the Maoists reportedly abducted 80 children from a school . The other day they took 150 children from school at gunpoint . These children are forced to undergo combat training . They are often used as human shields in attacks . This is something the rebels have been doing on a regular basis . Young girls have become the principal targets of abduction by the Maoists , who are reportedly striving to induct more women into their guerrilla force . Families that do not consent to giving their children away face the direst consequences . This terror has set back the clock of progress in Nepal , a least developed country that was taking determined steps towards modernization . The Maoists are destroying schools and health posts , bridges and communication towers . They have also been killing teachers and political workers . Consequently , children are deprived of education and health services . The movement of people and trade have been impaired and tourism has dwindled . Villages have lost young men and women , as they flee their homes to escape Maoist atrocities and conscription . Development activities in rural areas have ground to a halt . Nepal has been trying its best to find a peaceful settlement to the problem . Only recently , His Majesty the King has appealed to all political forces to find a peaceful solution to the country's political problems and to engage the country's resources and energy in promoting development and prosperity for the common people . The Prime Minister has also called on the Maoists to come to the negotiating table and has promised to create the necessary environment for talks to begin . Given their trail of deception , their attitude towards negotiation – treating it as a tactical step to destroy the enemy rather than as a strategic framework for a peaceful resolution of conflict – and their confusing and often contradictory statements , the Maoists are yet to emerge as a credible partner for peace . Still , the Government is willing and eager to talk to stop the wanton bloodletting so that the nation can pursue the path of peace and progress with total dedication and commitment . Nepal is committed to protecting children in armed conflict . We have no child soldiers in our security forces . But we are profoundly distressed by the fact that the Maoists have been abusing our children , stifling their development and darkening their future . While bringing Maoists to justice for their crimes remains our obligation , we have instituted a programme to rehabilitate and reintegrate children who have escaped the Maoist trap . We will need the international community's financial and technical support in our endeavour . Central to that is the United Nations , whose remarkable work we commend . Our appreciation goes to the front-line agencies of the United Nations , including the United Nations Children's Fund , the United Nations Development Programme and others , for their work to protect children and promote their interests . We urge the Security Council to remain seized of situations under its consideration and to remain vigilant about others so that international peace and security are not jeopardized . The President ( spoke in French ) : I thank the Representative of Nepal for the kind words he addressed to my delegation . The next speaker inscribed on my list is the representative of Israel . I invite him to take a seat at the Council table and to make his statement . Mr. Mekel ( Israel ) : At the outset , I would like to extend my congratulations to you , Sir , on your assumption of the presidency for the month of January . Since this is my first statement before the Council , allow me to say that I look forward to a productive working relationship with you and with all the other members of the Council . Israel is pleased to be participating once again in the debate on this item . Of the wide range of issues on the Council's agenda , those affecting the well-being of children are among the most heartbreaking . The images , reports and statistics documenting the plight of children in areas of armed conflict paint a truly horrific picture . And it is precisely that horror that compels us to take action . The most recent report of the Secretary-General on children and armed conflict ( S / 2002 / 1299 ) contains a review of the progress made in implementing Security Council resolutions and other international instruments , as well as recommendations and observations aimed at achieving more widespread conformity with international norms . We welcome the report's general focus on the horrific practice of using children as soldiers . Children should be kept safe in school , not in harm's way on the battlefield . Instead , too many children are recruited to fight as soldiers in wars they did not start and are forced to give up their childhoods and often their lives in the perpetuation of destructive conflicts . These offences have long disturbed our moral sensibilities . Israel totally rejects the practice of using children as soldiers . We remain committed to eradicating this horrific practice and to improving more generally the situation of all children affected by armed conflict . Israel also supports efforts to increase awareness of the effects of armed conflict on children and to take children into greater consideration when addressing related issues , including terrorism and peacekeeping operations . Israel further welcomes the report's specific focus on those parties to an armed conflict that have failed to live up to their obligations by recruiting or using child soldiers . Our ability to make genuine progress will depend not only on focusing on areas in which progress has been made but also on areas in which it has not . Obviously , the formal practice of the forced conscription of children is abhorrent and must be outlawed and condemned . But the participation of children in conflict is not limited to formal military service . Children have also been recruited for roving militias , armed gangs and terrorist groups . In our region , children have been recruited and used by terrorist organizations as human shields , for the placing of explosives , as gunmen and even as suicide bombers , and it is regrettable that the Secretary-General's report does not mention this reprehensible tactic . Moreover , children have been educated to revere and emulate fighters and terrorists . In our region , we are faced with the disturbing phenomenon of children's television programmes that encourage youngsters to abandon their studies and sacrifice their lives in acts of war and terrorism . The subtler but no less repugnant indoctrination of children to hatred and violence , through official media , educational and religious institutions and other means , must also be the focus of widespread condemnation . Hatred and violence are learned behaviours . No child is born wanting to hate or kill . If we are ever to achieve the state of global peace that is the central objective of the Organization , we must ensure that we are educating the next generation in the values of tolerance , coexistence and non-violence . In our region , children have suffered terribly from decades of conflict and from the constant threat of terrorism . The Middle East has endured more than its share of wars that have left scars on all people in the region , but particularly on children . Israel has therefore supported international initiatives aimed at protecting children from the devastation of armed conflict , including the landmark Convention on the Rights of the Child , as well as the Convention's Optional Protocols , to which we became a signatory last year . Israel's accession to the Convention was followed by the adoption of its Basic Law : Human Dignity and Liberty , a law that ensured that rights of the child were guaranteed constitutional protection . The adoption of that law sparked a flurry of judicial and legislative activity that broadened and extended Israeli society's commitment to the principles of the Convention . Unfortunately , broad commitment to those principles , while reflected in the rhetoric of many delegations , is too often not matched in practice . There remain delegations that are quick to unite under the banner of protecting children from armed conflict , but whose actions betray their true political motives . Those delegations are far too willing to sacrifice genuine progress on these issues in favour of their political agenda . In its most recent session , the General Assembly adopted a resolution pertaining specifically to the situation facing Palestinian children . With the adoption of that resolution , the Assembly has brought to three the number of resolutions on the human rights of children : one regarding the rights of the child , one regarding girls and one regarding Palestinian children . The latter is the only resolution adopted with respect to one specific group of children . There is , for instance , no resolution adopted concerning the five specific problematic areas cited by the Secretary-General in his report . While Palestinian children are undoubtedly deserving of protection , one may ask whether the 106 Israeli children killed and the many Israeli children wounded by terrorism since September 2000 , or the children in Africa or in parts of the Arab world are any less deserving . Notwithstanding the questionable wisdom of adopting particularized resolutions on issues of universal concern , it is a grave shame that those who supported that one-sided resolution were unable to rise above narrow their political agenda and call for the protection of both Israeli and Palestinian children alike . We would urge responsible Member States not to indulge in such politicization of the work of the United Nations , especially with respect to an issue as important and urgent as our children . When we allow the issue of human rights to be used as a political weapon we cast doubt on our very commitment to human rights and we damage the credibility of this institution and its ability to work effectively on issues of common concern . Israel yearns for the day when peace is the prevailing global condition , and when there is no longer any need to deal with the specific impact of armed conflict on children . But until that day , the international community must continue to act with resolve in extending protection to those who are most vulnerable . Israel is a full partner in this endeavour and will act through all means to ensure that all the world's children enjoy their fundamental right to grow up free from fear , free from suffering and free from the horrors of war and terrorism . The President ( spoke in French ) : The next speaker is the representative of Ethiopia . I invite him to take a seat at the Council table and to make his statement . Mr. Hussein ( Ethiopia ) : At the outset , Sir , let me congratulate you and your delegation on your assumption of the presidency of the Council . My congratulations go also to the new non-permanent members : Angola , Chile , Germany , Pakistan and Spain . Ethiopia is grateful for this opportunity to address the Council on the issue of children and armed conflict . My delegation would also like to thank the Secretary-General for his report on children and armed conflict ( S / 2002 / 1299 ) as well as for his brief but important presentation this morning . I also join previous speakers in thanking Mr. Olara Otunnu and Ms. Carol Bellamy for the excellent presentations they made and for pointing out important issues we need to follow up on . I know that time is short and that there are many other speakers on the list , so I shall cite only some of the points I was going to make ; copies of my full statement have been made available . Today's debate is the fifth open debate the Security Council has devoted to the protection of children in armed conflict . That indicates that it is very serious about this issue and gives it the importance that it deserves . We also welcome the continued efforts of the Secretary-General to put the protection of children in armed conflict on the peace and security agenda of the United Nations ; in that respect we strongly support his recommendation to integrate child protection in peacemaking , peacekeeping and peace-building operations of the United Nations . There are many who are involved in the work of making the lives of children more agreeable in all its aspects . But I will cite only two : the Office of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Children and Armed Conflict and the United Nations Children's Fund . I commend them for their work and for their activities on behalf of children . One can list many things ; one can say many things . I think what needs to be said has been said by the Secretary-General and by all those who spoke before me . But I will say that there are two areas implied in the title of what we are discussing today : "" Children and armed conflict "" . Under the first , we have to take all the actions needed to stop those who violate the rights and the sanctity of the lives of children and take action against them . Secondly , when we talk of armed conflict , we have to look at the root causes of such conflict all over the world . I would conclude by saying that if the Council and the international community took a fraction of the time and resources they are now spending on one particular area of the world and spent it on this issue of stopping those who are attacking children , abducting children and recruiting children , then I am sure within a short period , even before the end of this year , that problem would have been dealt with . The President ( spoke in French ) : I thank the representative of Ethiopia for the kind words addressed to my delegation . The next speaker is the representative of Costa Rica . I invite him to take a seat at the Council table and to make his statement . Mr. Stagno ( Costa Rica ) ( spoke in Spanish ) : Over the past four years the Security Council has been holding periodic open debates on the situation of children in armed conflict . Unfortunately , the debates have had little practical impact . Mr. Olara Otunnu , Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Children and Armed Conflict , has reminded us that today more than 300,000 children under the age of 18 are involved in more than 30 armed conflicts . Millions of children have been the innocent victims of war : they have been killed , have become refugees or have been displaced . Hundreds of thousands more have been orphaned or left defenceless as a result of armed conflict . To be sure , in the past few years some progress has been made at the legal level . We welcome the entry into force of the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the involvement of children in armed conflicts , which bans compulsory recruitment and participation in hostilities for those under the age of 18 . Unfortunately , the Protocol does not also prohibit voluntary recruitment of minors . We are also pleased at the entry into force of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court ( ICC ) , which classifies as a war crime the recruitment of children under the age of 15 . But much remains to be done , and all States should now accede to the Optional Protocol and the Rome Statute . We were pleased to see the inclusion in the Secretary-General's report of a list of parties to armed conflicts that recruit or use children as combatants , in violation of their international obligations under paragraph 16 of resolution 1379 ( 2001 ) . It is high time for the international community to shoulder its responsibilities vis-à-vis those who are committing such massive violations of the fundamental rights of children . The Security Council must act . The Council must now require of those entities and States on the list that they stop recruiting children and demobilize those already recruited . Where necessary , the Council should consider imposing sanctions on entities or Governments that use or recruit children in their armed forces . But we can not fail to note that we do not agree with the rather restrictive interpretation offered by the Secretary-General of the mandate contained in paragraph 16 of resolution 1379 ( 2001 ) . In particular , we would question the Secretariat's decision to include on the list only those situations currently on the Council's agenda . We believe that the Secretariat would have done better by the children of the world had it adopted a broader approach to its mandate . We would like , therefore , to invite members of the Security Council to give detailed consideration to a parallel report that was prepared by a coalition of non-governmental organizations , the Coalition to Stop the Use of Child Soldiers . This parallel report includes a number of well-founded accusations against various governmental , paramilitary and revolutionary entities in 25 countries , as well as a list of specific recommendations to deal with each one of them . I would like , if I may , to mention a few of them . For example , on Afghanistan , the Coalition recommends that the Security Council monitor the new national army and existing factions so as to ensure that they are not recruiting children under the age of 18 . On Somalia , they also recommend to all parties that they adopt a policy of non-recruitment of children under the age of 18 . On Angola , Burundi , Guinea-Bissau and Sierra Leone , the Coalition recommends the implementation of specific programmes for the demobilization and reintegration of child soldiers as well as the creation of educational and employment opportunities in refugee camps , as an alternative to joining a rebel force . On Colombia , the Sudan , India and Indonesia , the Coalition recommends the inclusion of all revolutionary and paramilitary groups on the list prepared pursuant to paragraph 16 . On Myanmar , the Coalition believes that both Government and opposition forces should be included in the list . The Coalition recommends that the Government and opposition groups in Liberia should demobilize child soldiers . On Macedonia , Yugoslavia and Pakistan , it deems necessary further investigation to determine if opposition paramilitary groups are , in fact , recruiting children . On the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Nepal , the Coalition suggests , inter alia , the classification of the recruitment of children as a criminal offence . With respect to Palestine and the occupied territories , the Coalition calls on the various groups not to encourage children to participate in acts of violence . With respect to the Russian Federation , the Coalition is proposing that the Chechen rebel groups be included on the paragraph 16 list . On Rwanda and Uganda , the Coalition recommends the adoption of measures to implement the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child , including the carrying out of programmes for the demobilization and reintegration of child soldiers . Lastly , the Coalition recommends that the Secretary-General draw the attention of the Security Council to the situation in Sri Lanka . As can be seen from this list of recommendations , the Security Council is facing a tremendous task if an end is to be put to the use of child soldiers . Accordingly , we believe that the Council must adopt a holistic approach to protect young people . First , the Council should ensure that any resolution or measure adopted to deal with a specific situation of armed conflict must include clear and specific provisions aimed at safeguarding the security and fundamental rights of children during armed confrontation . Second , the Council should set up an institutional mechanism that would enable it to consider , on an ongoing and comprehensive basis , the problem of children in armed conflict . The Council should , accordingly , set up a subsidiary body to monitor the situation of children in all situations that are on the Council's agenda . To that end , it would make use of information provided by Member States and by non-governmental organizations . Following the model of the Counter-Terrorism Committee , the subsidiary body set up should have a group of independent experts who would evaluate objectively the information that is received . They could also carry out fact-finding missions where there are accusations of serious violations of the rights of the child , and they could offer early warning in the event of a situation that might threaten the security of children . Third , the Security Council , with assistance from the Secretary-General , should , on an ongoing basis , maintain , review and update the list of entities that recruit or use children in conflict , in violation of their international obligations . It is essential to broaden the list to include not just situations already on the Council's agenda , but also situations that , because of the seriousness of the violations of children's rights involved , should be referred to the Council by the Secretary-General . In this connection , the Council should request the Secretary-General to update the list regularly . Fourth , the Security Council should ensure that plans for the post-conflict demobilization , disarmament and reintegration of combatants must include programmes to facilitate the rehabilitation of child soldiers . Peace-building processes must take account of the perspective and the needs of children . Fifth , it is essential to take effective steps to regulate illicit trafficking in small arms and light weapons , which facilitate the use of children as combatants and are the main weapons used in the destruction wrought . We would advocate a complete prohibition on the transfer of weapons , ammunition and military assistance to Governments or armed groups that violate human rights , including the fundamental rights of children . Sixth , the Security Council , in any peacekeeping operation , must include humanitarian personnel who are dedicated to dealing with the problems of children who are victims of conflict . Such personnel should facilitate the provision of humanitarian assistance to children during conflicts . In this context , we are pleased that the Security Council has included in some peacekeeping operations expert advisers on the protection of children . Seventh , before adopting any sanctions regime , the Security Council should carry out an in-depth study of any possible impact on the most vulnerable population , particularly children . Any sanctions regime must include exceptions so as to minimize any damaging impact on children . We deem it essential that the Secretary-General make full use of his powers under Article 99 of the Charter and refer to the Security Council any situations of armed conflict in which young people under the age of 18 are being recruited or used in fighting . Over the long term , the only way to save children from evil consequences of armed conflict is to do away with war . As long as war exists , we can not free children from those harmful consequences . As long as there are wars , children will be orphaned , displaced , hurt or killed . As long as there are wars , schools and hospitals will be burned down , roads destroyed and families broken apart . As long as there are wars , it will be impossible to ensure that children can fully develop into worthy , productive and creative adults . The President ( spoke in French ) : The next speaker on my list is the representative of Indonesia . I invite him to take a seat at the Council table and to make his statement . Mr. Hidayat ( Indonesia ) : My delegation would like to congratulate you , Sir , on your assumption of the presidency of the Council for the month of January and to extend to you its sincere appreciation for organizing this open meeting on one of our key concerns , children and armed conflict . In our view , this meeting is an indication of the Council's continued commitment to the welfare of children in general and of its determination to ensure their protection . At this juncture , I would also like to express my delegation's gratitude to the Secretary-General for his report ( S / 2002 / 1299 ) , and to his Special Representative for Children and Armed Conflict for his efforts on this issue . Particularly worthy of notice in the current report are the commitments obtained for the protection and well-being of children in conflict and post-conflict situations . Indonesia continues to be concerned about the continued use of children in armed conflict around the world . In this regard , we take particular notice of the list annexed to the report , as requested by the Council in its resolution 1379 ( 2001 ) , of parties to armed conflict that recruit or use children in violation of their international legal obligations . We are disturbed at the abuses that children suffer in camps , and at the general suffering and deprivation that they endure because of conflicts . In that connection , it is also important to point out the persisting problem of humanitarian access in conflict situations . In the occupied Palestinian territories , for example , the Secretary-General reports that the conditions imposed by Israel – notably stricter closures , curfews , roadblocks and checkpoints – have created humanitarian problems including frequent school closures and a drop in immunization levels . This kind of avoidable inhumanity to society , especially to children , must not be allowed to continue . In the past , we have lent our national support to international efforts at ensuring the protection of children in such conflicts and at alleviating the suffering of those who have been unfortunate enough to find themselves in the midst of them . My delegation has always seen these two aspects of the problem : on the one hand , children are deployed as instruments in a situation while , on the other , they are intended and unintended victims . Children who are involved in battle , whether they are hurt or not , are victims , and there is not much of an escape once the bullets , or the logistical demands of conflict , take over . It is the responsibility of those formulating international law within the multilateral system to continue to adopt measures to limit children's involvement in and exposure to conflict . The continued recruitment of under-age children for the purposes of conflict should not continue with impunity . To respond to these concerns , the international community possesses several international instruments , such as the 1989 Convention on the Rights of the Child , of which Indonesia is a signatory . That Convention underlines the political , social , economic and civil rights of children . Indonesia also supports the Optional Protocol that strengthens the Convention by calling for a minimum age of 18 for eligibility for participation in hostilities . Unfortunately , in recent conflicts the Convention and its Optional Protocol have conveniently been ignored . In this connection , another key international document by which the international community has tried to address this issue in recent times is "" A world fit for children "" ( General Assembly resolution S-27 / 2 , annex ) , the outcome document of the landmark May 2002 special session of the General Assembly on children . It calls on the world community to make the world safer for children , and outlines the responsibilities of nations and the measures they must take in that regard . Among other things , it specifies an assortment of responses to protect children from armed conflict and impunity . We are of the opinion that it is a thorough and strong document that , if implemented , would go a long way towards resolving several issues relating to the protection of children in conflict situations . With reference to post-conflict situations , it is important to take a brief look at the example of what the United Nations Children's Fund ( UNICEF ) has been able to achieve in Sierra Leone . In 2001 , UNICEF helped more than 3,600 child soldiers in Sierra Leone to leave army life and rejoin their families . The children obtained counselling , vocational training and education towards reintegration into their communities . We commend and support programmes of this nature , not only those of UNICEF and other relevant United Nations agencies , in conflict and post-conflict situations where children have been a factor . Similarly , my delegation stresses the importance of enhancing the monitoring mechanisms spelled out in resolution 1379 ( 2001 ) . Since the adoption of that resolution , we are pleased that the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the involvement of children in armed conflict , and other relevant international agreements and conventions have entered into force . We can not afford to pay only lip service to this very important matter , and must therefore find ways of implementing these critical international instruments . To that end , we congratulate those States that are already making efforts to harmonize their national legislation with available international child rights standards . As we have often said , the future of humanity depends on children , and they must be protected because that is the only protection that the future of mankind has . We can not have our children exposed to violence so early in their lives without expecting them to bear and carry insecurity , violence and hatred within them , especially when they have also forfeited their youth and the chance of a good education at such an early stage of their lives . While conflict itself should be avoided altogether , children should not be dragged into it if it does arise . A child should not have to carry a gun , find himself at the receiving end of gunfire or be hurt by conflict . Rather than celebrate minor moral victories , the international community should focus its attention and evaluation on the larger picture . The President ( spoke in French ) : I thank the representative of Indonesia for the kind words he addressed to me . The next speaker on my list is the representative of Sierra Leone . I invite him to take a seat at the Council table and to make his statement . Mr. Rowe ( Sierra Leone ) : Mr. President , my delegation would like to associate itself with the words of welcome and congratulation extended to you by previous speakers . We look forward to working with you in your capacity as the President of the Security Council and as the new Permanent Representative of France . Sierra Leone has no more child soldiers . We say this not with a feeling of pride . We have no reason to take pride in the fact that Sierra Leone is not named in the Secretary-General's latest report ( S / 2002 / 1299 ) among areas of conflict where children are still being recruited and / or used as child soldiers . On the contrary , we say Sierra Leone has no more child soldiers only with a sense of relief ; relief that our children , those who survived the atrocious rebel war , are free at last from the abominable practice of recruiting children to kill and be killed . As a country that has just emerged from a prolonged and brutal armed conflict in which children were both perpetrators and victims , we know from experience the immediate and long-term consequences of the abduction , drugging , training and deployment of children for armed combat . Experience has also taught us that urgent action must be taken to put an end to such practices , first and foremost through the disarmament , demobilization and reintegration of ex-combatants . In 1999 the Government of Sierra Leone insisted that its peace agreement with the rebel movement the Revolutionary United Front ( RUF ) must include an appeal to the conscience of the parties to recognize that the children of Sierra Leone , especially those affected by the conflict , in view of their vulnerability , are entitled to special care and protection consistent with the provisions of the International Convention on the Rights of the Child . The Government , for its part , also pledged to accord particular attention to the issue of child soldiers by mobilizing resources through the Office of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Children and Armed Conflict , and through the United Nations Children's Fund ( UNICEF ) and other agencies , to address the special needs of these children in the disarmament , demobilization and reintegration ( DDR ) process . I would like to pay tribute to the Special Representative , Mr. Otunnu , and to Ms. Bellamy of UNICEF for their untiring efforts on behalf of the children of Sierra Leone . We would also like to commend them for their statements this morning . Sierra Leone has also learned from experience that the problem of former child soldiers could be addressed through the establishment of an oversight institution for the welfare of children in a post-conflict situation . Beyond the disarmament and demobilization process , however , we have tried to ensure that the welfare of children and the protection of their right to develop in a peaceful environment are at the centre of government policy-making and resource-allocation strategies . Our thanks again go to the Special Representative of the Secretary-General , Mr. Otunnu . His ground-breaking 15-point agenda for action for the children of Sierra Leone paved the way for the establishment in January last year of a statutory National Commission for War-Affected Children . It is now the principal child protection and advocacy mechanism in the country . Although the scope of its work is relatively wide and covers different categories of war-affected children , the Commission is expected to address the special needs of former child combatants . My delegation takes note of the reference in the Secretary-General's report to the risk we face in Sierra Leone of losing thousands of former child combatants to the conflict across the border in Liberia . This underscores our concern that in the absence of adequate resources for implementing the Government's reintegration programme for ex-combatants , especially the thousands of demobilized child ex-combatants , those warlords will take advantage of the situation and recruit them again into the killing circus that has characterized the activities of the rebel movements in the subregion . We therefore endorse wholeheartedly the recommendation that the Security Council and Member States should be urged to provide sustained and adequate resources to the relevant organizations engaged in implementing DDR programmes for children . My delegation strongly believes that the establishment of international norms proscribing the involvement of children in armed conflict , and strict compliance with those norms , are important steps in our collective effort to rid the world of this unconscionable practice . My delegation shares the view set out by the Secretary-General in his report that the codification of international norms and standards for the protection of children during conflict has made an impressive contribution to that effort . Sierra Leone has ratified the two Optional Protocols to the Convention on the Rights of the Child . We have also become a party to the African regional equivalent , the Organization of African Unity and African Union Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child . Our ratification of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court is also a testimony to our commitment to , among other things , the relevant provisions concerning the recruitment and use of child soldiers , and the mechanism of accountability for crimes specific to children . We also share the view of the Secretary-General that the challenge today is to ensure their implementation on the ground , that is , compliance with these international norms . The list of violators contained in his report is indeed an important step forward in our efforts , as he puts it , "" to induce compliance with international child protection obligations by parties to conflict "" ( S / 2002 / 1299 , para . 28 ) . However , my delegation believes – and we would like to stress this point here – that we must also recognize that rebels and other non-State insurgent groups are not parties to those international instruments on the involvement or use of children in armed conflict . As we witnessed in Sierra Leone , notwithstanding the commitments rebel movements make in peace agreements , these forces , at least in the West African subregion , account , in our view , for most of the recorded abuses of international norms for the protection of children in armed conflict . We recall here the number of instances where the RUF rebel movement reneged on peace and ceasefire agreements . We observe that there are only four Governments on the "" name and shame "" list annexed to the Secretary-General's latest report . That of course does not mean that we should downplay violations by States . The list indicates clearly , as far as we are concerned , that ways and means must be found for dealing more effectively with the role of non-State actors in the recruitment and use of child soldiers . This brings my delegation to a related issue that has been placed on the agenda of the Security Council : the illegal trade and transfer of small arms and light weapons . Many speakers referred to it this morning , and Switzerland and other delegations also spoke about it eloquently this afternoon . The Sierra Leone delegation would like to take this opportunity to reiterate once again its appeal to all States , in particular manufacturers and their agents , to ensure , including through appropriate legislation , that these weapons do not get into the hands of rebel movements and other non-State actors . Security Council arms embargoes and travel restrictions against rebel movements are very important – we recognize that – but are certainly not enough , especially where sanctions monitoring mechanisms do not exist or are woefully ineffective . Finally , based on the Sierra Leone experience , my delegation would like to see in the draft resolution to be adopted by the Security Council following its discussion of the Secretary-General's report some reference to the question of impunity . The Special Court for Sierra Leone should be seen as an example of the type of mechanism available to the international community for addressing impunity , especially impunity related to the recruitment of children to commit heinous atrocities in conflict situations . We feel that the Special Court could be regarded as a court set up for our children's sake . As the prosecutor , David Crane , said recently , the children of Sierra Leone have suffered enough both as victims and as perpetrators . The objective is to prosecute not children , but the people , including those warlords , who forced thousands of children to commit unspeakable crimes . The President ( spoke in French ) : I thank the representative of Sierra Leone for the kind words he addressed to my delegation . The next speaker is the representative of Slovenia . I invite him to take a seat tat the Council table and to make his statement . Mr. Kirn ( Slovenia ) : Slovenia has already associated itself with the statement made by the representative of Greece on behalf of the European Union and with the statement made by the representative of Austria as Chair of the Human Security Network , and we fully endorse both of them . Since the issue of children and armed conflict is one of particular importance for Slovenia , I would like to highlight some points in our national capacity . Let me first express our appreciation to you , Sir , for having convened this meeting . We consider it primarily to be an opportunity to review the progress achieved and to identify further action to be taken . Since the adoption of resolution 1261 ( 1999 ) , the issue of children and armed conflict has been firmly established on the agenda of the Security Council , in recognition of its importance for peace and security , thus adding a new dimension to the discussions in this body , which Slovenia firmly supports . We are pleased to see that a number of significant developments were achieved in the past year , particularly in the normative domain , such as the entry into force of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court . Slovenia ratified the Rome Statute in December 2001 , and we are looking forward to the constitution of the new Court in March this year . Almost a year ago , the Optional Protocol on the involvement of children in armed conflict entered into force , and it is encouraging to note the growing acceptance of this new instrument . Slovenia will ratify it in the very near future . The special session of the General Assembly on children , held last May , and the adoption of the outcome document , "" A world fit for children "" reaffirmed our joint commitment to protect children during armed conflict , in accordance with international humanitarian and human rights law . This provides the necessary political , as well as legal frameworks , to combat the abuse of children in armed conflict . We call on all Member States and all other parties in conflict to fully implement or respect their provisions , and especially to act against impunity for all crimes committed against children . Slovenia welcomes the most recent report of the Secretary-General on children and armed conflict . We would like to express our sincere appreciation of and support for Special Representative Olara Otunnu and his Office for their work in this respect . This is the first time that parties recruiting and using child soldiers have been specifically identified , giving us a clear picture of who the perpetrators of crimes against children really are . The report and the annex list represent a very clear sign that the international community is no longer ready to tolerate abuses of children in conflict situations . They also represent a concrete contribution to the raising of global awareness on this issue . Slovenia shares the views expressed that the report should be the first step towards drawing up an integral list of all parties using children , not only those involved in situations on the Security Council's agenda . Austria , on behalf of the Human Security Network , presented a set of specific recommendations to the Council on how to further address this issue , and Slovenia fully supports those recommendations . I should like just to recall the need to regularly update the list , to extend it by including situations that are not on the Security Council's agenda and to ensure that the issue of war-affected children is taken fully into account in all of its decisions on peacemaking , peacekeeping and peace-building operations . Another positive development this year is the beginning of the deployment of child protection advisers in some United Nations peace operations . We concur with the Secretary-General and his Special Representative that the deployment of such advisers in each United Nations peace operation is highly desirable . In addition to efforts undertaken globally , regional and interregional action is needed . We greatly appreciate the opportunity to share our views with the like-minded countries of the Human Security Network . As pointed out by Austria , the Network believes that it can significantly contribute to the global debate on the issue , as well as improve the situation in our respective regions through various concrete activities . Being aware of the importance of children for the future and for the prosperity of our societies , Slovenia decided several years ago to contribute to the recovery of South-Eastern Europe by establishing an institution to assist war-affected children – the Regional Centre for the Psychosocial Well-being of Children , which is also called "" Together "" . The basic aim of the Centre is to strengthen local structures in the field of child care , to develop mechanisms for their psycho-social protection and to empower war-affected children , remaining in the region even after international assistance has been withdrawn . We would like to thank all donors and to invite all other countries and institutions to work with us to improve the situation of war-affected children in South-Eastern Europe . Another of Slovenia's initiatives contributing to the safety of children in the region of South-Eastern Europe is in the area of anti-personnel mines and demining – the work conducted by the Slovenia-based International Trust Fund for Demining and Mine Victim Assistance . The report of the Secretary-General points out that little progress has been made regarding efforts to sever the link between the proliferation and widespread use of small arms and light weapons and the related victimization of children . In this regard , I am pleased to inform the Security Council that a United Nations subregional conference on the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons in all its aspects , co-organized by the United Nations and Slovenia , will be held in Slovenia in March this year . We hope that the conference will contribute to reducing the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons and its negative impact , including its impact on children , in the region of South-Eastern Europe . In conclusion , allow me to reassure you , Mr. President , that Slovenia fully supports all endeavours of the Office of the Special Representative , the United Nations Children's Fund and other United Nations agencies and non-governmental organizations in this field . We encourage continuous and meaningful dialogue and cooperation among all of us , with the aim of alleviating the plight of children affected by armed conflict . The President ( spoke in French ) : The next speaker inscribed on my list is the representative of Myanmar . I invite him to take a seat at the Council table and to make his statement . Mr. Swe ( Myanmar ) : In congratulating you , Sir , on your assumption of the presidency of the Council , I would also like to thank you for convening a public meeting on children and armed conflict . The situation of children in armed conflict is heart-wrenching . As the Secretary-General's report pointed out , war displaces families and communities , and children are at risk of exploitation and forcible recruitment . This underscores the fact that peace and stability are important , not only for the development of the country concerned but also for the welfare of its population , particularly women and children , which are the most vulnerable groups in conflict situations . As reflected in the Secretary-General's report , impressive gains have been made in codifying international norms and standards for the protection and well-being of children . We share the opinion that there is a need to promote and disseminate these norms and standards and to raise awareness about them on the ground . We take satisfaction from the fact that , in preparing the list , the Secretary-General was guided by resolution 1379 ( 2001 ) . We note , however , that the report departed from its mandate when it made reference , under situations of concern not included in the list , to a number of countries , including Myanmar . We particularly regret that in addition to the armed insurgent groups in Myanmar , the national armed forces were also referred to – this despite the fact that there is no credible evidence of the use and recruitment of children by the Myanmar Armed Forces . In that regard , I share the view expressed this morning by one Council member about the need for verification and checking the validity of information before it is presented to the Security Council . Nor should the issue of protection of children be politicized . The allegation made regarding my country is the result of interviewing 20 or so insurgents inside a neighbouring country . Additionally , the situation in Myanmar is not , by any stretch of the imagination , a threat to international peace and security . The Myanmar armed forces is an all-volunteer army . Those entering military service do so of their own free will . Under the Myanmar Defence Services Act of 1974 and War Office Council Instruction 13 / 73 , a person can not enlist in the armed forces until he has attained the age of 18 . There is neither a draft system nor forced conscription by the Government of Myanmar . The Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights , who had visited Myanmar four times , expressed concern in his report over : "" abuses of civilians and refugees on the part of armed opposition groups , notably the Karenni National Liberation Army , which has been accused of forced conscription of male villagers , including under-age youths "" . ( A / 57 / 290 , para . It is a practice of armed insurgent groups in Myanmar to recruit and abuse child soldiers . That was brought to the wide attention of the international community in 2000 , when some members of a splinter insurgent group , styling themselves as God's Army , took over a hospital in Ratchaburi , in Thailand , taking 700 people hostage . The self-styled God's Army is an insurgent group led by two 10-year-old twins , Johnny and Luther Htoo . We share the view of many delegations that the best way of protecting children in armed conflict lies in conflict prevention and resolution . Myanmar regained its independence in January 1948 . In a matter of months , it had to face the challenge of insurgencies by various armed groups . Until recently , there were 18 armed insurgent groups in the country , as well as a narco-trafficking armed group . For over 40 years , Myanmar had to suffer the scourge of insurgency . The ethnic insurgencies which had existed in Myanmar since its independence were contained and rolled back only in recent years through the painstaking efforts of the Government . As a result , 17 armed ethnic insurgent groups have participated in the exchange of arms for peace programme . They are now actively engaged in development activities in their respective regions , together with the Government . Apart from a splinter armed group of narco-traffickers , only one ethnic insurgent group , the Kayin National Union ( KNU ) , remains to return to the fold , and the Government continues to extend an olive branch to this group . For the first time in nearly half a century , the armed conflict that plagued Myanmar has ceased in all parts of the country with the exception of a few border areas . The Special Rapporteur on human rights , in commending the achievement of the ceasefire agreements by the Government with 17 armed ethnic groups , stated in his report : "" After decades of fear , insecurity and widespread violence the first dividend of the ceasefire agreements is peace and the second is some development "" ( ibid. , para . The Government is promoting a culture of peace . We are fully aware that , in any conflict situation , children are among the most vulnerable groups . We share the determination to give the fullest attention to the question of protection of children in armed conflict . The Secretary-General's report has pointed out that education has also been a casualty of war . In Myanmar , since civil insurgency has effectively been overcome in nearly all parts of the country , the Government has been able to concentrate its efforts on development of the areas where fighting raged for over four decades . In 1992 , the Government set up a separate ministry for that purpose and was able to bring development to those areas . It has built hospitals , roads and bridges in these border areas . From 1988-1989 to 1998-1999 , in a span of 10 years , it built more than 350 schools in the former insurgent-held areas . The Government has now been able to provide child immunization for all children nationwide . We are able to conduct extensive immunization programmes in the remote areas . It is a time-honoured tradition in Myanmar to place special emphasis on the overall development of children and to ensure their protection , upbringing and development . In bringing about peace and stability , we endeavour to provide the children with a peaceful and developed world so that they will have a secure and enabling environment to develop their individual capabilities . The President ( spoke in French ) : The next speaker inscribed on my list is the representative of Colombia . I invite him to take a seat at the Council table and to make his statement . Mr. Valdivieso ( Colombia ) ( spoke in Spanish ) : I am pleased , Sir , to see you representing France and presiding over this Security Council meeting devoted to an item that connects two important aspects of United Nations action in the world : the maintenance of international peace and the protection of children . My delegation is grateful for the presentations made at the beginning of the meeting by the Secretary-General , by his Special Representative for Children and Armed Conflict , Mr. Olara Otunnu , and by the Executive Director of the United Nations Children's Fund ( UNICEF ) , Ms. Carol Bellamy . We acknowledge the commitment of these latter two officials in ensuring that peacekeeping operations focus on the special needs of children in conflict situations . The needs of children are one aspect of the broad actions required to protect civilians in armed conflict . In this respect , I would like to recall that in the statement issued on 20 December 2002 on the protection of civilians in armed conflicts ( S / PRST / 2002 / 41 ) , the Council encouraged United Nations agencies to cooperate with Member States in formulating a comprehensive , coherent and action-oriented approach to the protection of civilians in armed conflict . The report of the Secretary-General ( S / 2002 / 1299 ) , which is the basis for this debate , highlighted several special needs of children in conflict situations . It referred , among other things , to juvenile justice , education on the risks of landmines , and care for internally displaced children and for girls who are exposed to sexual abuse . Therefore , we encourage Council members to bear those needs clearly in mind when considering conflicts that are included in their programme of work . The problem of child soldiers is so important that it has captured the attention of agencies , such as the World Bank , which in the past were quite remote from this topic . The report's list of military forces and rebel groups that recruit children alerts us to the need to resolve these conflicts and to counter the world trade in small arms and light weapons . We call on the Council to consider establishing the origin of arms that are used by groups that recruit minors , and we call , in particular , on arms-exporting countries , for greater controls . We regret the fact that many rebel groups within Colombia continue to recruit and kidnap children in order to carry out their attacks against society . The Government of Colombia , in accordance with its accession to international conventions – in particular to the relevant Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child – does not recruit those younger than 18 in its military forces . We encourage other States to accede to the Protocol and to respect this limit on compulsory recruitment and on the participation of minors in combat . As this is my last official function as representative of Colombia to the United Nations , I should like to thank you , Mr. President , for the opportunity to participate in this debate . I assure you that it will guide my personal action in this area in the coming years . In addition , I thank my colleagues of the countries members of the Security Council for the friendship and cooperation that they extended to me during Colombia's two years on the Council , which concluded just a few days ago . Moreover , I should like to wish the new members every success in their work on behalf of international peace . The President ( spoke in French ) : I should like to take this opportunity , on behalf of the members of the Security Council , to say that we regret the departure of the Permanent Representative of Colombia , to thank him for his very valuable contribution to the Council's work over the past two years , and warmly to wish him every success in his future endeavours . The next speaker inscribed on my list is the representative of Malawi . I invite him to take a seat at the Council table and to make his statement . Mr. Lamba ( Malawi ) : Let me begin by saying that I shall present what one might call a summary in the interests of time . Copies of my complete statement have been deposited with the conference officers . I should like to join preceding speakers in congratulating you , Sir , on assuming the presidency of this important organ of the United Nations and in thanking you and the Security Council for organizing this important debate to highlight the plight of children in conflict situations . My delegation would also like to congratulate the Secretary-General on his lucid and candid report on children and armed conflict ( S / 2002 / 1299 ) , which forms the substance of this debate . Special acknowledgement also goes to the excellent presentations by the Special Representative of the Secretary-General , Mr. Olara Otunnu , and by the Executive Director of the United Nations Children's Fund , Ms. Carol Bellamy . The information that has been provided will undoubtedly lead to soul-searching with regard to the strategies needed for the protection of children , especially in armed conflicts , but also for the necessary post-conflict care . My delegation is satisfied with the approach aimed at monitoring and reporting the treatment of children through the codification of international norms and standards to secure maximum protection . Malawi can not claim much experience in armed conflict , and the problem of children now under discussion might be considered rather peripheral on Malawi's socio-economic agenda . However , the welfare of children must form the central feature of any nation's socio-economic planning . Malawi has supported all actions designed to create an improved environment for our children's realization of their full physical , emotional and intellectual potential . All regional and international protocols for children have been accorded Malawi's support . Malawi considers imperative the promotion of any action that alleviates children's suffering and deprivation , which negatively affect their hope for a good future . Although Malawi may not be engaged in conflict or warfare , it – like many other African countries – is engaged in a more subtle war against the HIV / AIDS pandemic , which has created approximately 600,000 orphans , of whom no less than one fifth were born already infected with HIV and therefore face a bleak future in an environment blighted by excessive poverty . The Malawi Government has placed children high on its development agenda , and its vigorous intervention in child development – which covers nutrition , water and sanitation , psycho-social care , education and health – demonstrates its seriousness in addressing the welfare of children . Malawi ratified the Convention on the Rights of the Child in 1991 , and the Government is working in collaboration with the Committee on the Rights of the Child to assiduously monitor the implementation of the Convention . Other concrete measures taken by the Government include the establishment , in 1999 , of a children's rights unit within the Malawi Human Rights Commission to protect children from abuse , violence and exploitation . The Malawi Law Commission has embarked on a review of existing legislation to bring it into conformity with international human rights standards , including those for children . Financial and technical assistance will be needed here to promote the administration of juvenile justice and human rights education . Malawi is also a signatory to all International Labour Organization protocols , and national legislation has been enacted to regulate the minimum age of employment . The United Nations Children's Fund ( UNICEF ) has always proved to be an ardent partner in the improvement of the state of Malawi's children . Our achievements today must contribute to a positive and hopeful future for our children . That is why my delegation commends the Secretary-General's report for exposing and providing heightened awareness of the plight of children created by a senseless adult world . My delegation fully endorses all measures proposed and adopted for the creation of a world fit for children and all actions taken under international humanitarian and human rights law to induce compliance by the perpetrators of crimes against children . Therefore , my delegation hopes for systematic international compliance , on the part of both States parties and insurgent armed groups , with two instruments : the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the involvement of children in armed conflict and the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court . In the report , Malawi is pleased to note the United Nations offer of technical and legal assistance in the area of ensuring children's rights . In conflict regions , no child can be safe , whether that child is in the fighting ranks or in a devastated home environment . The trauma experienced by children in conflict remains with them long afterwards . Malawi therefore endorses the establishment of child protection advisers in affected countries , such as Angola , Sierra Leone and the Democratic Republic of Congo , to collaborate with other stakeholders , such as UNICEF and Governments . Indeed , children's rights must be highlighted on the United Nations agenda of peacemaking , peacekeeping and peace-building , with child protection adequately integrated into that agenda . It is our hope that the draft guidelines formulated by the Department of Peacekeeping Operations and the Department of Political Affairs will make an effective contribution to the promotion of effective child protection . The proposed comprehensive child protection training to supervise the conduct of staff towards children in mission areas stands out as a necessary initiative that deserves unqualified support . Equally important is the suggested inclusion of landmine risk education programmes and rehabilitation of child victims of mines . The exploitation of children as forced labour to extract natural resources in various countries , including the Democratic Republic of the Congo , only emphasizes the inhuman tragedy faced by displaced children . A childhood spent in refugee camps encounters enormous challenges . Indeed , apart from forced labour , the recruitment of children by armed forces and by other groups deprives them of the right to education , to proper health care , to development and , above all , to choices . A refugee camp in a foreign country creates an even more complicated situation for children . Malawi fully supports the work of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees , whose work and intervention brings hope to the many suffering children . The horrible experiences of girls and women in armed conflicts present a nemesis to any norms of civilization and form a topic deserving urgent action . The substantial claims of sexual exploitation involving rape , forced recruitment , abduction and trafficking all serve as condemning testimony to the absence of commitment to practical support for girls' welfare . On a different occasion in the United Nations , Malawi expressed total condemnation of the despicable sexual exploitation of girls in conflict zones not only by armed forces , but , more disturbingly , by aid workers and peacekeepers . Malawi notes with satisfaction the Plan of Action of the Inter-Agency Standing Committee's Task Force on Protection from Sexual Exploitation and Abuse in Humanitarian Crises , the strict implementation of which should make a significant difference and contribution towards the protection of girls from sexual exploitation . My delegation would like to pay special tribute to the Secretary-General for including in his report lists of people and States involved in the violation of the legal and human rights of children who find themselves subjected to various indignities and deprivation . The list should create a time for reflection over the important obligation of international child protection through unquestionable compliance with international agreements and protocols . Malawi will support any Security Council actions with respect to States and organizations listed in the report . Children's rights deserve respect and their flagrant violation with impunity should not be tolerated and must be addressed through recourse to punitive measures , such as tough sanctions . Finally , the field visits of the Special Representative have demonstrated the crucial importance of such an approach to verify and elucidate the war-affected child's situation in conflict zones . Such visits , which need to be encouraged , give the Special Representative a visual picture of the extent of the problem . The data so competently collected enriches our comprehension of the child's predicament . As the Security Council deliberates the problems facing the child in conflict areas , it is Malawi's strong plea that children facing other crises , such as HIV / AIDS , should feature in the Special Representative's future itinerary . For example , Malawi , where the pandemic has created untold misery for children , would benefit from a proactive visit by the Special Representative to assess the efficacy of the interventions and child-protection measures currently in place and subsequently to advise appropriately . My delegation would like to conclude this statement by once again thanking the Secretary-General for submitting a landmark report on children , which will challenge the deliberations of the Security Council . If the mishandled child , who holds the future , can not be considered a security issue , what can ? If we can not demonstrate concern for the child now , who will and when ? There is no time to stand idle and watch . The President ( spoke in French ) : The next speaker inscribed on my list is the representative of Liechtenstein . I invite him to take a seat at the Council table and to make his statement . Mr. Wenaweser ( Liechtenstein ) ( spoke in French ) : At the outset , I should like to thank you , Sir , for convening this meeting on a subject to which we attach the highest importance . ( spoke in English ) Liechtenstein welcomes action by the Security Council on the issue of children and armed conflict and , in particular , the open debates , the products of which have been instrumental in creating a normative framework for the protection of children affected by armed conflict . Much to our satisfaction , the special session on children last year also placed strong emphasis on this topic . As far as standard-setting is concerned , the year 2002 was a good one for children . Two new legal instruments entered into force : the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the sale of children , child prostitution and child pornography and the Optional Protocol on the involvement of children in armed conflict . Liechtenstein has signed both of these Protocols and is preparing to ratify them . Another step forward – an historic step indeed – was the entry into force of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court . The Statute , among other things , provides for the better protection of children , especially but not exclusively in times of armed conflict . The inclusion of the recruitment and use by all parties to a conflict of children under the age of 15 in conflicts of both an international and non-international character as a war crime is of special importance in this respect . Success in standard-setting must not give us cause for complacency – quite to the contrary . While the existing standards are high , the picture continues to be very grim when it comes to their application . The rights of millions of children around the world continue to be violated in numerous and brutal ways . Children affected by armed conflict , with all its manifold and devastating consequences , are in the worst situation . We therefore agree with the Special Representative on Children and Armed Conflict that we must move with resolve into an era of application , which was also one of the lessons we drew from last year's special session on children . In the implementation of these existing norms , the Security Council can play a central role . The creation of a list of parties to conflicts on the Council's agenda that continue to recruit or use child soldiers is one measure through which to make progress in assuring compliance with international obligations . The list should be expanded to cover parties to conflicts in a global manner , not only in situations on the agenda of the Council . We welcome such practical steps and hope that the Council will again agree on a strong response to the report before us and thus ensure a follow-up based on the recommendations contained in the report . We welcome the report before the Council and its emphasis on systematically integrating child protection objectives into the mandates of peace operations , including through the deployment of child protection advisers and special training for peacekeeping personnel . Given the importance of the participation of children in accordance with the letter and spirit of the Convention on the Rights of the Child , children must be given a voice , in particular in the process of post-conflict peace-building , rather than merely having their best interests represented by others . Liechtenstein has supported the work of the Special Representative , Mr. Olara Otunnu , right from the inception of his mandate . His advocacy on behalf of children in armed conflict over the past six years has been heard widely and proven effective . Worldwide awareness of children and the ways in which they are affected by armed conflict is increasing . In order to enhance the application of the legal instruments I referred to at the outset of my statement , more needs to be done to make these achievements better known . Advocacy and creating awareness help to broaden the base of support and to get more stakeholders involved . In this context , the work and involvement of non-governmental organizations and civil society groups can be instrumental , especially in highlighting different aspects of the plight of children affected by armed conflict . In this context , we have taken note with great interest of two reports : first , the "" 1379 Report "" of the Coalition to Stop the Use of Child Soldiers and , secondly , the study on the voices of girl child soldiers presented by the Quaker United Nations Office . The situation of the girl child is one aspect that requires our special attention in order to effectively protect the rights and well-being of children affected by armed conflicts . Those conflicts have manifold and complex consequences for all children , but specific forms of victimization are often added to the plight of girls and women . Rape , abduction , sexual enslavement and trafficking are some of the crimes perpetrated against female victims in particular . What is characteristic of such crimes is their traumatic nature and long-term effects . One figure may illustrate this point : two out of three women and girls raped during the 1994 genocide in Rwanda have reportedly tested positive for HIV / AIDS . It is therefore no exaggeration to say that the genocide continues in a silent way . True stability and security can not be re-established for long after an armed conflict has subsided , because of the specific crimes inflicted especially upon women and girls . All of that is to say that the international community would be well advised to address very specific issues and details regarding children affected by armed conflict . As I indicated at the outset , it does not suffice to adopt broad norms and standards . The effects of armed conflicts on children , the different forms of child labour and sexual exploitation and the resulting special vulnerability of children to the HIV / AIDS pandemic stand out as areas where concerted national and international action is a prerequisite for successful and durable solutions . All these issues constitute large-scale crises that can be addressed only through specific and coordinated action by all of us . Nobody must be allowed to deprive children of both their childhood and their future . By permitting this we would be violating a moral imperative we all hold dear . But , moreover , we would not only be destroying the future of individual children but also the collective future of the countries concerned . The President ( spoke in French ) : The next speaker inscribed on my list is the representative of the Democratic Republic of the Congo . I invite him to take a seat at the Council table and to make his statement . Mr. Ileka ( Democratic Republic of the Congo ) ( spoke in French ) : I have the pleasant duty of expressing my delegation's satisfaction at seeing the representative of France presiding over the Security Council as we begin the year . My country enjoys excellent relations with France , relations that are based on mutual trust and respect . Allow me also , Mr. President , to pay tribute to your predecessor , the representative of Colombia . I commend him for the skill and ability with which he discharged his difficult tasks during his presidency last month . I would like to congratulate Angola , Chile , Germany , Pakistan and Spain on becoming members of the Council . I would also like to pay well-deserved tribute to the outgoing members . We are very grateful to them for their efforts , in particular with regard to the search for peace in my country . Lastly , I would like to thank you , Mr. President , for having convened this meeting of the Security Council . I also express my gratitude for the Secretary-General's important report on children and armed conflict ( S / 2002 / 1299 ) , which Special Representative Olara Otunnu presented this morning with his usual eloquence . I also thank Ms. Carol Bellamy , Executive Director of the United Nations Children's Fund ( UNICEF ) , for her important statement . With regard to the item under consideration , I would like to remind the Council that problems pertaining to the protection of children are central to my Government's primary concerns . That concern is reflected , for example , in the existence of an institutional and legal framework to guarantee the rights of children . Despite the continuing financial difficulties and war , my Government has reacted positively to all the recommendations relating to the protection of children that are contained in the relevant resolutions of the Security Council , including resolution 1325 ( 2000 ) on the subject of women and peace and security . Furthermore , the Democratic Republic of the Congo is party to the major international instruments on the protection of the rights of the child , including the Convention on the Rights of the Child and its Optional Protocols on the involvement of children in armed conflict and on the sale of children , child prostitution and child pornography , the African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child , International Labour Organization ( ILO ) Convention No. 138 – concerning the minimum age for employment – and No. 182 – on the elimination of the worst forms of child labour , and , of course , the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court ( ICC ) . The implementation of the Rome Statute is of great importance to my Government , which expended great effort to facilitate its entry into force , which took place on 1 July 2002 . This treaty includes an important provision to protect the rights of children , making it a war crime to conscript children under the age of 15 years into national armed forces . The Council should also recall that my Government has been greatly involved in the process of protecting children , including through the promulgation of its Decree-Law No. 66 , of 9 June 2000 , which dealt with the demobilization and reintegration of vulnerable groups in armed forces . That political will has been reflected in the establishment of an appropriate structure , the National Bureau for Demobilization and Reintegration ( BUNADER ) , which is charged with following up and implementing the decree-law in partnership with UNICEF , whose valuable work is greatly appreciated . Since 1997 , my Government has been aware of the urgency of the need to end the presence of child soldiers known as kadogo in the Congolese armed forces . Since that time , my Government has developed several programmes to demobilize child soldiers . Most of those programmes required multilateral support , in particular through the United Nations Development Programme ( UNDP ) and the Human Rights Field Office in Kinshasa . Other programmes required bilateral assistance . While today we welcome the sincere cooperation and partnership that has developed between my Government and the United Nations system as a whole , as well as the efforts under way to end this deplorable situation and fully implement norms and principles on the rights of the child and on their protection , we must nevertheless recognize that , at the time , the response of the United Nations , the international community and donor countries did not meet our expectations . Reasons having to do with security , inaccessibility and , frankly , a lack of confidence in the capacity and the will of my Government to implement its policies to protect the rights of the child resulted in the United Nations being very late in providing support to my Government with regard to formulating appropriate policies to protect children in armed conflict and implementing initiatives , particularly outreach initiatives and those aimed at raising awareness . Nevertheless – pursuant to the relevant provisions of resolution 1261 ( 1999 ) of 25 August 1999 , in which the Security Council called upon States and the relevant parts of the United Nations system to intensify their efforts to end the recruitment and use of children in armed conflict – I would like to reaffirm to the Council that the Democratic Republic of the Congo has ended the enlistment of children in the Congolese armed forces . That is in contrast to the behaviour of the armed groups that hold sway in occupied provinces , which continue to employ child soldiers in the theatre of military operations . A process of demobilization for child soldiers is now taking place under the supervision of BUNADER and UNICEF . However , the future of those soldiers continues to be of major concern and to pose an immense problem . When one takes into account the fact that serious acts of banditry , particularly in Kinshasa , are being carried out by armed young people , one has to wonder about the wisdom of launching these young people into the world without any financial incentives or viable possibilities to reintegrate into society , especially as we are dealing with young people in their prime who know how to handle weapons . This phenomenon represents a time bomb for the entire Congolese society , as well as a real problem that the United Nations is tackling very timidly and one that the Government alone can not address due to a lack of funds . It is important that steps be taken not only immediately but also through the implementation of chapter VI of the comprehensive , inclusive agreement on the transition in the Democratic Republic of the Congo , relating to the training of our national army . We must all take concrete action very quickly . Paragraph 55 of the report of the Secretary-General under consideration ( S / 2002 / 1299 ) mentions a commitment by the World Bank and donor countries to support a regional multi-country demobilization and reintegration programme for the entire Great Lakes region . To us , such a commitment still seems to be a long way off . Last Thursday , France made 1 million euros available to the United Nations Development Programme . Of that amount , 200,000 euros are immediately available for a programme to return to civilian life foreign ex-combatants located in the Democratic Republic of the Congo . France's contribution , following a contribution of 2 million euros to the funds of the World Bank , gives France the leading rank in support for the disarmament , demobilization , repatriation , resettlement and reintegration programme of United Nations Organization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo ( MONUC ) . That will greatly assist the return of foreign ex-combatants – including the child soldiers among them – to their countries of origin and their families and homes . Furthermore , implementing the relevant provisions of resolutions 1314 ( 2000 ) and 1379 ( 2001 ) , MONUC has established child protection units . But given the proliferation of armed groups and their dispersion , and given the size of our national territory , one might question their effectiveness and advocate a substantial increase in the number of their personnel within MONUC so that they can be more effective . The international community is also called on to help the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the implementation by the Government and the future transition authorities of the relevant recommendations made by the delegates to the inter-Congolese dialogue . The war of aggression that has raged in my country for four years now , in violation of the United Nations Charter , has not only given rise to the phenomenon of child soldiers , whose forced recruitment continues in the occupied provinces . For children , this war has brought a succession of miseries , of which they are the first victims . Thousands of them survive , marginalized throughout the country , cut off from society and their own families , living in the streets alone or in groups , sexually exploited and abused , breaking the law , without protection or future . This war of aggression has also led to the forced , brutal and tragic displacement of populations within the borders of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and has forced many Congolese into exile in neighbouring countries . It has also encouraged all kinds of violations of fundamental human rights , particularly those related to the physical integrity of women and children . My delegation wishes to express my Government's concern at the events currently taking place in the east , in Uvira , and further north , in Beni , Mambasa , Bunia , Kilo , Mongwalu and Mahagi . A major humanitarian crisis has been created , especially due to the forced displacement of thousands of people , which has been confirmed by MONUC . Purely commercial reasons are at the base of this upsurge in tension , in which , through opposing Congolese factions , Ugandan generals and Rwandan businessmen equally attempt to gain control of the goldmines of Kilo-Moto and of the Mongwalu area . My Government denounces the delaying tactics employed by Rwanda and Uganda , as well as their manoeuvring to prolong the war in the Democratic Republic of the Congo . Those two countries , after signing agreements with my country , were quick to incite new rebellions and create new warlords . Uganda created the Union des patriotes congolais ( UPC ) – headed by Mr. Thomas Lubanga , a notorious hostage-taker and known criminal – which is not a signatory of the Pretoria Agreement . For its part , Rwanda has given the present Governor of Nord-Kivu , Mr. Serufuli , responsibility for leading a militia of almost 20,000 men , essentially Hutus released from the prisons of Rwanda by the Kigali Government , with the mission of sowing terror , looting and committing massacres among the civilian population . My Government expresses its dismay at information reporting widespread cases of looting and mass rape of women and girls and summary and extrajudicial executions perpetrated by the Mouvement pour le libération du Congo ( MLC ) and its ally , the Rassemblement congolais pour la démocratie-National ( RCD-N ) , as well as by the UPC . My Government is scandalized by the discovery of mass graves in Mambasa , where violent clashes continue between , on the one side , the troops of the Rassemblement congolais pour la démocratie – Mouvement de libération ( RCD-ML ) and on the other , the troops of the RCD-N , in coalition with the MLC . My Government is shocked at the allegations made by representatives of the Catholic Church and non-governmental organizations for the defence of human rights alleging acts of cannibalism by soldiers of the MLC and the RCD-N , principally and specifically targeting pygmy populations and the Nande people . My Government awaits the conclusions of the investigation carried out by the United Nations and hopes that those conclusions will be made public so that light will be shed on that indescribable act of terror and those dreadful events . If that unimaginable barbaric savagery turns out to be true , my Government would ask the Security Council to take against the alleged perpetrators , authors and those responsible all measures authorized under the Charter of the United Nations in order to stop those atrocities and crimes , which now fall within the purview of the International Criminal Court . In conclusion , my Government appeals to all our international , regional and subregional partners to help us carry out our programme to promote and to protect the rights of children . There is an urgent need to renew international commitments to make children a priority so that we do not waste the most precious human resource in the world and to build a stable and productive society . The future of the Democratic Republic of the Congo lies in the well-being of its children . Investing in children today will ensure peace , stability , security , democracy and sustainable development for present and future generations . The President ( spoke in French ) : I thank the representative of the Democratic Republic of the Congo for his kind words addressed to my country . The next speaker inscribed on my list is the representative of Burundi . I invite him to take a seat at the Council table and to make his statement . Mr. Nteturuye ( Burundi ) ( spoke in French ) : My delegation is sincerely pleased to see you , Sir , presiding over the work of the Security Council for the first time since you assumed your new duties . We wish you every success in your mission . How fortunate that the first public meeting of the Council over which you are presiding is dedicated to the situation of children in armed conflicts , a subject of utmost importance and one to which France has always given special attention . I also congratulate the new members of the Security Council and wish them every success in their noble task . I would like to welcome the presence among us of our brother Mr. Olara Otunnu , who has made such great efforts to raise the awareness of the international community and mobilize it to assist children , whose innocence is brutalized by the belligerents of the conflicts currently raging throughout the world . The report of the Secretary-General ( S / 2002 / 1299 ) before us is extremely clear on the suffering of children in conflicts and on the proposed approaches for a solution , especially through the implementation of international conventions that already exist or are in the process of being adopted . Burundi is mentioned in the report , in which the principal belligerents – the Government , the rebels of the Front pour la défense de la démocratie ( FDD ) and of the Parti pour la libération du peuple hutu / Forces nationales pour la libération ( PALIPEHUTU / FNL ) – are accused of using child soldiers in their conflict . I should like to recall here that the war that has been raging in Burundi since 1993 has particularly affected the vulnerable populations , including children . They are the ones who suffer most from diseases related to the poor hygiene and other negative conditions prevailing in camps for internally displaced persons and refugees . They also suffer most from poor nutrition and food shortages ; the destruction or closing of schools , health clinics and hospitals ; and from the many horrors of war . The phenomenon of street children in urban areas – in Burundi and elsewhere – is a shocking reality of civil war in our States . The task of rehabilitating children therefore is a multidimensional one , as indicated by international norms to protect children in situations of conflict . In Burundi , there is , however , a glimmer of hope for the entire population , and in particular for children . That hope was kindled by the signing of the Arusha Peace Agreement in August 2000 and , more recently , by the signing of a ceasefire between the Transitional Government and the three armed factions . We hope that the armed group that has remained outside of this peace process – the PALIPEHUTU / FNL – will soon join it . The Arusha Peace Agreement makes explicit reference to the rehabilitation of the educational and health sectors for the benefit of children , and there are plans to introduce peace education and tolerance programmes into school curricula . With respect to child soldiers , the Peace Agreement , as well as the ceasefire agreement signed on 2 December 2002 at Arusha with the FDD armed group , both define the ceasefire as , inter alia , the cessation of all acts of violence against the population as well as an end to the use of child soldiers and to sexual violence . The ceasefire agreement also specified in the annex – which is an integral part of the agreement – that the question of child soldiers is one of the technical issues still to be negotiated between the Government and the FDD , and that the Government and the rebel groups must agree on a common solution . Such a solution can be found in the disarmament , demobilization , reintegration and repatriation or resettlement programme , which is the most important part of the ceasefire agreement , and for which , thankfully , the international community has planned substantial funding , within the framework of a possible United Nations peacekeeping mission in Burundi . As concerns the Government , we recognize the existence of child soldiers recruited on a voluntary basis due to a lack of other options following unsuccessful primary schooling . In 1989 we signed the Convention on the Rights of the Child , and then , in 2001 , the Optional Protocol to that Convention on the involvement of children in armed conflict . Ratification proceedings are under way . We have already set up , jointly with the United Nations Children's Fund , a programme for the demobilization of child soldiers , and a census of these children is under way . However , with respect to the armed groups , the situation is quite distressing , because , following the signing of the ceasefire agreement on 2 December 2002 , the FDD rebels carried out a forced mass recruitment of young schoolchildren and students , promising them the world , including military ranks and large sums of money , which the international community was to give them if some of them were to be demobilized some day . This attitude should be condemned by the Security Council , because it is cynical , anachronistic and constitutes a violation of the ceasefire and of the agreed truce . Let me recall here that the Burundian armed groups are notorious for the horrific killing of children in boarding schools – the most infamous being the burning alive in 1993 of dozens of Kibimba Normal School students , as well as the slaughter of young seminarians in Buta in 1996 , who were killed in cold blood because they refused to group themselves by ethnicity , as had been ordered by the FDD rebel execution squad . The rebels also have excelled in the destruction of schools and hospitals , as well as in the kidnapping of schoolchildren and students under the age of 15 , with the goal of recruiting them or making them carry plundered goods . As the report points out , these actions are true war crimes , which , thankfully , the International Criminal Court plans to prosecute . The challenge raised by the situation of children in the Burundian conflict can be taken up now that the combatants seem to want to put an end to the war . Once the war has ended , the national and international community will be able to reweave the physical , social and moral fabric of the country . Children will once again be able to smile and to live a full and happy life with their parents – who themselves will welcome the chance to rebuild their lives in a reconciled nation . We ask the international community and the Security Council in particular to continue to help Burundi , so that it may continue forward on the path to peace . The President ( spoke in French ) : The next speaker inscribed on my list is the representative of Japan . I invite him to take a seat at the Council table and to make his statement . Ms. Saiga ( Japan ) : As all of us here will acknowledge with regret , the majority of victims and casualties in recent conflicts have been civilians , of whom the most vulnerable are children . Children are the most negatively affected by armed conflicts , as they are the victims of attacks , landmines and violence on the one hand , while being exploited as child soldiers on the other . We all bear responsibility for safeguarding the rights and welfare of children , who are the basis of the future development of any society . It is therefore commendable that the Security Council has regularly been taking up this important subject since 1998 . The Minister for Foreign Affairs of Japan , Yoriko Kawaguchi , is advocating what is referred to as the "" consolidation of peace "" , which is a new pillar of our foreign policy . This consolidation of peace includes a feature under which Japan would provide early support to local communities , before the achievement of any formal peace agreement . This initiative not only provides local people with assistance at a crucial time of need , but also gives critical momentum to the peace process by enabling them to enjoy the dividends of peace . That approach is more proactive than our conventional approach , which had focused on rehabilitation and the reconstruction of a country after the signing of a peace accord . Specifically , in order to ensure that children enjoy those dividends of peace , Japan has made a variety of concrete efforts to protect and assist children in situations of armed conflict . One example is the "" Back to School "" campaign in Afghanistan , which the United Nations Children's Fund has been advancing , with the financial support of Japan . Other examples of Japan's efforts in this area are school reconstruction and education reactivation in Kosovo , Timor-Leste and Côte d ' Ivoire ; assistance to internally displaced children in Somalia ; and landmine awareness education in Afghanistan , Angola and the Sudan , to name just a few countries . I should like , on behalf of the Japanese Government , to make a number of comments regarding the United Nations work on children and armed conflict . First , we would like to express our appreciation to the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Children and Armed Conflict , Mr. Olara Otunnu , for his activities , including field visits to countries caught in or recovering from armed conflict , since such visits can contribute to the promotion of awareness of the importance of the protection of children in situations of armed conflict , who need special attention for their survival . The annex to the most recent report of the Secretary-General includes a list of certain parties to armed conflicts that recruit or use child soldiers . It is not sufficient simply to denounce those who are responsible , but every possible effort – for example , awareness raising and eradicating the culture of impunity – must be made to bring such practices to an end . Secondly , a number of United Nations agencies have been actively involved in the issue of children and armed conflict , including the Office of the Special Representative , field-based implementing agencies and various departments at Headquarters . In order for such agencies to use the limited resources available in an effective and efficient manner , inter-agency coordination and periodic review and streamlining of their activities are of great importance . Japan therefore welcomes the adoption by the General Assembly of resolution 57 / 190 , entitled "" Rights of the child "" , which calls for a comprehensive assessment of the response of the United Nations system to the issue of children and armed conflict . It is hoped that concrete and bold ideas for the reform of United Nations activities in this area will be submitted , based upon achievements to date and changing needs on the ground . Thirdly , Japan is pleased that the Security Council has been regularly addressing the subject of children and armed conflict , as well as those of the protection of civilians in armed conflict and women , peace and security , as the issue of the protection of civilians , including women and children , is part and parcel of the maintenance of international peace and security . As my Government has frequently pointed out , however , the three subjects are intricately intertwined and thus should be addressed in an integrated manner . For instance , those three issues might well be addressed under a single agenda item . In conclusion , I am convinced that under your leadership , Mr. President , a resolution will be adopted that contributes to the improvement of the situation of children suffering as a result of conflict . The President ( spoke in French ) : The next speaker inscribed on my list is the representative of Namibia . I invite him to take a seat at the Council table and to make his statement . Mr. Andjaba ( Namibia ) : Permit me at the outset , Sir , to express my delegation's satisfaction at seeing see you presiding over the work of the Security Council this month , and to thank you for having convened this very important meeting . I would also like to take this opportunity to warmly congratulate the new members of the Council and to pledge my delegation's full support to them . Allow me also to pay tribute to the outgoing members of the Council for the excellent manner in which they participated in the Council's work over the past two years . I would like to thank the Secretary-General for his statement this morning and for his thought-provoking report , which reviews activities and progress made in the protection of children affected by situations of armed conflict . This report goes a step further than a mere review of the situation ; it provides a list of parties to armed conflict that recruit or use children in violation of relevant international obligations , and highlights the plight of children in conflicts that are not on the agenda of the Security Council . We see this step as a positive development in our efforts to protect the most vulnerable in our society . I wish to commend the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Children and Armed Conflict , Mr. Olara Otunnu , as well as Ms. Carol Bellamy , Executive Director of the United Nations Children's Fund , for the information that they provided today . Their tireless work and actions are clear testimony of their strong and unwavering commitment to protect children everywhere . It is encouraging to note from the report that impressive gains have been made in codifying international norms and standards for the protection and well-being of children . My delegation applauds this progress , since , as has been stated many times by the Council , the impact of conflict on children has severe implications , not only for peace and security , but also for socio-economic development . These positive developments should be built upon by the international community to ensure that children are forever protected against the consequences of war . Further efforts should be made to ensure that the standards according to which children are treated are implemented on the ground , and that permanent monitoring and reporting mechanisms are created in order to identify and adopt measures against violations . As responsible members of the international community , we must move with a great sense of urgency – and move beyond mere words . We must take concrete actions to practise what we preach . And we must not forget the children that are today suffering under foreign occupation and domination . Here , I speak of the children of Palestine and the children of Western Sahara . We must summon the necessary courage and political will to bring the suffering of those children to an end by ensuring that their countries attain their inalienable right to self-determination . The Security Council has a Charter responsibility in that regard . For its part , Namibia will continue to contribute to all efforts aimed at protecting future generations from the evils of armed conflict . It is for those reasons that Namibia was at the forefront in getting the Security Council involved in addressing the plight of children in armed conflict during our tenure in the Council in 1999 and 2000 . We therefore strongly supported resolutions 1261 ( 1999 ) and 1314 ( 2000 ) , which were adopted during that period . Resolution 1261 ( 1999 ) , in particular , heightened international attention with regard to this issue , which resulted in the progress that we are seeing today . Furthermore , we believe that the entry into force of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court and of the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child will have a profound impact that will contribute to achieving this goal . The provisions of the Optional Protocol will result in a sharp decrease in the number of young children recruited for war , and the Rome Statute will be a strong deterrent to war crimes such as sexual violence against children . Namibia strongly supports both instruments and will work tirelessly to ensure that their provisions are fully implemented . Other specific concerns of my delegation are the disproportionate impact of conflicts on girls and the devastation caused by HIV / AIDS . In many instances , the trauma of girls is compounded when they are infected with deadly diseases through sexual violence during times of war and peace . My delegation therefore urges the Security Council to continue to devote special attention to the needs of girls and to the effects of HIV / AIDS . Before I conclude , I wish to make an observation . The report before us ( S / 2002 / 1299 ) , in paragraph 55 , mentions Namibia together with several other countries where the World Bank and other donors have committed themselves to give priority to the unconditional and urgent demobilization of child soldiers in a Multi-Country Demobilization and Reintegration Programme for the Greater Great Lakes Region . The language of the paragraph , as it stands , could be misinterpreted to mean that Namibia also has child soldiers to be demobilized , although that is not directly stated . I should like to make it very clear that Namibia does not have or recruit child soldiers , because that is against the supreme law of our land , the Constitution of the Republic of Namibia . Finally , my delegation urges the Council to act expeditiously on the information provided to it in the report under discussion . The paramount consideration should be that more needs to be done to protect children from the scourge of war . The President ( spoke in French ) : The next speaker inscribed on my list is the representative of Ecuador . I invite him to take a seat at the Council table and to make his statement . Mr. Gallegos Chiriboga ( Ecuador ) ( spoke in Spanish ) : It is an honour to speak before you , Sir , representative of a friendly country such as France . At the same time , I should like to express my delegation's congratulations to the former President of the Council , the representative of Colombia , on his excellent work during his tenure . I should also like to congratulate the representatives of Angola , Chile , Germany , Pakistan and Spain , who have just joined the Council . First of all , I should like to express Ecuador's gratitude to the Secretary-General for his new and important report on children and armed conflict ( S / 2002 / 1299 ) , in which he presents an account of activities undertaken and progress achieved related to that crucial issue during the period of the report . We express our congratulations to the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Children and Armed Conflict on his valuable initiatives and on the commitments reached in various countries in order to ensure the protection and well-being of children during and after conflicts , as well as compliance with obligations arising from international law . We encourage the Special Representative to continue to undertake all necessary efforts , in coordination with the competent bodies , to achieve increasingly significant results and commitments . It is also important to highlight – as the Secretary-General did in his report – the adoption by the General Assembly of the document "" A world fit for children "" , annexed to resolution S-27 / 2 , in which the Assembly agreed on a renewed commitment to protect children during armed conflicts , in accordance with international humanitarian law and human rights law . The Security Council resolutions in that area and effective compliance with them are also important means to contribute to that objective . Other important advances in that sphere are the entry into force of the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the involvement of children in armed conflict , as well as the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court , which ensures that the gravest significant crimes for the international community – among which are crimes committed specifically against children – will not go unpunished . The strengthening of international law in that sphere , respect for it and effective application of it are indispensable in order to guarantee the necessary protection for children , especially in the light of the persistence of conflicts of all kinds in various regions of the world . We also welcome the progress that has been made in the incorporation of the issue of the protection of children as an essential component of the work of peacemaking , peace-building and peacekeeping . One of the saddest and most tragic realities that we see in various parts of the world today is the unspeakable suffering experienced by the innocent and most helpless victims of society – children – as a result of armed conflicts . The report of the Secretary-General describes that intolerable reality , including the risks to which children are exposed as a result of landmines , unexploded ordnance and small arms and light weapons . It also discusses the serious situation of displaced children and the exploitation and abuses of every kind to which children are exposed . Therefore , the international community must accord high priority to the situation through the implementation of better concrete measures to guarantee children's most fundamental rights and to mitigate and prevent the pernicious effects that armed conflicts have on them . In his report , the Secretary-General also emphasizes the problems related to child soldiers . Nothing is more inhuman and more contrary to the highest values of any society than the fact that , instead of toys , children are forced or permitted to handle instruments of death ; that human beings , in the earliest stages of their existence , are dragged into violence , confrontation and destruction . The solution to this problem must , of course , be a United Nations priority . Ecuador wishes to note the list included in the Secretary-General's report , at the request of the Security Council , of the parties to armed conflict that recruit or use child soldiers , in violation of applicable international obligations . This is an important development , through which we no longer speak in general terms concerning the brutal realities that exist in various regions and fully identified areas . Instead , we are identifying specific parties , which will allow us to encourage State and non-State actors involved to alter their behaviour and to adhere to the basic norms of human rights and international humanitarian law . Although much remains to be done , the progress noted by the Secretary-General in his report on the issue of protecting children in armed conflict , while limited , is praiseworthy . We hope that it will continue and that the necessary efforts and actions will be stepped up in order to ensure that the world can truly become a place fit for children . The President ( spoke in French ) : The next speaker inscribed on my list is the Permanent Observer of Palestine . I invite him to take a seat at the Council table and to make his statement . Mr. Al-Kidwa ( Palestine ) ( spoke in Arabic ) : At the outset , let me express our great satisfaction at seeing you , Sir , preside over our Council . You are a skilful diplomat well known throughout the United Nations . I am pleased to see France , a friendly country , at the helm of the Council . Although Colombia is no longer a member of the Security Council , I should also like to take this opportunity to convey our thanks and appreciation to the friendly delegation of that country and to Ambassador Valdivieso for his presidency of the Council last month and to wish him every success . We also thank the former members whose membership lapsed at the end of the year , congratulate the new members and wish them every success . Over the past 28 months , the children of Palestine have been subject to systematic murderous action by Israel , the occupying Power . During this period , the occupying forces of Israel have committed war crimes and acts of State terrorism , as well as systematic violations of the rights of Palestinian children and of the Palestinian people in general . The occupying forces , both deliberately and through the indiscriminate or excessive use of force , have killed over 650 Palestinian children and wounded thousands more , hundreds of whom have been permanently disabled . Through the use of force , widespread destruction and the collective punishment of the entire Palestinian community , the occupying forces have also inflicted psychological disorders and emotional and social damage on huge numbers of Palestinian children . Above all , Israeli measures and practices have impoverished Palestinian children , who consequently suffer malnutrition and lack of health care , and have halted and destroyed the educational system , leading to the spread of ignorance among future generations . All of this is occurring against the backdrop of Israel's ongoing occupation of our land for over 35 years , during which the occupying forces have not only oppressed and suppressed the population , but have also practised settler colonialism , one of the worst possible war crimes . The settler colonialism , which denies our people's rights to exist and survive and to national independence , further inhibits the Palestinian child's right to a natural and normal future , such as that enjoyed by any child throughout the world . To all of this we must add Israel's uprooting of half our population – including children and women – from their lands and homes since 1948 and its prevention of their return for over 50 years . We can thus realize the magnitude of the great humanitarian crisis and plight of Palestinian children at the hands of the leaders and forces of Israel , who are war criminals and the colonialists of the twentieth century . The efforts of the Security Council in the field of children and armed conflict complement the great work of the General Assembly . In this respect , we express our appreciation for the efforts of the General Assembly in addressing the situation of Palestinian children . The Israeli Chargé d ' affaires , with all his well-known arrogance , earlier attacked and criticized the General Assembly resolution concerning Palestinian children . Only four members , whom I shall not name , voted against that resolution . It may be possible in a professional context for the representative of the occupying Power to seek to defend the illegal and illicit behaviour of his country , but it is intolerable and disgusting that he should try to tell Member States what to do and to portray the occupying Power as a State that obeys and observes international law and loves peace . We welcome the improvement of the Security Council's position concerning the question of children and armed conflict through its acceptance of the legal necessity of addressing the issue of children under foreign occupation . This logically leads to the issue of Palestinian children under Israeli occupation . We also welcome the improvement of the Secretary-General's report in this context and the reference made therein to Palestinian children and their suffering , although the reference inadequately covers all the essential aspects of the issue . The same can be said of the statement made this morning by the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Children and Armed Conflict , Mr. Olara Otunnu , in which he added to the relevant paragraph of the Secretary-General's report another paragraph on the use of suicide bombings in Israel . Although we do not disagree in principle , we nevertheless do not understand part of the text in that additional paragraph . More important , we believe that the two paragraphs do not clearly reflect either the situation or its legal aspects ; nor do they reflect the tragic situation experienced by Palestinian children for many years now . Nevertheless , this is a beginning that we hope will develop in an appropriate manner , including a visit by the Special Representative to occupied Palestinian lands , including Al-Quds Al-Sharif . We convey our welcome to him in advance . We hope that the Security Council will take the steps needed to provide the necessary protection for Palestinian children living under Israeli occupation , not only in accordance with the Convention on the Rights of the Child and its relevant Optional Protocol but also with the legal commitments emanating from the Fourth Geneva Convention – which must be respected in all circumstances , as must its Additional Protocol I. The President ( spoke in French ) : The representative of Israel has asked to speak . I invite him to take a seat at the Council table and to make his statement . Mr. Mekel ( Israel ) : I regret that I am forced to take the floor again in this debate . We had hoped that this discussion would not turn into an exchange regarding the particularities of the situation in the Middle East . Unfortunately , that has not been the case . In the course of today's debate , a few speakers – in particular the Palestinian observer – have used the issue of children in armed conflict to single out Israel for criticism and condemnation . Such criticism directed at one country , and at one country alone , is not intended to alleviate the situation facing Palestinian children or , for that matter , the situation facing any group of children living under the threat of armed conflict . Rather , it is intended to advance a political agenda and to isolate my country . For that reason , I am compelled to make a second intervention . The situation facing the Palestinian people , including Palestinian children , is a serious one . Israel shares the concern of the international community over their plight and has taken steps to improve the humanitarian situation of all Palestinians . It must be stressed , however , that this situation is first and foremost a product of the decision of the Palestinian leadership to engage in violence , to pursue confrontation in place of negotiations and to encourage , finance and support a deliberate campaign of terrorism against the people of Israel . While it may be convenient to place full blame for the plight of the Palestinian people on Israel's shoulders , the fact remains that the Palestinian leadership , which chose to forego a viable political process in favour of a bloody campaign of terrorism , is primarily responsible for the difficult situation we are currently facing . Israel has never , and will never , intentionally target Palestinian children or any unarmed civilian . We recognize that , in the course of our battle with Palestinian terrorists , civilians have suffered . Those cases are deeply regrettable ; but , in contrast to Palestinian terrorists who have deliberately targeted school buses , discos and other areas where children are known to congregate , Israel has gone to great lengths – and at considerable risk to its own security – to ensure that its counter-terrorist operations are conducted so as to reduce the threat to civilians as much as possible . Those who are genuinely concerned about the situation of Palestinian children must scrutinize and condemn the criminal behaviour of Palestinian terrorists , who have obscured the fundamental distinction between civilians and combatants , set up camps in civilian refugee areas , used Palestinian civilians , including children , as human shields and used private homes and schools as bases from which to launch attacks against Israel , in grave violation of international humanitarian law and Security Council resolutions . The international community must loudly condemn the practices of Palestinian leaders , who have actively encouraged the participation of Palestinian children in armed conflict , elevated suicide terrorists to the status of national heroes and urged children to follow their examples . If delegations truly care about Palestinian children , they must first and foremost address the shameful practices of Palestinian leaders and terrorists that have led too many Palestinian children to believe that murder and death are noble pursuits . However , if their purpose is simply to exploit another United Nations discussion to attack and defame Israel , let those delegations find a more appropriate forum . On an issue as urgent and critical as protecting children , we can ill afford to allow our discussions to be tainted by such naked political hostility . The President ( spoke in French ) : The representative of Rwanda has asked to speak . I invite him to take a seat at the Council table and to make his statement . Mr. Gasana ( Rwanda ) ( spoke in French ) : A moment ago , the Permanent Representative of the Democratic Republic of the Congo made an attempt to confuse the members of the Council . Fortunately , absurdity never killed anybody . The representative of the Democratic Republic of the Congo sought to sully and to tarnish Rwanda's image by saying that Rwanda had sent 20,000 prisoners to the Democratic Republic of the Congo . I would like to say to the Council that that was a lie , pure and simple . I would ask everyone present here not to take the representative of the Democratic Republic of the Congo seriously . The Security Council should not be a forum for insults . The President ( spoke in French ) : The Permanent Observer of Palestine has asked for the floor . I invite him to take a seat at the Council table and to make his statement . Mr. Al-Kidwa ( Palestine ) ( spoke in Arabic ) : I am sorry to once again take up the Council's precious time , but I would like to make the following brief points in response to the second intervention by the Israeli representative . First , any attempt by Israel to depict its criminal acts against our people as a reaction to acts of violence by Palestinians is a false attempt . Suffice it for me to refer to the continuation of the occupation for more than 35 years and to the transfer by Israel of 400,000 settlers to that land , in grave violation of the Fourth Geneva Convention and many Security Council resolutions , in order to occupy the land and to prevent the Palestinians from exercising their rights . The occupation , its abhorrent practices and settler colonialism are what led to the violent reaction by our people , not the contrary . Secondly , Israel's claims that it has mitigated the suffering of our people are ridiculous . I need only refer to the report of the Secretary-General on the humanitarian situation . Thirdly , the claim that Israel , the occupying Power , has not targeted civilians or children is also a lie . When an Israeli warplane drops a one-ton bomb on a residential area of Gaza , that act constitutes a deliberate murder of civilians . Two days ago , when an Israeli helicopter fired a missile at a certain car in a highly populated area in Gaza , resulting in the death of two children , aged 14 and 15 , it was a deliberate murder of civilians . Israel , the occupying Power , has deliberately murdered civilians through the excessive and indiscriminate use of force . Fourthly , the representative of Israel claims that the Palestinian side uses its children as human shields . That is very racist , as well as unacceptable . It reflects a sick mentality . We hope that Israel's representatives and leaders will overcome such thinking in the future . Finally , we once again hope that the international community will truly stand up against the culture of illegal impunity by confronting the war crimes and all other crimes committed by the leaders of Israel as part of the official State policy of successive Israeli Governments , particularly in the last 28 months . We hope such a stance will be taken because it is the only thing that could lend real credibility to the statements of the international community on this issue . Despite all this , we have not yet lost hope for changing both the situation and the Israeli policy and for reaching a just and comprehensive peace in the region , based on two States , Palestine and Israel , living side by side . The President ( spoke in French ) : I now give the floor to the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Children and Armed Conflict , Mr. Olara Otunnu , to respond to comments in a brief intervention , given the lateness of the hour . Mr. Otunnu : I have taken very careful note of the extremely important comments and critiques made by members of the Security Council and other Members of the United Nations . I shall be in continuing dialogue with them , and I shall do everything possible to act on the suggestions and proposals which have been made . At this late hour , I do not intend to respond or to elaborate on any specific suggestion or proposal . Thank you very much , Sir , for your interest and engagement and the commitment of the Security Council . The President ( spoke in French ) : I now give the floor to the Deputy Executive Director of the United Nations Children's Fund , Mr. Kul Gautam , to respond to comments made in a brief statement , given the lateness of the hour . Mr. Gautam : It is late in the day , Sir , as you said , so I will try to be brief . This open debate of the Security Council has been enormously encouraging to us at UNICEF . On behalf of Carol Bellamy , our Executive Director , I would like to thank all Member States that have so generously acknowledged UNICEF's work in the demobilization and reintegration of children in situations of armed conflict in many countries . We will convey your words of appreciation and encouragement and your sense of solidarity to our field staff , who work day in and day out to try to help children in difficult circumstances . I know it will be a tremendous inspiration to them . I would also like to take this occasion to acknowledge and pay a special tribute to our non-governmental organization partners . There are very few of them left here . But I know that there is a large number of them outside , watching the proceedings of the Council . Their work and collaboration are of tremendous value to the work of the United Nations . We could not be as effective as we are without their passion , support and solidarity . As many delegations highlighted , prevention is better than cure . A major contribution by UNICEF and our partner organizations to ensure that all children are helped to enjoy childhood to their full potential requires investing in basic services and reaching the Millennium Development Goals , which are very important for the development of children . We were particularly happy to hear so many delegations referring to the commitment that our leaders made to "" A world fit for children "" . Indeed , if we can implement some of the goals , targets and objectives of "" A world fit for children "" , we will do well for children in difficult circumstances , in armed conflict and otherwise . Let me mention just two or three specific things that we take to heart . Several delegations reminded us that the illicit traffic in small arms contributes enormously to violence . We share their concerns and hope that there will be a stronger response in that area . We are encouraged by the comments made by many delegations on the need to ensure that the list in the annex to the Secretary-General's report is developed , strengthened , expanded , reviewed and made more of a practical tool . We hope that these statements will be reflected in the Council's resolution , when it is adopted in the next few days . Many delegations made specific suggestions and recommendations for the follow-up to the Secretary-General's report . Austria , speaking on behalf of the Human Security Network , made 10 very specific and concrete proposals . We trust that some of those very specific and pertinent points will be reflected in the draft resolution that the Council is to adopt in the next few days . The Council's debate today , and the draft resolution that it will soon adopt , will provide powerful encouragement and support for all of us to redouble our efforts to protect children from the barbarity of armed conflict and to help them build , and live in , a more peaceful world – a world that is fit for children . The President ( spoke in French ) : I thank the Deputy Executive Director of the United Nations Children's Fund for his statement . There are no further speakers inscribed on my list . The Security Council has thus concluded the present stage of its consideration of the item on its agenda . The meeting rose at 7.55 p. m . This record contains the text of speeches delivered in English and of the interpretation of speeches delivered in the other languages . The final text will be printed in the Official Records of the Security Council . Corrections should be submitted to the original languages only . They should be incorporated in a copy of the record and sent under the signature of a member of the delegation concerned to the Chief of the Verbatim Reporting Service , room C-154A . </doc>

933,A4,"The face seemed more heavy and more wrinkled , while that ominous venous tinge was more pronounced as he panted up the hill . The clean lines of his cheek and chin were marred by a day's growth of grey stubble , and his large , shapely head had lost something of the brave carriage which had struck me when first I glanced at him . He had a letter there , the same , or another , but still in a woman's hand , and over this he was moping and mumbling in his senile fashion , with his brow puckered , and the corners of his mouth drawn down like those of a fretting child . So I left him , with a vague wonder as to who he might be , and why a single spring day should have wrought such a change upon him . So interested was I that next morning I was on the look out for him . Sure enough , at the same hour , I saw him coming up the hill ; but very slowly , with a bent back and a heavy head . It was shocking to me to see the change in him as he approached . "" I am afraid that our air does not agree with you , sir , "" I ventured to remark . But it was as though he had no heart for talk . He tried , as I thought , to make some fitting reply , but it slurred off into a mumble and silence . How bent and weak and old he seemed--ten years older at the least than when first I had seen him ! It went to my heart to see this fine old fellow wasting away before my eyes . There was the eternal letter which he unfolded with his shaking fingers . Who was this woman whose words moved him so ? Some daughter , perhaps , or granddaughter , who should have been the light of his home instead of ---- I smiled to find how bitter I was growing , and how swiftly I was weaving a romance round an unshaven old man and his correspondence . Yet all day he lingered in my mind , and I had fitful glimpses of those two trembling , blue-veined , knuckly hands with the paper rustling between them . I had hardly hoped to see him again . Another day's decline must , I thought , hold him to his room , if not to his bed . Great , then , was my surprise when , as I approached my bench , I saw that he was already there . But as I came up to him I could scarce be sure that it was indeed the same man . There were the curly-brimmed hat , and the shining stock , and the horn glasses , but where were the stoop and the grey-stubbled , pitiable face ? He was clean - shaven and firm lipped , with a bright eye and a head that poised itself upon his great shoulders like an eagle on a rock . His back was as straight and square as a grenadier's , and he switched at the pebbles with his stick in his exuberant vitality . In the button - hole of his well-brushed black coat there glinted a golden blossom , and the corner of a dainty red silk handkerchief lapped over from his breast pocket . He might have been the eldest son of the weary creature who had sat there the morning before . "" Good morning , Sir , good morning ! "" he cried with a merry waggle of his cane . "" Good morning ! "" I answered how beautiful the bay is looking . "" "" Yes , Sir , but you should have seen it just before the sun rose . "" "" What , have you been here since then ? "" "" I was here when there was scarce light to see the path . "" "" You are a very early riser . "" "" On occasion , sir ; on occasion ! "" He cocked his eye at me as if to gauge whether I were worthy of his confidence . "" The fact is , sir , that my wife is coming back to me to day . "" I suppose that my face showed that I did not quite see the force of the explanation . My eyes , too , may have given him assurance of sympathy , for he moved quite close to me and began speaking in a low , confidential voice , as if the matter were of such weight that even the sea-gulls must be kept out of our councils . "" Are you a married man , Sir ? "" "" No , I am not . "" "" Ah , then you can not quite understand it . My wife and I have been married for nearly fifty years , and we have never been parted , never at all , until now . "" "" Was it for long ? "" I asked . "" Yes , sir . This is the fourth day . She had to go to Scotland . A matter of duty , you understand , and the doctors would not let me go . </doc>

See full bio Nissan's hottest Z-car is an aging prizefighter that 's still got the moves Roadshow Editors' Rating 6.2 Overall Performance 8 Features 4 Design 8 Media & Connectivity 4 The Good The 2017 Nissan 370Z Nismo's performance upgrades transform the sports coupe into a street-legal race car . The firm suspension offers great track feel and the wide , sticky tires give plenty of grip when cornering . SynchroRev Match makes every shift a perfectly timed one . The Bad The $ 3 , 500 Tech package adds outdated navigation and an eight-speaker audio system . You could do better with a smartphone . The firm ride and narrow seats are punishing over rough roads and for longer trips and the shallow trunk makes the Z impractical as a daily driver . The Bottom Line After experiencing it at the track , I 'm seeing the 2017 Nissan 370Z Nismo in a totally new light . However , as the competition continues to refine , the Z is a tough sell for all but the most hard-core . I can admit it : I was wrong ... sort of . The last time I saw the Nissan 370Z Nismo , I did n't love it . The ride was harsh on the street , the boy-racer aerodynamics were just obnoxious , the tech felt a decade old and the performance bump did n't feel like it was worth the significant price bump over the standard Z. This time , after spending a week with the 2017 Nissan 370Z Nismo , I caught myself considering buying one of my own . This car 's not so different from the one I drove before , so what gives ? Handling upgrades The laundry list of Nismo upgrades is of the old-fashioned sort : big wheels , meaty tires , stiff suspension and naturally aspirated power . It 's not the first car that I 've described as Japanese muscle , but it 's probably the one that fits the description best . Working from the ground up , the Z Nismo's upgrades start with a set of sticky Bridgestone Potenza S001 high-performance tires . The rubber is wrapped around 19-inch forged alloy wheels built for Nismo by Rays , a manufacturer of high-end racing and tuner wheels . The wheels feature a staggered fit with 9 . 5-inch wide rollers up front and even wider 10 . 5-inch wheels out back . The Z Nismo has more contact patch on its rear axle than many cars have at all four corners . Antuan Goodwin / Roadshow On display behind the wheels' spokes are bright red sports brakes . The Nismo uses four-piston aluminum calipers on 14 . 0-inch discs and two-piston calipers on 13 . 8-inch discs for the front and rear axles , respectively . But Nissan's tuning division did n't stop there ; it also upgraded the brake lines with rigidity hoses and filled the system with R35 Special II brake fluid to reduce fade at high temperatures such as those you 'd experience at the track . Still working up , the chassis is suspended over the rolling stock with a Nismo-tuned suspension with stiffer springs , dampers and stabilizer bars . In the engine bay , the strut towers are tied together and to the body with a reinforced 3-point brace . After all of that stiffening , Nismo has also installed front and rear chassis dampers to help cut down some of the vibration and harshness over rough surfaces . Even with the chassis dampers the Nismo is a pretty loud and rough ride over uneven pavement and city streets . One of my biggest nitpicks with the previous iteration of the Z Nismo was that the aerodynamics package was just a bit too boy-racerish , too attention grabbing and just plain goofy looking . The 2017 370Z Nismo has a smaller rear spoiler that no longer blocks what little rear visibility the Z has to offer . The GT-R-inspired body kit is plainly more attractive than the old catfish fascia . Inside the cabin , the driver and one passenger wedge into a set of Nismo / Recaro racing seats with Alcantara inserts . The racing buckets are gorgeous but too tight and uncomfortable on the street . On the track , however , the tall bolstering did an exceptional job of keeping my butt in place during cornering . I 'd go as far as to say that they actually get more comfortable the harder the Z is pushed at the track ; because I did n't have to brace myself with my knees I was freer to see to the business of actually driving closer to the limits ... either that or I was too amped up on adrenaline to notice that my bottom was aching . Meanwhile , the steering wheel and shift lever also both get the Nismo treatment and are wrapped in Alcantara and leather , respectively . If it ai n't broke : Powertrain upgrades Not much has changed in the engine bay , which is just a teensy bit of a disappointment . I can continue to wish for a factory-installed and warrantied twin-turbo system , but I do n't realistically expect any drastic powertrain changes this late in the 370Z's life cycle . The heart of the Z Nismo is essentially the same naturally aspirated , 3 . 7-liter VQ-series engine ( VQ37VHR ) V6 engine that powers the standard 370Z . It 's basically a tweaked and higher displacement version of the VQ35DE that 's powered the Z since the 2003 launch of the 350Z . Nissan puts some variant of the VQ into everything from the Frontier pickup to the Maxima sedan ; it 's a proven and reliable powerplant if nothing else and Nissan seems to be taking an "" if it ai n't broke , do n't fix it "" approach to this element of the Z Nismo's performance . The VQ-Series V6 engine can be found under the hood of many Nissan cars and trucks . Here , it makes a respectable 350 horsepower . Nissan In the Z Nismo , output has been massaged to 350 horsepower and 276 pound-feet of torque ( up from the standard 370Z's 332 horsepower and 270 pound-feet of torque ) thanks to more aggressive tuning . Fuel economy is stated at 26 highway mpg and 18 city mpg . The 370Z Nismo comes standard with a six-speed manual transmission with a feature called SynchroRev Matching . When shifting up or down range , the Z's computer can hold or automatically blip the throttle , matching the engine speed with your new transmission speed for smooth shifting . It 's sort of like an electronic heel-and-toe . If you do n't like the computer intervention , the SynchroRev Matching system can be defeated with a single button press , but I actually found that I liked it . The Rev Matching made me feel like a racing god without getting in my way . There 's also a seven-speed automatic transmission with paddle shifters available , but people will laugh at you when they peek into your Z and only see two pedals .

1495,A12,"Automation and control systems make it possible to open and close the shades or blinds in a home from almost any location . Some systems use a remote control ; others have programmable timers that control the shades . Automated motorized shades provide a number of benefits over traditional window dressings . Comfort and Convenience Comfort and convenience are two benefits of motorized shades especially when they are attached to a timer . Shades can be lowered automatically when the sun hits the side of the home . This prevents rooms from heating up during the day . The shades can also be controlled with a central panel or remote control . This makes it very convenient to adjust the shades throughout the day whenever needed without having to move to every window in every room . Energy Savings Shades attached to automation and control systems will save homeowners money during every season . Closing shades automatically in the summer months keeps rooms cooler so air conditioning can be used less . On cold evenings , closing the shades automatically at night helps when the wind causes uncomfortable drafts in the home . Motorized shades will increase the insulating capacity of the windows , which will lower energy loss and increase the effectiveness of heating and cooling systems . Minimal Maintenance Traditional shades that are moved manually by the homeowner can encounter a number of problems that will require regular maintenance . Shades or blinds can come off the track , which can damage the material . Some shades or blinds can actually become caught in opening or closing mechanisms . This has the potential to damage the shade beyond repair if the components break . Automation and control systems for shades do not rely on physically aligning the mechanisms and materials . The shade will open and close correctly every time without problems . This reduces the need for maintenance over time . Security and Safety The type of shade automation systems that professional electrical services will install can improve the security of a home . Burglars are more likely to attempt robbing a home when it appears no one is home . Programmable shades can work with timed lights to open or close regularly , even if no one is at home or the family is on vacation . The automation becomes an effective deterrent that will keep criminals away . Additionally , motorized shades do not have cords or other hanging parts that can create a hazard for children and pets . Distinctive Appearance Motorized shades or blinds provide a distinctive appearance and atmosphere in the home . They fit the windows better than loose hanging dressings . The typical and sometimes unsightly opening and closing fixtures or cords are not present on automated shades . Since most people do not have motorized shades , they create a unique environment . Opening and closing shades with a remote control can leave a lasting impression on guests . Flexibility Automated shades are more flexible than traditional window dressings when it comes to positioning and functionality . Providers of professional electrical services can install the shades over windows that are too high to reach or in inconvenient locations . The automated controls allow the shades to remain functional whether or not the windows are easily accessible . </doc>

1437,A12,"RESEARCH DEVELOPMENT & RESULTS from Extensive Studies by GolfScape Artificial Turf Manufacturers FACTS & FOES of Nylon vs. Artificial Grass Deep Infill "" Artificial Grass Deep Infill "" Systems vs. Nylon Synthetic putting greens are manufactured with several different materials . Two of the most common materials are polypropylene and nylon . A green made with nylon typically does not take an infill product , whereas a polypropylene green does . It is this artificial grass deep infill process that determines whether you birdie or bogey your game because of the advantage way that a surface , with artificial grass deep infill , reacts to your golf ball while putting and chipping onto the green . Non-filled synthetic putting greens obviously do not require infill . These greens are typically made of the nylon fiber . Nylon is what you see on miniature golf courses . Disadvantages of Nylon Problems with nylon synthetic putting greens : Nylon , a more porous fiber , will absorb water , retain odors , and lead to mold , mildew and fungus growth . Because a nylon green does not normally take an infill material , the fibers will "" mat down "" in a given time . When this happens the ball roll becomes very fast and there 's nothing that can be done to remedy the problem . In an attempt to resolve this issue , some companies will add infill to the turf , but because nylon is not designed to take an infill product , it just wo n't work . Many companies claim nylon fiber is "" heat set "" with "" memory "" and will not mat down . It simply makes sense that if there is nothing to support the fibers upright , they will mat down over time . Also , read the "" fine print "" of these companies' warranties on their nylon greens - "" normal matting or compression of fiber or compression of rubber and foam backing or padding is expressly excluded from the warranty "" . Draw you own conclusion from such contradicting statements . Nylon is a stiffer , more rigid fiber . A rigid fiber can also make the ball "" bounce "" or "" hop "" and not hold the green well . Furthermore , it has to be virtually flat for a nylon green to hold a golf ball . Although nylon greens should be built over a concrete slab , you might as well just take your penalty stroke and start over . Concrete will always crack or will always need joint for contraction and expansion . Joints and cracks will eventually agitate the green's surface creating visible ridges . Vice-versa , nylon turf with urethane backing will actually "" crawl "" across the surface creating wrinkles . A latex backing wo n't do this , but it will retain water and odors and lead to mold , mildew and fungus growth . For sure Stimp speed is not adjustable and undulations are almost nonexistent for a green built on a concrete slab . A concrete slab must have a slope for water drainage . The slope has to funnel water somewhere , which usually means towards the putting holes or all to one side of the green , resulting in puddles of stagnant water ; again leading to rot , mold and growth of fungus . If the nylon turf has a latex or rubber backing or padding , the problem is compounded . Rubber padding will compact and break down , forming irregular dips in the green , similar to what happens to an old worn out couch cushion . Stagnant water can accumulate under those too . Add that to the matted down fibers and you 've scored a "" double-bogey "" of a problem . Nylon fibers tend to be darker . A darker color gives the surface an unnatural blue-green appearance . Do n't take our word for it . Go to the internet and look at the photo galleries of companies selling nylon greens . You will notice greens that are abnormally dark or greens that actually look blue-green . Putting greens should "" accentuate , enhance and blend "" into the surrounding landscape , not detract from it . Nylon has streak lines caused either by inconsistencies of the dye lot or during the shearing process , which runs the length of the turf and can seriously hamper true ball roll . Final Note : Nylon greens cost almost twice as much as polypropylene . But because of the problems associated with nylon greens , you 're getting half of the product for twice the price . All of these problems combined are sure to handicap your short game . After extensive research of the fiber and manufacturing process , we have determined that the technology for nylon putting greens has yet to produce a putting surface that consistently provides true ball roll and holding characteristics of a real grass green . Polypropylene greens are the most realistic looking and have the most consistent surfaces . Its durable fiber can withstand all inclement weather conditions that Mother Nature can hurl at it . This increases the longevity of the green's life . They provide many more options for designing undulations , especially when built over a crushed sub-base . The fibers of an artificial grass deep infilled green are pre-bent and will not mat down over time They are maintenance free - : blow debris off with a leaf blower . Polypropylene greens have proven performance . Some companies claim that the taller the turf , the better the ball roll . They use a 1-1 / 2 turf , which requires much more infill product . More infill means that the fibers will be further apart . More distance between the fibers means the ball can roll on between fibers and infill , which is not a true and consistent ball roll . Usually a 1-1 / 2 fiber is used for the installations of synthetic football and soccer fields . These companies will try to adapt that fiber to a putting green surface , which signals the beginning to a multitude of frustrating problems . Some of these companies claim to be the manufacturer of their products . Buyer beware ! Most companies are simply the "" middlemen "" who sell products that they never actually see for themselves or who will sell factory "" seconds "" . A product may be classified as a second if there is color difference in the yarn used , a flaw or streak in the length of the material , or the backing is defective . Their "" manufactured "" products are not fully inspected for quality . Facts About Nylon Nylon golf greens offer the worst of all possible combinations . They are sold by "" sales people "" , not textile experts . At one time Dupont's nylon 6.6 dominated the sport field market place but was never intended for golf course applications . Except for commercial driving range golf mats , new fiber and infill technologies have virtually eliminated nylon from the sports turf and golf green scene . American Sports & Recreational Surfaces manufactures range mats with SFI monofilament nylon ( SFI is the available source for monofilament nylon in the United States ) . Golf greens using this nylon have "" streak "" lines . If you absolutely have to purchase a nylon golf green demand "" in writing "" that the turf will not have "" streaked "" lines in it . Nylon should be installed over concrete , not nailed down over sand or crushed stone . Nylon with a urethane secondary backing will expand and contract as the ambient temperature changes . This will cause the turf to "" crawl "" on top of the sub-base . Using spikes to hold down the perimeter edges will create bubbles and wrinkles in the turf . You are probably not installing the green for "" goofy golf "" but that is exactly what you will get when the turf bubbles , wrinkles or covers half the cup due to shifting . This is why outdoor nylon turf installations have always been a total direct glue down onto concrete , asphalt . E-Layer or other stabilized substrate . Nylon Golf Greens Will Not Hold A Shot Some companies are still selling nylon turf with an attached expanded urethane foam cushion for outdoor golf greens . These cushions are open cell products that absorb water , retain odors and have a fatigue factor . This will accept short chip shots until your golf green rots or your wife demands it 's removal . If you topdress this nylon turf with the sand these same sales people recommend you will have a nice hard surface to park your boat on . Nylon turf golf greens seem attractive because they are quick to install but the fact is that nylon should be limited to indoor installations where entertainment is the primary objective , rather than a tool to improve your golf game and your home value , if "" streaks "" are not a concern . </doc>

90,A1,"Berlin Declaration on Open Access to Knowledge in the Sciences and Humanities The Internet has fundamentally changed the practical and economic realities of distributing scientific knowledge and cultural heritage . For the first time ever , the Internet now offers the chance to constitute a global and interactive representation of human knowledge , including cultural heritage and the guarantee of worldwide access . We , the undersigned , feel obliged to address the challenges of the Internet as an emerging functional medium for distributing knowledge . Obviously , these developments will be able to significantly modify the nature of scientific publishing as well as the existing system of quality assurance . In accordance with the spirit of the Declaration of the Budapest Open Access Initiative , the ECHO Charter and the Bethesda Statement on Open Access Publishing , we have drafted the Berlin Declaration to promote the Internet as a functional instrument for a global scientific knowledge base and human reflection and to specify measures which research policy makers , research institutions , funding agencies , libraries , archives and museums need to consider . Goals Our mission of disseminating knowledge is only half complete if the information is not made widely and readily available to society . New possibilities of knowledge dissemination not only through the classical form but also and increasingly through the open access paradigm via the Internet have to be supported . We define open access as a comprehensive source of human knowledge and cultural heritage that has been approved by the scientific community . In order to realize the vision of a global and accessible representation of knowledge , the future Web has to be sustainable , interactive , and transparent . Content and software tools must be openly accessible and compatible . Definition of an Open Access Contribution Establishing open access as a worthwhile procedure ideally requires the active commitment of each and every individual producer of scientific knowledge and holder of cultural heritage . Open access contributions include original scientific research results , raw data and metadata , source materials , digital representations of pictorial and graphical materials and scholarly multimedia material . Preface Open access contributions must satisfy two conditions : 1 . The author ( s ) and right holder ( s ) of such contributions grant ( s ) to all users a free , irrevocable , worldwide , right of access to , and a license to copy , use , distribute , transmit and display the work publicly and to make and distribute derivative works , in any digital medium for any responsible purpose , subject to proper attribution of authorship ( community standards , will continue to provide the mechanism for enforcement of proper attribution and responsible use of the published work , as they do now ) , as well as the right to make small numbers of printed copies for their personal use . 2 . A complete version of the work and all supplemental materials , including a copy of the permission as stated above , in an appropriate standard electronic format is deposited ( and thus published ) in at least one online repository using suitable technical standards ( such as the Open Archive definitions ) that is supported and maintained by an academic institution , scholarly society , government agency , or other well established organization that seeks to enable open access , unrestricted distribution , inter operability , and long-term archiving . Supporting the Transition to the Electronic Open Access Paradigm Our organizations are interested in the further promotion of the new open access paradigm to gain the most benefit for science and society . Therefore , we intend to make progress by · encouraging our researchers / grant recipients to publish their work according to the principles of the open access paradigm . · encouraging the holders of cultural heritage to support open access by providing their resources on the Internet . · developing means and ways to evaluate open access contributions and online journals in order to maintain the standards of quality assurance and good scientific practice . · advocating that open access publication be recognized in promotion and tenure evaluation . · advocating the intrinsic merit of contributions to an open access infrastructure by software tool development , content provision , metadata creation , or the publication of individual articles . We realize that the process of moving to open access changes the dissemination of knowledge with respect to legal and financial aspects . Our organizations aim to find solutions that support further development of the existing legal and financial frameworks in order to facilitate optimal use and access . </doc>

445,A8,"Scrap the education white paper Stop all the academies and defend comprehensive education by Ken Muller , assistant secretary Islington NUT ( pc ) Far more is at stake for the future of education than the fate of the hapless Ruth Kelly . New Labour's White Paper on schools signals a thoroughgoing assault on the principle of comprehensive education . The planned education bill based on it would lead to all schools being encouraged to break from local democratic control and turn themselves into semi-independent trusts . Such is the scale of the mounting opposition that the government now appears to fear that it will be able to get the bill through parliament only by relying on Tory votes . Senior New Labour figures said this week that Tony Blair is looking to delay publishing the bill , which was due next month , until he has been able to buy off backbench opposition . Labour backbenchers have already produced an "" alternative White Paper "" . But leading rebels have also said they are prepared to compromise . The city academy programme , which takes schools completely out of public control and hands them over to businessmen , is already law . New Labour's weakness and the rising opposition of parents mean the programme could be derailed . But that will not come by relying on MPs who voted for academies before . A possible compromise being floated over the new bill is that groups of schools could become a trust , rather than individual ones . But what 's so great about a cluster of schools in competition with another group for scarce resources ? Teacher union activists in London have called a protest march over the education proposals for 2 March . Other initiatives are taking place elsewhere across the country . © Copyright Socialist Worker ( unless otherwise stated ) .

314,A8,"Leeds pilot evaluation The programme was established with the aim of evaluating the potential benefits of shared road space in a variety of Home Zones across England and Wales . The Methleys Home Zone is to the north of Leeds City Centre and employed such measures as gateway treatments , Home Zone signing , shared road space , traffic calming and hard and soft landscaping . In order to assess the effectiveness of these measures , a programme of ' before ' and ' after ' monitoring was undertaken . This included household interview surveys with adults and children , collection of traffic flow , speed and accident data , video recording to observe residents behaviour in the shared space , air quality and noise monitoring . The interviews revealed that the majority of resident 's supported the Home Zone scheme and felt it had had a positive impact , whilst half of the adults surveyed thought that motorists were now more considerate to children playing in the street . From the children came a list of the most popular outdoor activities including riding bikes , playing football , chatting and ' hanging around ' with friends . Notably , mean traffic speeds were reduced by 6 mph and traffic flows fell by 10 per cent . The question of on-street car parking spaces and the desire to park close to home to reduce the risk of crime was an area of main concern raised by the residents during the consultation process . On-street parking spaces were reduced by 16 % but generally in areas not directly overlooked by houses . The Home Zone measures had little impact on modal shift or how often people walked , cycled or drove . Similarly , they had little impact on noise levels and kerbside concentrations of benzene and nitrogen oxides . This first evaluation report demonstrates the value of robust monitoring both ' before ' and ' after ' the introduction of Home Zone Schemes and provides quality information for town planners to call upon when considering such schemes in the future .

146,A1,"Well , as Alexander Graham Bell famously said on his first successful telephone call , "" Hello , is that Domino's Pizza ? "" ( Laughter ) I just really want to thank you very much . As another famous man , Jerry Garcia , said , "" What a strange , long trip . "" And he should have said , "" What a strange , long trip it 's about to become . "" At this very moment , you are viewing my upper half . My lower half is appearing at a different conference -- ( Laughter ) in a different country . You can , it turns out , be in two places at once . But still , I 'm sorry I ca n ' t be with you in person . I 'll explain at another time . And though I 'm a rock star , I just want to assure you that none of my wishes will include a hot tub . But what really turns me on about technology is not just the ability to get more songs on mp3 players . The revolution -- this revolution -- is much bigger than that . I hope , I believe . What turns me on about the digital age , what excited me personally , is that you have closed the gap between dreaming and doing . You see , it used to be that if you wanted to make a record of a song , you needed a studio and a producer . Now , you need a laptop . If you wanted to make a film , you needed a mass of equipment and a Hollywood budget . Now , you need a camera that fits in your palm , and a couple of bucks for a blank DVD . Imagination has been decoupled from the old constraints . And that really , really excites me . I 'm excited when I glimpse that kind of thinking writ large . What I would like to see is idealism decoupled from all constraints . Political , economic , psychological , whatever . The geopolitical world has got a lot to learn from the digital world . From the ease with which you swept away obstacles that no one knew could even be budged . And that 's actually what I 'd like to talk about today . First , though , I should probably explain why , and how , I got to this place . It 's a journey that started 20 years ago . You may remember that song , "" We Are the World , "" or , "" Do They Know It 's Christmas ? "" Band Aid , Live Aid . Another very tall , grizzled rock star , my friend Sir Bob Geldof , issued a challenge to "" feed the world . "" It was a great moment , and it utterly changed my life . That summer , my wife , Ali , and myself went to Ethiopia . We went on the quiet to see for ourselves what was going on . We lived in Ethiopia for a month , working at an orphanage . The children had a name for me . They called me , "" The girl with the beard . "" ( Laughter ) Do n't ask . Anyway , we found Africa to be a magical place . Big skies , big hearts , big , shining continent . Beautiful , royal people . Anybody who ever gave anything to Africa got a lot more back . Ethiopia did n't just blow my mind ; it opened my mind . Anyway , on our last day at this orphanage a man handed me his baby and said , "" Would you take my son with you ? "" He knew , in Ireland , that his son would live , and that in Ethiopia , his son would die . It was the middle of that awful famine . Well , I turned him down . And it was a funny kind of sick feeling , but I turned him down . And it 's a feeling I ca n ' t ever quite forget . And in that moment , I started this journey . In that moment , I became the worst thing of all : I became a rock star with a cause . Except this is n't the cause , is it ? Six and a half thousand Africans dying every single day from AIDS -- a preventable , treatable disease -- for lack of drugs we can get in any pharmacy . That 's not a cause . That 's an emergency . 11 million AIDS orphans in Africa , 20 million by the end of the decade . That 's not a cause . That 's an emergency . Today , every day , 9,000 more Africans will catch HIV because of stigmatization and lack of education . That 's not a cause . That 's an emergency . So what we 're talking about here is human rights . The right to live like a human . The right to live , period . And what we 're facing in Africa is an unprecedented threat to human dignity and equality . The next thing I 'd like to be clear about is what this problem is , and what this problem is n't . Because this is not all about charity . This is about justice . Really . This is not about charity . This is about justice . That 's right . And that 's too bad , because we 're very good at charity . Americans , like Irish people , are good at it . Even the poorest neighborhoods give more than they can afford . We like to give , and we give a lot . Look at the response to the tsunami , it 's inspiring . But justice is a tougher standard than charity . You see , Africa makes a fool of our idea of justice . It makes a farce of our idea of equality . It mocks our pieties . It doubts our concern . It questions our commitment . Because there is no way we can look at what 's happening in Africa , and if we 're honest , conclude that it would ever be allowed to happen anywhere else . As you heard in the film , anywhere else , not here . Not here , not in America , not in Europe . In fact , a head of state that you 're all familiar with admitted this to me . And it 's really true . There is no chance this kind of hemorrhaging of human life would be accepted anywhere else other than Africa . Africa is a continent in flames . And deep down , if we really accepted that Africans were equal to us , we would all do more to put the fire out . We 're standing around with watering cans , when what we really need is the fire brigade . You see , it 's not as dramatic as the tsunami . It 's crazy , really , when you think about it . Does stuff have to look like an action movie these days to exist in the front of our brain ? The slow extinguishing of countless lives is just not dramatic enough , it would appear . Catastrophes that we can avert are not as interesting as ones we could avert . Funny , that . Anyway , I believe that that kind of thinking offends the intellectual rigor in this room . Six and a half thousand people dying a day in Africa may be Africa's crisis , but the fact that it 's not on the nightly news , that we in Europe , or you in America , are not treating it like an emergency -- I want to argue with you tonight that that 's our crisis . I want to argue that though Africa is not the front line in the war against terror , it could be soon . Every week , religious extremists take another African village . They 're attempting to bring order to chaos . Well , why are n ' t we ? Poverty breeds despair . We know this . Despair breeds violence . We know this . In turbulent times , is n't it cheaper , and smarter , to make friends out of potential enemies than to defend yourself against them later ? The war against terror is bound up in the war against poverty . And I did n't say that . Colin Powell said that . Now when the military are telling us that this is a war that can not be won by military might alone , maybe we should listen . There 's an opportunity here , and it 's real . It 's not spin . It 's not wishful thinking . The problems facing the developing world afford us in the developed world a chance to re-describe ourselves to the world . We will not only transform other people's lives , but we will also transform the way those other lives see us . And that might be smart in these nervous , dangerous times . Do n't you think that on a purely commercial level , that anti-retroviral drugs are great advertisements for Western ingenuity and technology ? Does n ' t compassion look well on us ? And let 's cut the crap for a second . In certain quarters of the world , brand EU , brand USA , is not at its shiniest . The neon sign is fizzing and cracking . Someone 's put a brick through the window . The regional branch managers are getting nervous . Never before have we in the west been so scrutinized . Our values : do we have any ? Our credibility ? These things are under attack around the world . Brand USA could use some polishing . And I say that as a fan , you know ? As a person who buys the products . But think about it . More anti-retrovirals make sense . But that 's just the easy part , or ought to be . But equality for Africa -- that 's a big , expensive idea . You see , the scale of the suffering numbs us into a kind of indifference . What on earth can we all do about this ? Well , much more than we think . We ca n ' t fix every problem , but the ones we can , I want to argue , we must . And because we can , we must . This is the straight truth , the righteous truth . It is not a theory . The fact is that ours is the first generation that can look disease and extreme poverty in the eye , look across the ocean to Africa , and say this , and mean it . We do not have to stand for this . A whole continent written off -- we do not have to stand for this . ( Applause ) And let me say this without a trace of irony -- before I back it up to a bunch of ex-hippies . Forget the '60s . We can change the world . I ca n ' t , you ca n ' t , as individuals , but we can change the world . I really believe that , the people in this room . Look at the Gates Foundation . They 've done incredible stuff , unbelievable stuff . But working together , we can actually change the world . We can turn the inevitable outcomes , and transform the quality of life for millions of lives who look and feel rather like us , when you 're up close . I 'm sorry to laugh here , but you do look so different than you did in Haight-Ashbury in the '60s . ( Laughter ) But I want to argue that this is the moment that you are designed for . It is the flowering of the seeds you planted in earlier , headier days . Ideas that you gestated in your youth . This is what excites me . This room was born for this moment , is really what I want to say to you tonight . Most of you started out wanting to change the world , did n't you ? Most of you did , the digital world . Well , now , actually because of you , it is possible to change the physical world . It 's a fact . Economists confirm it , and they know much more than I do . So why , then , are we not pumping our fists into the air ? Probably because when we admit we can do something about it , we 've got to do something about it . It is a pain in the arse . This equality business is actually a pain in the arse . But for the first time in history , we have the technology , we have the know-how , we have the cash , we have the life-saving drugs . Do we have the will ? I hope this is obvious , but I 'm not a hippie . And I 'm not really one for the warm , fuzzy feeling . I do not have flowers in my hair . Actually , I come from punk rock . The Clash wore big army boots , not sandals . But I know toughness when I see it . And for all the talk of peace and love on the West Coast , there was muscle to the movement that started out here . You see , idealism detached from action is just a dream . But idealism allied with pragmatism , with rolling up your sleeves and making the world bend a bit , is very exciting . It 's very real . It 's very strong . And it 's very present in a crowd like you . Last year at DATA , this organization I helped set up , we launched a campaign to summon this spirit in the fight against AIDS and extreme poverty . We 're calling it the ONE Campaign . It 's based on our belief that the action of one person can change a lot , but the actions of many coming together as one can change the world . Well , we feel that now is the time to prove we 're right . There are moments in history when civilization redefines itself . We believe this is one . We believe that this could be the time when the world finally decides that the wanton loss of life in Africa is just no longer acceptable . This could be the time that we finally get serious about changing the future for most people who live on planet Earth . Momentum has been building . Lurching a little , but it 's building . This year is a test for us all , especially the leaders of the G8 nations , who really are on the line here , with all the world in history watching . I have been , of late , disappointed with the Bush Administration . They started out with such promise on Africa . They made some really great promises , and actually have fulfilled a lot of them . But some of them they have n ' t . They do n't feel the push from the ground , is the truth . But my disappointment has much more perspective when I talk to American people , and I hear their worries about the deficit , and the fiscal well-being of their country . I understand that . But there 's much more push from the ground than you 'd think , if we got organized . What I try to communicate , and you can help me if you agree , is that aid for Africa is just great value for money at a time when America really needs it . Putting it in the crassest possible terms , the investment reaps huge returns . Not only in lives saved , but in goodwill , stability and security that we 'll gain . So this is what I hope that you will do , if I could be so bold , and not have it deducted from my number of wishes . ( Laughter ) What I hope is that beyond individual merciful acts , that you will tell the politicians to do right by Africa , by America and by the world . Give them permission , if you like , to spend their political capital and your financial capital , your national purse on saving the lives of millions of people . That 's really what I would like you to do . Because we also need your intellectual capital : your ideas , your skills , your ingenuity . And you , at this conference , are in a unique position . Some of the technologies we 've been talking about , you invented them , or at least revolutionized the way that they 're used . Together you have changed the zeitgeist from analog to digital , and pushed the boundaries . And we 'd like you to give us that energy . Give us that kind of dreaming , that kind of doing . As I say , there 're two things on the line here . There 's the continent Africa . But there 's also our sense of ourselves . People are starting to figure this out . Movements are springing up . Artists , politicians , pop stars , priests , CEOs , NGOs , mothers' unions , student unions . A lot of people are getting together , and working under this umbrella I told you about earlier , the ONE Campaign . I think they just have one idea in their mind , which is , where you live in the world , should not determine whether you live in the world . ( Applause ) History , like God , is watching what we do . When the history books get written I think our age will be remembered for three things . Really , it 's just three things this whole age will be remembered for . The digital revolution , yes . The war against terror , yes . And what we did or did not do to put out the fires in Africa . Some say we ca n ' t afford to . I say we ca n ' t afford not to . Thank you , thank you very much . ( Applause ) Okay , my three wishes . The ones that TED has offered to grant . You see , if this is true , and I believe it is , that the digital world you all created has uncoupled the creative imagination from the physical constraints of matter . This should be a piece of piss . ( Laughter ) I should add that this started out as a much longer list of wishes . Most of them impossible , some of them impractical and one or two of them certainly immoral . ( Laughter ) This business , it gets to be addictive , you know what I mean , when somebody else is picking up the tab . Anyway , here 's number one . I wish for you to help build a social movement of more than one million American activists for Africa . That is my first wish . I believe it 's possible . A few minutes ago , I talked about all the citizens' campaigns that are springing up . You know , there 's lots out there . And with this one campaign as our umbrella , my organization , DATA , and other groups , have been tapping into the energy and the enthusiasm that 's out there from Hollywood into the heartland of America . We know there 's more than enough energy to power this movement . We just need your help in making it happen . We want all of you here , church America , corporate America , Microsoft America , Apple America , Coke America , Pepsi America , nerd America , noisy America . We ca n ' t afford to be cool and sit this one out . I do believe if we build a movement that 's one million Americans strong , we 're not going to be denied . We will have the ear of Congress . We 'll be the first page in Condi Rice's briefing book , and right into the Oval Office . If there 's one million Americans -- and I really know this -- who are ready to make phone calls , who are ready to be on email . I am absolutely sure that we can actually change the course of history , literally , for the continent of Africa . Anyway , so I 'd like your help in getting that signed up . I know John Gage and Sun Microsystems are already on board for this , but there 's lots of you we 'd like to talk to . Right , my second wish , number two . I would like one media hit for every person on the planet who is living on less than one dollar a day . That 's one billion media hits . Could be on Google , could be on AOL . Steve Case , Larry , Sergey -- they 've done a lot already . It could be NBC . It could be ABC . Actually we 're talking to ABC today about the Oscars . We have a film , produced by Jon Kamen at Radical Media . But you know , we want , we need some airtime for our ideas . We need to get the math , we need to get the statistics out to the American people . I really believe that old Truman line , that if you give the American people the facts , they 'll do the right thing . And , the other thing that 's important , is that this is not Sally Struthers . This has to be described as an adventure , not a burden . ( Video ) : One by one they step forward , a nurse , a teacher , a homemaker , and lives are saved . The problem is enormous . Every three seconds one person dies . Another three seconds , one more . The situation is so desperate in parts of Africa , Asia , even America that aid groups , just as they did for the tsunami are uniting as one , acting as one . We can beat extreme poverty , starvation , AIDS . But we need your help . One more person , letter , voice will mean the difference between life and death for millions of people . Please join us by working together . Americans have an unprecedented opportunity . We can make history . We can start to make poverty history . One , by one , by one . Please visit ONE at this address . We 're not asking for your money . We 're asking for your voice . Bono : All right . I wish for TED to truly show the power of information . Its power to rewrite the rules and transform lives , by connecting every hospital , health clinic and school in one African country . And I would like it to be Ethiopia . I believe we can connect every school in Ethiopia , every health clinic , every hospital . We can connect to the Internet . That is my wish , my third wish . I think it 's possible . I think we have the money and brains in the room to do that . And that would be a mind-blowing wish to come true . I 've been to Ethiopia , as I said earlier . It 's actually where it all started for me . The idea that the Internet , which changed all of our lives , can transform a country -- and a continent that has hardly made it to analog , let alone digital -- blows my mind . But it did n't start out that way . The first long-distance line from Boston to New York was used in 1885 on the phone . It was just nine years later that Addis Ababa was connected by phone to Harare , which is 500 kilometers away . Since then , not that much has changed . The average waiting time to get a land line in Ethiopia is actually about seven or eight years . But wireless technology was n ' t dreamt up then . Anyway , I 'm Irish , and as you can see , I know how important talking is . Communication is very important for Ethiopia -- will transform the country . Nurses getting better training , pharmacists being able to order supplies , doctors sharing their expertise in all aspects of medicine . It 's a very , very good idea to get them wired . And that is my third and final wish for you at the TED conference . Thank you very much once again . ( Applause ) </content> </doc>

914,A4,"At eight o ' clock I heard a knock at the door , and on opening the window found it was one of the servants from the house of my foes . I cried out to let her in , and I breathed again on hearing that Miss Charpillon had just arrived in a sedan-chair in a pitiable condition , and that she had been put to bed . "" I made haste to come and tell you , "" said the cunning maid , "" not for the sake of your two guineas , but because I saw you were so unhappy . "" This duped me directly . I gave her the two guineas , and made her sit down on my bed , begging her to tell me all about her mistress's return . I did not dream that she had been schooled by my enemies ; but during the whole of this period I was deprived of the right use of my reason . The slut began by saying that her young mistress loved me , and had only deceived me in accordance with her mother's orders . "" I know that , "" I said , "" but where did she pass the night ? "" "" At a shop which she found open , and where she was known from having bought various articles there . She is in bed with a fever , and I am afraid it may have serious consequences as she is in her monthly period . "" "" That 's impossible , for I caught her in the act with her hairdresser . "" "" Oh , that proves nothing ! the poor young man does not look into things very closely . "" "" But she is in love with him . "" "" I do n't think so , though she has spent several hours in his company . "" "" And you say that she loves me ! "" "" Oh , that has nothing to do with it ! It is only a whim of hers with the hairdresser . "" "" Tell her that I am coming to pass the day beside her bed , and bring me her reply . "" "" I will send the other girl if you like . "" "" No , she only speaks English . "" She went away , and as she had not returned by three o ' clock I decided on calling to hear how she was . I knocked at the door , and one of the aunts appeared and begged me not to enter as the two friends of the house were there in a fury against me , and her niece lay in a delirium , crying out "" There 's Seingalt , there 's Seingalt ! He 's going to kill me . Help ! help ! "" "" For God's sake , sir , go away , "" I went home desperate , without the slightest suspicion that it was all a lie . I spent the whole day without eating anything ; I could not swallow a mouthful . All night I kept awake , and though I took several glasses of strong waters I could obtain no rest . At nine o ' clock the next morning I knocked at the Charpillon's door , and the old aunt came and held it half open as before . She forbade me to enter , saying that her niece was still delirious , continually calling on me in her transports , and that the doctor had declared that if the disease continued its course she had not twenty-four hours to live . "" The fright you gave her has arrested her periods ; she is in a terrible state . "" "" O , fatal hairdresser ! "" I exclaimed . "" That was a mere youthful folly ; you should have pretended not to have seen anything . "" "" You think that possible , you old witch , do you ? Do not let her lack for anything ; take that . "" With these words I gave her a bank note for ten guineas and went away , like the fool I was . On my way back I met Goudar , who was quite frightened at my aspect . I begged him to go and see how the Charpillon really was , and then to come and pass the rest of the day with me . An hour after he came back and said he had found them all in tears and that the girl was in extremis . "" Did you see her ? "" "" No , they said she could see no one . "" "" Do you think it is all true ? "" "" I do n't know what to think ; but one of the maids , who tells me the truth as a rule , assured me that she had become mad through her courses being stopped , while she has also a fever and violent convulsions . It is all credible enough , for these are the usual results of a shock when a woman is in such a situation . The girl told me it was all your fault . "" I then told him the whole story . He could only pity me , but when he heard that I had neither eaten nor slept for the last forty-eight hours he said very wisely that if I did not take care I should lose my reason or my life . </doc>

367,A14,"World Usability Day at User Vision User Vision , November 2005 The User Vision office was a hive of activity on November 3rd as over 50 visitors tried to meet the challenges of User Vision's ' Usability Obstacle Course ' . Visitors from a wide variety of companies came to User Vision to learn about usability first hand by trying to meet some of the common usability challenges we face in our modern world . User Vision prepared a series of ' obstacles ' to reveal the design features that can make or break the user experience , and everyone had a chance to see if they could succeed in the tasks such as : Setting the VCR to record a TV programme Buying a product online from a website Changing the ring tone on a mobile phone Transferring a song to an MP3 player - and then playing it Guessing the icon functions on a printer Opening the plastic packaging on a product - without using their teeth ! The epic battle : Man vs. VCR Some of the results are worth noting : Only half the vistors could change the ringtone on a Nokia 6630 mobile phone and most gave it a rating of ' very difficult ' , whilst 92 % could perform the task on a Samsung D500 It took an average of 3.12 minutes to set the VCR ( the slowest was over 6 minutes , and there was notable ( and audible ) exasperation in front of the telly ! Opening the packaging of a plastic wrapped CD took nearly 1 minute on average with the record being set at 9 seconds ( and a few broken nails in the process ! ) In the battle of the MP3 Players , the iPOD won handily over Creative's Zen Micro , although previous familiarity with the popular pod no doubt helped some 9 % were unable to make an e-commerce purchase due to difficulties in using the site - something that many e-retailers should note Less than 60 % of people could figure out what the icons on our printer mean ( that 's why we 've had to stick little labels on them ! ) Printer icons - are these symbols supposed to MEAN something ? Now , there must be ringtones in here somewhere .. Many Eyes on Usability Testing - and Ears on Accessibility The other main event of the afternoon was a rolling programme of usability tests on a variety of sites , including e-government , finance , online travel and e-commerce . On one side of a one-way mirror in User Vision's Usability test lab a test subject worked through tasks and described their impressions to a User Vision consultant , whilst on the other side up to a dozen observers were riveted on their every move and comment . There were some moments of teeth-gnashing frustration from the observers , who thought they could see what would be the most logical next step , which often was not seen by the test subject . The value of usability testing was clearly demonstrated , and the subject's comments and actions clearly showed up some issues in the sites tested . In User Vision's focus group room a demonstration of screen readers used by blind and partially sighted web users was a compelling introduction to web accessibility . Many visitors took the opportunity to ' hear ' their sites as a blind user would , whilst User Vision consultants explained the accessibility features or shortcomings . Certainly the importance of creating accessible sites was highlighted after getting an insight to how many disabled people use the web . Overall , World Usability Day at User Vision proved to be very successful and enjoyable for everyone taking part in the event . Not only did it help to raise awareness of usability but it allowed people to have an understanding of some of the obstacles that consumers and end users have when faced with the task of using an everyday product , software or website .

1092,A14,"Normalizing Flows on Riemannian Manifolds arXiv : 1611 . 02304v1 [ stat . ML ] 7 Nov 2016 Mevlana C. Gemici Google DeepMind mevlana@google.com Danilo J. Rezende Google DeepMind danilor@google.com Shakir Mohamed Google DeepMind shakir@google.com Abstract We consider the problem of density estimation on Riemannian manifolds . Density estimation on manifolds has many applications in fluid-mechanics , optics and plasma physics and it appears often when dealing with angular variables ( such as used in protein folding , robot limbs , gene-expression ) and in general directional statistics . In spite of the multitude of algorithms available for density estimation in the Euclidean spaces Rn that scale to large n ( e.g. normalizing flows , kernel methods and variational approximations ) , most of these methods are not immediately suitable for density estimation in more general Riemannian manifolds . We revisit techniques related to homeomorphisms from differential geometry for projecting densities to sub-manifolds and use it to generalize the idea of normalizing flows to more general Riemannian manifolds . The resulting algorithm is scalable , simple to implement and suitable for use with automatic differentiation . We demonstrate concrete examples of this method on the n-sphere Sn . In recent years , there has been much interest in applying variational inference techniques to learning large scale probabilistic models in various domains , such as images and text [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 ] . One of the main issues in variational inference is finding the best approximation to an intractable posterior distribution of interest by searching through a class of known probability distributions . The class of approximations used is often limited , e.g. , mean-field approximations , implying that no solution is ever able to resemble the true posterior distribution . This is a widely raised objection to variational methods , in that unlike MCMC , the true posterior distribution may not be recovered even in the asymptotic regime . To address this problem , recent work on Normalizing Flows [ 7 ] , Inverse Autoregressive Flows [ 8 ] , and others [ 9 , 10 ] ( referred collectively as normalizing flows ) , focused on developing scalable methods of constructing arbitrarily complex and flexible approximate posteriors from simple distributions using transformations parameterized by neural networks , which gives these models universal approximation capability in the asymptotic regime . In all of these works , the distributions of interest are restricted to be defined over high dimensional Euclidean spaces . There are many other distributions defined over special homeomorphisms of Euclidean spaces that are of interest in statistics , such as Beta and Dirichlet ( n-Simplex ) ; Norm-Truncated Gaussian ( n-Ball ) ; Wrapped Cauchy and Von-Misses Fisher ( n-Sphere ) , which find little applicability in variational inference with large scale probabilistic models due to the limitations related to density complexity and gradient computation [ 11 , 12 , 13 , 14 ] . Many such distributions are unimodal and generating complicated distributions from them would require creating mixture densities or using auxiliary random variables . Mixture methods require further knowledge or tuning , e.g. number of mixture components necessary , and a heavy computational burden on the gradient computation in general , e.g. with quantile functions [ 15 ] . Further , mode complexity increases only linearly with mixtures as opposed to exponential increase with normalizing flows . Conditioning on auxiliary variables [ 16 ] on the other hand constrains the use of the created distribution , due to the need for integrating out the auxiliary factors in certain scenarios . In all of these methods , computation of low-variance gradients is difficult due to the fact that simulation of random variables can not be in general reparameterized ( e.g. rejection sampling [ 17 ] ) . In this work , we present methods that generalizes previous work on improving variational inference in Rn using normalizing flows to Riemannian manifolds of interest such as spheres Sn , tori Tn and their product topologies with Rn , like infinite cylinders . Figure 1 : Left : Construction of a complex density on Sn by first projecting the manifold to Rn , transforming the density and projecting it back to Sn . Right : Illustration of transformed ( S2 → R2 ) densities corresponding to an uniform density on the sphere . Blue : empirical density ( obtained by Monte Carlo ) ; Red : Analytical density from equation ( 4 ) ; Green : Density computed ignoring the intrinsic dimensionality of Sn . These special manifolds M ⊂ Rm are homeomorphic to the Euclidean space Rn where n corresponds to the dimensionality of the tangent space of M at each point . A homeomorphism is a continuous function between topological spaces with a continuous inverse ( bijective and bicontinuous ) . It maps point in one space to the other in a unique and continuous manner . An example manifold is the unit 2-sphere , the surface of a unit ball , which is embedded in R3 and homeomorphic to R2 ( see Figure 1 ) . In normalizing flows , the main result of differential geometry that is used for computing the density updates is given by , d ~ x = | det Jφ | d ~ u and represents the relationship between differentials ( infinitesimal volumes ) between two equidimensional Euclidean spaces using the Jacobian of the function φ : Rn → Rn that transforms one space to the other . This result only applies to transforms that preserve the dimensionality . However , transforms that map an embedded manifold to its intrinsic Euclidean space , do not preserve the dimensionality of the points and the result above become obsolete . Jacobian of such transforms φ : Rn → Rm with m > n are rectangular and an infinitesimal cube on Rn maps to an infinitesimal parallelepiped on the manifold . The relation between these √ volumes is given by d ~ x = det G d ~ u , where G = JφT Jφ is the metric induced by the embedding φ on the tangent space Tx M , [ 18 , 19 , 20 ] . The correct formula for computing the density over M now becomes : Z Z ( f ◦ φ ) ( ~ u ) f ( ~ x ) d ~ x = M ⊂ Rm √ Z ( f ◦ φ ) ( ~ u ) det G d ~ u = Rn Rn q det JφT Jφ d ~ u ( 1 ) The density update going from the manifold to the Euclidian space , ~ x ∈ Sn → ~ u ∈ Rn , is then given by : q q p ( ~ u ) = ( f ◦ φ ) ( ~ u ) det JφT Jφ ( ~ u ) = f ( ~ x ) det JφT Jφ ( φ − 1 ( ~ x )) ( 2 ) As an application of this method on the n-sphere Sn , we introduce Inverse Stereographic Transform and define it as : φ ( u ) : Rn → Sn ⊂ Rn + 1 , 2u / ( uT u + 1 ) ~ x = φ ( ~ u ) = ( 3 ) 1 − 2 / ( uT u + 1 ) which maps Rn to Sn in a bijective and bicontinuous manner . The determinant of the metric G ( x ) associated with this transformation is given by : 2n 2 T ( 4 ) det G = det Jφ ( x ) Jφ ( x ) = xT x + 1 Using these formulae , on the left side of Figure 1 , we map a uniform density on S2 to R2 , enrich this density , using e.g. normalizing flows , and then map it back onto S2 to obtain a multi-modal ( or arbitrarily complex ) density on the original sphere . On qthe right side of Figure 1 , we show that the density update based on the Riemannian metric , i.e. det JφT Jφ ( red ) , is correct and closely follows the kernel density estimate based on 500k samples ( blue ) . We also show that using the generic volume transformation formulation for dimensionality preserving transforms , i.e. | det Jφ | ( green ) , leads to an erroneous density and do not resemble the empirical distributions of samples after the transformation . 2 References [ 1 ] D.

73,A4,"Part 7 Chapter 2 ON Sunday Étienne escaped from the settlement at nightfall . A very clear sky , sprinkled with stars , lit up the earth with the blue haze of twilight . He went down towards the canal , and followed the bank slowly , in the direction of Marchiennes . It was his favourite walk , a grass-covered path two leagues long , passing straight beside this geometrical water-way , which unrolled itself like an endless ingot of molten silver . He never met any one there . But on this day he was vexed to see a man come up to him . Beneath the pale starlight , the two solitary walkers only recognized each other when they were face to face . "" What ! is it you ? "" said Étienne . Souvarine nodded his head without replying . For a moment they remained motionless , then side by side they set out towards Marchiennes . Each of them seemed to be continuing his own reflections , as though they were far away from each other . "" Have you seen in the paper about Pluchart's success at Paris ? "" asked Étienne , at length . "" After that meeting at Belleville , they waited for him on the pavement , and gave him an ovation . Oh ! he 's afloat now , in spite of his sore throat . He can do what he likes in the future . "" The engine-man shrugged his shoulders . He felt contempt for fine talkers , fellows who go into politics as one goes to the bar , to get an income out of phrases . Étienne was now studying Darwin . He had read fragments , summarized and popularized in a five-sou volume ; and out of this ill-understood reading he had gained for himself a revolutionary idea of the struggle for existence , the lean eating the fat , the strong people devouring the pallid middle class . But Souvarine furiously attacked the stupidity of the Socialists who accept Darwin , that apostle of scientific inequality , whose famous selection was only good for aristocratic philosophers . His mate persisted , however , wishing to reason out the matter , and expressing his doubts by an hypothesis : supposing the old society were no longer to exist , swept away to the crumbs ; well , was it not to be feared that the new world would grow up again , slowly spoilt by the same injustices , some sick and others flourishing , some more skilful and intelligent , fattening on everything , and others imbecile and lazy . becoming slaves again ? But before this vision of eternal wretchedness , the engine-man shouted out fiercely that if justice was not possible with man , then man must disappear . For every rotten society there must be a massacre , until the last creature was exterminated . And there was silence again . For a long time , with sunken head , Souvarine walked over the short grass , so absorbed that he kept to the extreme edge , by the water , with the quiet certainty of a sleep-walker on a roof . Then he shuddered causelessly , as though he had stumbled against a shadow . His eyes lifted and his face was very pale ; he said softly to his companion : "" Did I ever tell you how she died ? "" "" Whom do you mean ? "" "" My woman , over there , in Russia . "" Étienne made a vague gesture , astonished at the tremor in his voice and at the sudden desire for confidence in this lad , who was usually so impassive in his stoical detachment from others and from himself . He only knew that the woman was his mistress , and that she had been hanged at Moscow . "" The affair had n ' t gone off , "" Souvarine said , with eyes still vacantly following the white stream of the canal between the bluish colonnades of tall trees . "" We had been a fortnight at the bottom of a hole undermining the railway , and it was not the imperial train that was blown up , it was a passenger train . Then they arrested Annutchka . She brought us bread every evening , disguised as a peasant woman . She lit the fuse , too , because a man might have attracted attention . I followed the trial , hidden in the crowd , for six days . "" His voice became thick , and he coughed as though he were choking . "" Twice I wanted to cry out , and to rush over the people's heads to join her . But what was the good ? One man less would be one soldier less ; and I could see that she was telling me not to come , when her large eyes met mine . "" He coughed again . "" On the last day in the square I was there . It was raining ; they stupidly lost their heads , put out by the falling rain . It took twenty minutes to hang the other four ; the cord broke , they could not finish the fourth . Annutchka was standing up waiting . She could not see me , she was looking for me in the crowd . I got on to a post and she saw me , and our eyes never turned from each other . When she was dead she was still looking at me . I waved my hat ; I came away . "" There was silence again . The white road of the canal unrolled to the far distance , and they both walked with the same quiet step as though each had fallen back into his isolation . At the horizon , the pale water seemed to open the sky with a little hole of light . "" It was our punishment , "" Souvarine went on roughly . "" We were guilty to love each other . Yes , it is well that she is dead ; heroes will be born from her blood , and I no longer have any cowardice at my heart . Ah ! nothing , neither parents , nor wife , nor friend ! Nothing to make my hand tremble on the day when I must take others' lives or give up my own . "" Étienne had stopped , shuddering in the cool night . He discussed no more , he simply said : "" We have gone far ; shall we go back ? "" They went back towards the Voreux slowly , and he added , after a few paces : "" Have you seen the new placards ? "" The Company had that morning put up some more large yellow posters . They were clearer and more conciliatory , and the Company undertook to take back the certificates of those miners who went down on the following day . Everything would be forgotten , and pardon was offered even to those who were most implicated . "" Yes , I 've seen , "" replied the engine-man . "" Well , what do you think of it ? "" "" I think that it 's all up . The flock will go down again . You are all too cowardly . "" Étienne feverishly excused his mates : a man may be brave , a mob which is dying of hunger has no strength . Step by step they were returning to the Voreux ; and before the black mass of the pit he continued swearing that he , at least , would never go down ; but he could forgive those who did . Then , as the rumour ran that the carpenters had not had time to repair the tubbing , he asked for information . Was it true ? Had the weight of the soil against the timber which formed the internal skirt of scaffolding to the shaft so pushed it in that the winding-cages rubbed as they went down for a length of over fifty metres ? Souvarine , who once more became uncommunicative , replied briefly . He had been working the day before , and the cage did , in fact , jar ; the engine-men had even had to double the speed to pass that spot . But all the bosses received any observations with the same irritating remark : it was coal they wanted ; that could be repaired later on . "" You see that is smashing up ! "" Étienne murmured . "" It will be a fine time ! "" With eyes vaguely fixed on the pit in the shadow , Souvarine quietly concluded : "" If it does smash up , the mates will know it , since you advise them to go down again . "" Nine o ' clock struck at the Montsou steeple ; and his companion having said that he was going to bed , he added , without putting out his hand : "" Well , good-bye . I 'm going away . "" "" What ! you 're going away ? "" "" Yes , I 've asked for my certificate back . I 'm going elsewhere . "" Étienne , stupefied and affected , looked at him . After walking for two hours he said that to him ! And in so calm a voice , while the mere announcement of this sudden separation made his own heart ache . They had got to know each other , they had toiled together ; that always makes one sad , the idea of not seeing a person again . "" You 're going away ! And where do you go ? "" "" Over there--I do n't know at all . "" "" But I shall see you again ? "" "" No , I think not . "" They were silent and remained for a moment facing each other without finding anything to say . "" Then good-bye . "" "" Good-bye . "" While Étienne ascended toward the settlement , Souvarine turned and again went along the canal bank ; and there , now alone , he continued to walk , with sunken head , so lost in the darkness that he seemed merely a moving shadow of the night . Now and then he stopped , he counted the hours that struck afar . When he heard midnight strike he left the bank and turned towards the Voreux . At that time the pit was empty , and he only met a sleepy-eyed captain . It was not until two o ' clock that they would begin to get up steam to resume work . First he went to take from a cupboard a jacket which he pretended to have forgotten . Various tools--a drill armed with its screw , a small but very strong saw , a hammer , and a chisel--were rolled up in this jacket . Then he left . But instead of going out through the shed he passed through the narrow corridor which led to the ladder passage . With his jacket under his arm he quietly went down without a lamp , measuring the depth by counting the ladders . He knew that the cage jarred at three hundred and seventy-four metres against the fifth row of the lower tubbing . When he had counted fifty-four ladders he put out his hand and was able to feel the swelling of the planking . It was there . Then , with the skill and coolness of a good workman who has been reflecting over his task for a long time , he set to work . He began by sawing a panel in the brattice so as to communicate with the winding-shaft . With the help of matches , quickly lighted and blown out , he was then able to ascertain the condition of the tubbing and of the recent repairs . Between Calais and Valenciennes the sinking of mine shafts was surrounded by immense difficulties on account of the masses of subterranean water in great sheets at the level of the lowest valleys . Only the construction of tubbings , frameworks jointed like the stays of a barrel , could keep Out the springs which flow in and isolate the shafts in the midst of the lakes , which with deep obscure waves beat against the walls . It had been necessary in sinking the Voreux to establish two tubbings : that of the upper level , in the shifting sands and white clays bordering the chalky stratum , and fissured in every part , swollen with water like a sponge ; then that of the lower level , immediately above the coal stratum , in a yellow sand as fine as flour , flowing with liquid fluidity ; it was here that the Torrent was to be found , that subterranean sea so dreaded in the coal pits of the Nord , a sea with its storms and its shipwrecks , an unknown and unfathomable sea , rolling its dark floods more than three hundred metres beneath the daylight . Usually the tubbings resisted the enormous pressure ; the only thing to be dreaded was the piling up of the neighbouring soil , shaken by the constant movement of the old galleries which were filling up . In this descent of the rocks lines of fracture were sometimes produced which slowly extended as far as the scaffolding , at last perforating it and pushing it into the shaft ; and there was the great danger of a landslip and a flood filling the pit with an avalanche of earth and a deluge of springs . Souvarine , sitting astride in the opening he had made , discovered a very serious defect in the fifth row of tubbing . The wood was bellied out from the framework ; several planks had even come out of their shoulder-pieces . Abundant filtrations , pichoux the miners call them , were jetting out of the joints through the tarred oakum with which they were caulked . The carpenters , pressed for time , had been content to place iron squares at the angles , so carelessly that not all the screws were put in . A considerable movement was evidently going on behind in the sand of the Torrent . Then with his wimble he unscrewed the squares so that another push would tear them all off . It was a foolhardy task , during which he frequently only just escaped from falling headlong down the hundred and eighty metres which separated him from the bottom . He had been obliged to seize the oak guides , the joists along which the cages slid ; and suspended over the void he traversed the length of the cross-beams with which they were joined from point to point , slipping along , sitting down , turning over , simply buttressing himself on an elbow or a knee , with tranquil contempt of death . A breath would have sent him over , and three times he caught himself up without a shudder . First he felt with his hand and then worked , only lighting a match when he lost himself in the midst of these slimy beams . After loosening the screws he attacked the wood itself , and the peril became still greater . He had sought for the key , the piece which held the others ; he attacked it furiously , making holes in it , sawing it , thinning it so that it lost its resistance ; while through the holes and the cracks the water which escaped in small jets blinded him and soaked him in icy rain . Two matches were extinguished . They all be-came damp and then there was night , the bottomless depth of darkness . From this moment he was seized by rage . The breath of the invisible intoxicated him , the black horror of this rain-beaten hole urged him to mad destruction . He wreaked his fury at random against the tubbing , striking where he could with his wimble , with his saw , seized by the desire to bring the whole thing at once down on his head . He brought as much ferocity to the task as though he had been digging a knife into the skin of some execrated living creature . He would kill the Voreux at last , that evil beast with ever-open jaws which had swallowed so much human flesh ! The bite of his tools could be heard , his spine lengthened , he crawled , climbed down , then up again , holding on by a miracle , in continual movement , the flight of a nocturnal bird amid the scaffolding of a belfry . But he grew calm , dissatisfied with himself . Why could not things be done coolly ? Without haste he took breath , and then went back into the ladder passage , stopping up the hole by replacing the panel which he had sawn . That was enough ; he did not wish to raise the alarm by excessive damage which would have been repaired immediately . The beast was wounded in the belly ; we should see if it was still alive at night . And he had left his mark ; the frightened world would know that the beast had not died a natural death . He took his time in methodically rolling up his tools in his jacket , and slowly climbed up the ladders . Then , when he had emerged from the pit without being seen , it did not even occur to him to go and change his clothes . Three o ' clock struck . He remained standing on the road waiting . At the same hour Étienne , who was not asleep , was disturbed by a slight sound in the thick night of the room . He distinguished the low breath of the children , and the snoring of Bonnemort and Maheude ; while Jeanlin near him was breathing with a prolonged flute-like whistle . No doubt he had dreamed , and he was turning back when the noise began again . It was the creaking of a palliasse , the stifled effort of someone who is getting up . Then he imagined that Catherine must be ill . "" I say , is it you ? What is the matter ? "" he asked in a low voice . No one replied , and the snoring of the others continued . For five minutes nothing stirred . Then there was fresh creaking . Feeling certain this time that he was not mistaken , he crossed the room , putting his hands out into the darkness to feel the opposite bed . He was surprised to find the young girl sitting up , holding in her breath , awake and on the watch . "" Well ! why do n't you reply ? What are you doing , then ? "" At last she said : "" I 'm getting up . "" "" Getting up at this hour ? "" "" Yes , I 'm going back to work at the pit . "" Étienne felt deeply moved , and sat down on the edge of the palliasse , while Catherine explained her reasons to him . She suffered too much by living thus in idleness , feeling continual looks of reproach weighing on her ; she would rather run the risk of being knocked about down there by Chaval . And if her mother refused to take her money when she brought it , well ! she was big enough to act for herself and make her own soup . "" Go away ; I want to dress . And do n't say anything , will you , if you want to be kind ? "" But he remained near her ; he had put his arms round her waist in a caress of grief and pity . Pressed one against the other in their shirts , they could feel the warmth of each other 's naked flesh , at the edge of this bed , still moist with the night's sleep . She had at first tried to free herself ; then she began to cry quietly , in her turn taking him by the neck to press him against her in a despairing clasp . And they remained , without any further desires , with the past of their unfortunate love , which they had not been able to satisfy . Was it , then , done with for ever ? Would they never dare to love each other some day , now that they were free ? It only needed a little happiness to dissipate their shame--that awkwardness which prevented them from coming together because of all sorts of ideas which they themselves could not read clearly . "" Go to bed again , "" she whispered . "" I do n't want to light up , it would wake mother . It is time ; leave me . "" He could not hear ; he was pressing her wildly , with a heart drowned in immense sadness . The need for peace , an irresistible need for happiness , was carrying him away ; and he saw himself married , in a neat little house , with no other ambition than to live and to die there , both of them together . He would be satisfied with bread ; and if there were only enough for one , she should have it . What was the good of anything else ? Was there anything in life worth more ? But she was unfolding her naked arms . "" Please , leave me . "" Then , in a sudden impulse , he said in her ear : "" Wait , I 'm coming with you . "" And he was himself surprised at what he had said . He had sworn never to go down again ; whence then came this sudden decision , arising from his lips without thought of his , without even a moment's discussion ? There was now such calm within him , so complete a cure of his doubts , that he persisted like a man saved by chance , who has at last found the only harbour from his torment . So he refused to listen to her when she became alarmed , understanding that he was devoting himself for her and fearing the ill words which would greet him at the pit . He laughed at everything ; the placards promised pardon and that was enough . "" I want to work ; that 's my idea . Let us dress and make no noise . "" They dressed themselves in the darkness , with a thousand precautions . She had secretly prepared her miner's clothes the evening before ; he took a jacket and breeches from the cupboard ; and they did not wash themselves for fear of knocking the bowl . All were asleep , but they had to cross the narrow passage where the mother slept . When they started , as ill luck would have it , they stumbled against a chair . She woke and asked drowsily : "" Eh ! what is it ? "" Catherine had stopped , trembling , and violently pressing Étienne's hand . "" It 's me ; do n't trouble yourself , "" he said . "" I feel stifled and am going outside to breathe a bit . "" "" Very well . "" And Maheude fell asleep again . Catherine dared not stir . At last she went down into the parlour and divided a slice of bread-and-butter which she had reserved from a loaf given by a Montsou lady . Then they softly closed the door and went away . Souvarine had remained standing near the Avantage , at the corner of the road . For half an hour he had been looking at the colliers who were returning to work in the darkness , passing by with the dull tramp of a herd . He was counting them , as a butcher counts his beasts at the entrance to the slaughter-house , and he was surprised at their number ; even his pessimism had not foreseen that the number of cowards would have been so great . The stream continued to pass by , and he grew stiff , very cold , with clenched teeth and bright eyes . But he started . Among the men passing by , whose faces he could not distinguish , he had just recognized one by his walk . He came forward and stopped him . "" Where are you going to ? "" Étienne , in surprise , instead of replying , stammered : "" What ! you 've not set out yet ! "" Then he confessed he was going back to the pit . No doubt he had sworn ; only it could not be called life to wait with folded arms for things which would perhaps happen in a hundred years ; and , besides , reasons of his own had decided him . Souvarine had listened to him , shuddering . He seized him by the shoulder , and pushed him towards the settlement . "" Go home again ; I want you to . Do you understand ? "" But Catherine having approached , he recognized her also . Étienne protested , declaring that he allowed no one to judge his conduct . And the engine-man's eyes went from the young girl to her companion , while he stepped back with a sudden , relinquishing movement . When there was a woman in a man's heart , that man was done for ; he might die . Perhaps he saw again in a rapid vision his mistress hanging over there at Moscow that last link cut from his flesh , which had rendered him free of the lives of others and of his own life . He said simply : "" Go . "" Étienne , feeling awkward , was delaying , and trying to find some friendly word , so as not to separate in this manner . "" Then you 're still going ? "" "" Yes . "" "" Well , give me your hand , old chap . A pleasant journey , and no ill feeling . "" The other stretched out an icy hand . Neither friend nor wife . "" Good-bye for good this time . "" "" Yes , good-bye . "" And Souvarine , standing motionless in the darkness , watched Étienne and Catherine entering the Voreux . </doc>

1169,A1,"HEALTH AND HEALING AT YOUR FINGERTIPS Throw out the bottles and boxes of drugs in your house . A new theory suggests that medicine could be bad for your health , which should at least come as good news to people who can not afford to buy expensive medicine . However , it is a blow to the medicine industry , and an even bigger blow to our confidence in the progress of science . This new theory argues that healing is at our fingertips : we can be healthy by doing Reiki on a regular basis . Supporters of medical treatment argue that medicine should be trusted since it is effective and scientifically proven . They say that there is no need for spiritual methods such as Reiki , Yoga , Tai Chi . These waste our time , something which is quite precious in our material world . There is medicine that can kill our pain , x-rays that show us our fractured bones or MRI that scans our brain for tumors . We must admit that these methods are very effective in the examples that they provide . However , there are some "" every day complaints "" such as back pains , headaches , insomnia , which are treated currently with medicine . When you have a headache , you take an Aspirin , or Vermidon , when you can not sleep , you take Xanax without thinking of the side effects of these . When you use these pills for a long period , you become addicted to them ; you can not sleep without them . We pay huge amounts of money and become addicted instead of getting better . How about a safer and more economical way of healing ? When doing Reiki to yourself , you do not need anything except your energy so it is very economical . As for its history , it was discovered in Japan in the early 1900s and its popularity has spread particularly throughout America and Western Europe . In quantum physics , energy is recognized as the fundamental substance of which the universe is composed . Reiki depends on the energy within our bodies . It is a simple and effective way of restoring the energy flow . There are no side effects and it is scientifically explained . Opponents of alternative healing methods also claim that serious illnesses such as HIV / AIDS and cancer can not be treated without drugs . They think so because these patients spend the rest of their lives in the hospital taking medicine . How can Reiki make these people healthy again ? It is very unfortunate that these patients have to live in the hospital losing their hair because of chemotherapy , losing weight because of the side effects of the medicine they take . Actually , it is common knowledge that except for when the cancer is diagnosed at an early stage , drugs also can not treat AIDS or cancer . Most of the medicine these patients use are to ease their pain and their sufferings because of the medical treatment they undergo . Instead of drugs which are expensive and have many side effects , you can use your energy to overcome the hardships of life , find an emotional balance , leave the stress of everyday life and let go of the everyday worries . Most of the chronic conditions such as eczema or migraine are known to have causes such as poor diet and stress . Deep-rooted anger or other strong emotions can contribute to viral infections as well . Since balancing our emotions and controlling our thoughts are very important for our well-being , we should definitely start learning Reiki and avoid illnesses before it is too late . Some people may still maintain that in our material world , everything depends on time . It is even "" lacking time "" that causes much of the stress that leads to the illnesses we mentioned . How would it be possible to find time to do Reiki to ourselves and the people around us when we can not even find time to go to the theater ? This is one good thing about Reiki ; it does not require more than 15 minutes of our time . There is no need for changing clothes or special equipment . It is a wonderfully simple healing art , an effective method of relaxation and stress-relief . Most important of all , it is less time consuming than medicine if we think of all the time we spend taking medicine for some complaints and taking some more for the side effects as well . Having said these , resistance to Reiki would be quite illogical . Reiki is natural and drug-free . What is more , it is easy to learn by anyone , regardless of age and experience . It can be used anywhere , anytime . It also enhances physical , mental , emotional and spiritual well-being and the benefits last a lifetime . It is definitely high time to get away from the drug boxes we store in our drug cabinet ! </doc>

100,A11,"This is a representation of your brain . And your brain can be broken into two parts . There 's the left half , which is the logical side , and then the right half , which is the intuitive . And so if we had a scale to measure the aptitude of each hemisphere , then we can plot our brain . And for example , this would be somebody who 's completely logical . This would be someone who 's entirely intuitive . So where would you put your brain on this scale ? Some of us may have opted for one of these extremes , but I think for most people in the audience , your brain is something like this -- with a high aptitude in both hemispheres at the same time . It 's not like they 're mutually exclusive or anything . You can be logical and intuitive . And so I consider myself one of these people , along with most of the other experimental quantum physicists , who need a good deal of logic to string together these complex ideas . But at the same time , we need a good deal of intuition to actually make the experiments work . How do we develop this intuition ? Well we like to play with stuff . So we go out and play with it , and then we see how it acts . And then we develop our intuition from there . And really you do the same thing . So some intuition that you may have developed over the years is that one thing is only in one place at a time . I mean , it can sound weird to think about one thing being in two different places at the same time , but you were n ' t born with this notion , you developed it . And I remember watching a kid playing on a car stop . He was just a toddler and he was n ' t very good at it , and he kept falling over . But I bet playing with this car stop taught him a really valuable lesson , and that 's that large things do n't let you get right past them , and that they stay in one place . And so this is a great conceptual model to have of the world , unless you 're a particle physicist . It 'd be a terrible model for a particle physicist , because they do n't play with car stops , they play with these little weird particles . And when they play with their particles , they find they do all sorts of really weird things -- like they can fly right through walls , or they can be in two different places at the same time . And so they wrote down all these observations , and they called it the theory of quantum mechanics . And so that 's where physics was at a few years ago ; you needed quantum mechanics to describe little , tiny particles . But you did n't need it to describe the large , everyday objects around us . This did n't really sit well with my intuition , and maybe it 's just because I do n't play with particles very often . Well , I play with them sometimes , but not very often . And I 've never seen them . I mean , nobody 's ever seen a particle . But it did n't sit well with my logical side either . Because if everything is made up of little particles and all the little particles follow quantum mechanics , then should n ' t everything just follow quantum mechanics ? I do n't see any reason why it should n ' t . And so I 'd feel a lot better about the whole thing if we could somehow show that an everyday object also follows quantum mechanics . So a few years ago , I set off to do just that . So I made one . This is the first object that you can see that has been in a mechanical quantum superposition . So what we 're looking at here is a tiny computer chip . And you can sort of see this green dot right in the middle . And that 's this piece of metal I 'm going to be talking about in a minute . This is a photograph of the object . And here I 'll zoom-in a little bit . We 're looking right there in the center . And then here 's a really , really big close-up of the little piece of metal . So what we 're looking at is a little chunk of metal , and it 's shaped like a diving board , and it 's sticking out over a ledge . And so I made this thing in nearly the same way as you make a computer chip . I went into a clean room with a fresh silicon wafer , and then I just cranked away at all the big machines for about 100 hours . For the last stuff , I had to build my own machine -- to make this swimming pool-shaped hole underneath the device . This device has the ability to be in a quantum superposition , but it needs a little help to do it . Here , let me give you an analogy . You know how uncomfortable it is to be in a crowded elevator ? I mean , when I 'm in an elevator all alone , I do all sorts of weird things , but then other people get on board and I stop doing those things , because I do n't want to bother them , or , frankly , scare them . So quantum mechanics says that inanimate objects feel the same way . The fellow passengers for inanimate objects are not just people , but it 's also the light shining on it and the wind blowing past it and the heat of the room . And so we knew , if we wanted to see this piece of metal behave quantum mechanically , we 're going to have to kick out all the other passengers . And so that 's what we did . We turned off the lights , and then we put it in a vacuum and sucked out all the air , and then we cooled it down to just a fraction of a degree above absolute zero . Now , all alone in the elevator , the little chunk of metal is free to act however it wanted . And so we measured its motion . We found it was moving in really weird ways . Instead of just sitting perfectly still , it was vibrating . And the way it was vibrating was breathing something like this -- like expanding and contracting bellows . And by giving it a gentle nudge , we were able to make it both vibrate and not vibrate at the same time -- something that 's only allowed with quantum mechanics . So what I 'm telling you here is something truly fantastic . What does it mean for one thing to be both vibrating and not vibrating at the same time ? So let 's think about the atoms . So one case : all the trillions of atoms that make up that chunk of metal are sitting still and at the same time those same atoms are moving up and down . Now it 's only at precise times when they align . The rest of the time they 're delocalized . That means that every atom is in two different places at the same time , which in turn means the entire chunk of metal is in two different places . I think this is really cool . ( Laughter ) Really . ( Applause ) It was worth locking myself in a clean room to do this for all those years . Because , check this out , the difference in scale between a single atom and that chunk of metal is about the same as the difference between that chunk of metal and you . So if a single atom can be in two different places at the same time , that chunk of metal can be in two different places , then why not you ? I mean , this is just my logical side talking . So imagine if you 're in multiple places at the same time , what would that be like ? How would your consciousness handle your body being delocalized in space ? There 's one more part to the story . It 's when we warmed it up , and we turned on the lights and looked inside the box , we saw that the piece metal was still there in one piece . And so I had to develop this new intuition , that it seems like all the objects in the elevator are really just quantum objects just crammed into a tiny space . You hear a lot of talk about how quantum mechanics says that everything is all interconnected . Well , that 's not quite right ; it 's more than that , it 's deeper . It 's that those connections , your connections to all the things around you , literally define who you are . And that 's the profound weirdness of quantum mechanics . Thank you .

1602,A1,"All that is necessary when playing Perudo , the Inca dice pastime , is five dice per player and an opaque dice cup . The simplicity of the Perudo equipment reflects the minimalist nature of the game where the most important element is the audacity of the players . However , a Perudo set of dice and cup can be quite attractive depending on the taste and preference of the player . Professional players agree that a good Perudo set of dice is made out of five precision dice , but then again many of them also claim to be able to tell the difference between the faces of a dice just by the sound it makes within the cup when slammed on the table . Although not directly related in origin to the Inca dice pastime , precision dice where added as part of the Perudo equipment at the beginning of the XX century when this kind of dice were introduced at casino tables worldwide . When it comes down to the cups in a Perudo set , an actual dice dup like we are use to is not always what it is used . In some places , it is customary to use an empty box , some glasses , hollowed containers or even a hand as the Perudo equipment utilized for shaking , slamming , and covering the dice . On the other hand , especially handmade valuable leather cups are also seen frequently on the tables of this ancient Inca diversion . It is also possible to play Perudo , online poker , and other online casino favorites over the Internet . </doc>

1484,A7,"Featured eBooks Young and in Debt Should You Get A Pre-Nuptial Agreement ? Prenuptial agreements are not romantic , but they are a practical way to establish how money and property will be divided in the event of a divorce . The first rule of thumb with a pre-nuptial agreement is to remember that it is simply a financial contract , not a romantic statement . Your desire to have a prenuptial agreement may be related to how many assets you have going into your marriage . Let's look at a few scenarios . Meet Cindy and Joe , engaged in their 30s . Cindy bought a townhome in her 20s with a $ 10 , 000 down payment . The townhouse has since appreciated by approximately $ 30 , 000 . Joe has always rented . Cindy and Joe plan to remain in the townhome for at least the first few years of their marriage . Cindy would like to protect the investment that she made in her 20s , should she and John divorce . John is concerned as well . He has been helping with the monthly mortgage payment and will continue to do so after they are married . How can both of their financial interests be protected by a prenuptial agreement ? Cindy and Joe meet with an attorney who proposes a solution . The prenuptial agreement states that Cindy enters the marriage with $ 40 , 000 invested in the townhome , which is not to be shared by John should they divorce . Appreciation and equity added after the wedding will be split equally , in the case of divorce . Cindy should not feel selfish for protecting her investment . This is money that she earned over many years , through hard work and savvy investing before she met John . Meet Anna and Juan . Anna is in her 20s and Juan is in his 30s . Neither own a home or have large bank accounts . Juan has worked at the same company for 15 years and has already built up a sizeable pension . Juan would like to hold back his pension from Anna , in the case of divorce . Both Juan and Anna plan for her to be a stay-at-home mom after their first child is born . Anna is concerned that she will not be contributing to her own pension in this scenario , and wants protection from being excluded from Juan's pension . The prenuptial agreement drafted by their attorneys states that Cindy is entitled to claim half of the portion of Juan's pension that accumulates after they marry . Put your kids first ! Prenuptial agreements are especially important if you have children . Do n't jeopardize your kids' college fund , home and / or future by marrying without a prenuptial agreement . In the event of a death and / or divorce , your kids could be big losers if you do n't plan ahead . Seek pre-nuptial and financial counseling before walking down the aisle . The best place to iron out your financial concerns is with a neutral third party . Get your own lawyer . A pre-nuptial agreement should not cost more than a few hundred dollars per person ( unless you have significant assets ) . You should have your own lawyer representing your needs . Prenuptial agreements are about self-respect and being fair . They are also a good vehicle to see how your fiancé reacts to "" what if "" financial scenarios . If you do n't like what you see , be careful about moving ahead with the marriage . If you or your fiancé have major debt , consider discussing how that debt will be managed and / or eliminated during the marriage . Establish financial priorities that you can both agree on , from the beginning . Order his and hers credit reports and crunch the numbers before all the wedding bills start piling up . Do not run out an open joint credit right after marriage . </doc>

708,A1,"The Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament has condemned tomorrow 's scheduled "" sub-critical "" test of nuclear weapon components at the Nevada Test Site . The test , a joint venture of Britain's Atomic Weapons Establishment and the USA's Los Alamos National Laboratory , will provide data for the US nuclear weapons programmes . The data collected from this test can be used both to verify existing weapons and also to model new warheads . The UK is currently considering replacing its Trident nuclear weapon system , due to expire in 2024 , with a new generation of nuclear weapons . Kate Hudson , Chair of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament , said , "" At a time when the US , UK , and others claim to be trying to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons , they themselves are conducting tests designed to possibly build more nuclear weapons . By engaging in this nuclear test , the US and UK are demonstrating to the world that they are not truly committed to achieving nuclear disarmament . "" The US and UK are jointly conducting this test under the 1958 Mutual Defence Agreement ( MDA ) , which has among its goals to improve each party's "" atomic weapon design , development , and fabrication capability "" ( note 3 ) . Ms Hudson said , "" Our government must immediately stop engaging in these nuclear tests , which contravene the spirit of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty . Not only do such tests threaten to cause massive environmental damage , they also make the world a more dangerous place by paving the way for a new generation of nuclear weapons . "" </doc>

1320,A7,"More Stories by Green Bride Guide Hawaiian-themed weddings can quickly turn from trendy to tacky without proper planning . If you 're looking for more substantial and traditional elements than simply leis and Hawaiian shirts on your wedding day , try these culture-infused ceremony and reception tips . Traditional Hawaiian wedding ceremonies begin with a warm welcoming chant , or "" mele , "" performed by a local minister . The chant , appropriately named "" Oli Aloha , "" meaning happiness , love and respect , overflows with passionate and appreciative lyrics for the soon to be newlyweds . "" Oli Aloha "" Fragrant with hala and lehua A house of leua for the mist It is mine to cherish Longing for your arrival For when you come Love comes with you In native Hawaiian culture , the environment plays an extremely important role in people's everyday lives . The significance and use of flowers , particularly during a wedding , is essential . Native Hawaiian flowers bring fragrant and vibrant elements to the wedding ceremony . Supplying your wedding with local and indigenous flowers , instead of flying them in from the mainland United States , can help you keep your wedding eco-friendly . Indigenous plants such as the deep red and yellow red tower ginger , or tie-dye-esque purple bamboo orchid , provide unique and distinctly Hawaiian decoration to the venue . Upon the bride's arrival , before her procession down the aisle to meet her groom , a member of the bridal party carries out the "" Blowing of the Conch Shell , "" or "" pu . "" This tradition marks the actual beginning of the ceremony . He or she will blow quite loudly into the colorful swirl-shaped shell , allowing the bride's presence to be known and to pay tribute to the four elements of life : earth , sea , air and fire . The earth and all things that grow are spiritual and integral parts of Hawaiian culture . This part of the ceremony pays tribute to just that . Hawaiian brides traditionally wear loose fitting , floor length dresses for the ceremony and word "" muumuu "" has been thrown around when referring to these outfits . However , consider a more flattering and trendy dress that you can wear again after easy alternations . Leis are a vital part of all Hawaiian celebrations . The necklaces typically contain 40-50 brightly colored flowers that , when strung together , create a kaleidoscope of color and symbolize love and respect , the very essence of "" aloha . "" The couple may elect to start the ceremony by wearing each other 's leis and then switch . Further , at the end of the ceremony they may choose to throw their leis into the ocean . It is believed they will be carried out by the tide and reach deceased family members , who will return them as gesture of "" aloha . "" If you are planning a beach reception as well as ceremony , it is essential to have appropriate lighting after the sun goes down . Because of the wind , candles are easily blown out and lighting becomes a problem . Hiring a Hawaiian Torchbearer instead of using candles is a great way to add yet another ecofriendly element and cut costs for your traditional Hawaiian wedding . </doc>

906,A4,"She dropped it into the flame . For a while , she stood with her back to Henry , leaning on the mantel-piece , and looking into the fire . He took the chair to which she had pointed , with a strange contradiction of expression in his face : the tears were in his eyes , while the brows above were knit close in an angry frown . He muttered to himself , ' Damn him ! ' She rallied her courage , and looked at him again when she spoke . ' Well , Henry , and why are you going away ? ' ' I am out of spirits , Agnes , and I want a change . ' She paused before she spoke again . His face told her plainly that he was thinking of her when he made that reply . She was grateful to him , but her mind was not with him : her mind was still with the man who had deserted her . She turned round again to the fire . ' Is it true , ' she asked , after a long silence , ' that they have been married to-day ? ' He answered ungraciously in the one necessary word : -- ' Yes . ' ' Did you go to the church ? ' He resented the question with an expression of indignant surprise . ' Go to the church ? ' he repeated . ' I would as soon go to -- ' He checked himself there . ' How can you ask ? ' he added in lower tones . ' I have never spoken to Montbarry , I have not even seen him , since he treated you like the scoundrel and the fool that he is . ' She looked at him suddenly , without saying a word . He understood her , and begged her pardon . But he was still angry . ' The reckoning comes to some men , ' he said , ' even in this world . He will live to rue the day when he married that woman ! ' Agnes took a chair by his side , and looked at him with a gentle surprise . ' Is it quite reasonable to be so angry with her , because your brother preferred her to me ? ' she asked . Henry turned on her sharply . ' Do you defend the Countess , of all the people in the world ? ' ' Why not ? ' Agnes answered . ' I know nothing against her . On the only occasion when we met , she appeared to be a singularly timid , nervous person , looking dreadfully ill ; and being indeed so ill that she fainted under the heat of my room . Why should we not do her justice ? We know that she was innocent of any intention to wrong me ; we know that she was not aware of my engagement -- ' Henry lifted his hand impatiently , and stopped her . ' There is such a thing as being too just and too forgiving ! ' he interposed . ' I ca n't bear to hear you talk in that patient way , after the scandalously cruel manner in which you have been treated . Try to forget them both , Agnes . I wish to God I could help you to do it ! ' Agnes laid her hand on his arm . ' You are very good to me , Henry ; but you do n't quite understand me . I was thinking of myself and my trouble in quite a different way , when you came in . I was wondering whether anything which has so entirely filled my heart , and so absorbed all that is best and truest in me , as my feeling for your brother , can really pass away as if it had never existed . I have destroyed the last visible things that remind me of him . In this world I shall see him no more . But is the tie that once bound us , completely broken ? Am I as entirely parted from the good and evil fortune of his life as if we had never met and never loved ? What do you think , Henry ? I can hardly believe it . ' ' If you could bring the retribution on him that he has deserved , ' Henry Westwick answered sternly , ' I might be inclined to agree with you . ' As that reply passed his lips , the old nurse appeared again at the door , announcing another visitor . </doc>

1614,A12,"Promotions for news / opinion / discussion web sites , or other secondary sources of public information Organizations able to fund radio marketing campaigns are respectfully requested to use underwriting sponsorships rather than soliciting PSA slots . WTUL targets PSAs towards organizations not otherwise able to promote their service efforts . Please contact us to discuss including WTUL in your media strategy . For dated material , please allow at least two weeks' notice , and preferably a month . Our announcement roster is usually prepared weekly , and sometimes earlier ; we regret that we do not revise schedules once published for late notices . We avoid opening attachments --- we 've had bad experiences with viruses in the past . And it 's much easier for us to copy / paste text into our rotations without all the formatting in attachments . Currently , all of our PSAs are read by the on-air DJ ; we are not currently airing pre-recorded spots . Please include at least one form of public contact information in your PSA text : an email address , a phone number and / or a web page URL . Our standard form for the last sentence is : "" More information is available by calling ... , by email to ... , or online at ... "" . PSAs are 50-60 spoken words at the very most , and normally shorter . Note that URLs , phone numbers and email addresses include several spoken words , even though they are written as a single word . Please use standard spellings : PSAs will read and not viewed ; trademarks or other vanity spellings can not be reproduced on the radio . Please send ready-to-air copy as a short paragraph of complete sentences . We receive too many submissions to take the time to rewrite lengthy ones , or to re-write text that would sound senseless when read aloud , so please do not ask us to "" just shape this up "" or "" just edit this down to size "" . Press releases are normally much , much longer than what we run as PSAs . Again , we can not offer to whittle down paragraphs of material into an appropriate announcement , and it 's often a significant bit of work to figure out the most important parts . So please send us text of suitable length . Flyers are also not a good thing to send for PSAs : flyers are a visual medium , not for reading aloud . PSAs should be a short paragraph , but flyers are usually just headlines and bullet points . Again , we can not offer to rewrite everyone's flyers into a regular paragraph , so please send us ready-to-read text . Information contained in material submitted to WTUL for distribution as PSAs or other on-air content must be unencumbered by copyright or other intellectual property claims . Restricted material , or material of ambiguous status , can not be aired . PSAs are scheduled by rotation ; a spot's frequency depends on the number of other spots in the rotation , and its scheduling varies randomly . Generally , short-term spots with a close deadline will be aired more frequently than less-timely and longer-term material . Because PSAs are a free service , we do not offer scheduling to specific times , wording guarantees , or scheduling records ; groups interested in these services are encouraged to inquire about Sponsorship Underwriting , through which we schedule more tailored announcements in consultation with donors . Phrase PSAs as providing information about opportunities , not as demanding action --- that is , the PSA should use declarative sentences ( like "" We need help . "" ) , not directions ( "" Help us now . "" ) or rhetorical questions ( "" Would you help this clearly in-need group ? "" ) . </doc>

169,A14,"Today I 'm going to talk to you about the problem of other minds . And the problem I 'm going to talk about is not the familiar one from philosophy , which is , "" How can we know whether other people have minds ? "" That is , maybe you have a mind , and everyone else is just a really convincing robot . So that 's a problem in philosophy . But for today's purposes I 'm going to assume that many people in this audience have a mind , and that I do n't have to worry about this . There is a second problem that is maybe even more familiar to us as parents and teachers and spouses , and novelists . Which is , "" Why is it so hard to know what somebody else wants or believes ? "" Or perhaps , more relevantly , "" Why is it so hard to change what somebody else wants or believes ? "" I think novelists put this best . Like Philip Roth , who said , "" And yet , what are we to do about this terribly significant business of other people ? So ill equipped are we all , to envision one another 's interior workings and invisible aims . "" So as a teacher , and as a spouse , this is , of course , a problem I confront every day . But as a scientist , I 'm interested in a different problem of other minds , and that is the one I 'm going to introduce to you today . And that problem is , "" How is it so easy to know other minds ? "" So to start with an illustration , you need almost no information , one snapshot of a stranger , to guess what this woman is thinking , or what this man is . And put another way , the crux of the problem is the machine that we use for thinking about other minds , our brain , is made up of pieces , brain cells , that we share with all other animals , with monkeys , and mice , and even sea slugs . And yet , you put them together in a particular network , and what you get is the capacity to write Romeo and Juliet . Or to say , as Alan Greenspan did , "" I know you think you understand what you thought I said , but I 'm not sure you realize that what you heard is not what I meant . "" ( Laughter ) So the job of my field of cognitive neuroscience is to stand with these ideas , one in each hand . And to try to understand how you can put together simple units , simple messages over space and time , in a network , and get this amazing human capacity to think about minds . So I 'm going to tell you three things about this today . Obviously the whole project here is huge . And I 'm going to tell you just our first few steps about the discovery of a special brain region for thinking about other people's thoughts . Some observations on the slow development of this system as we learn how to do this difficult job . And then finally , to show that some of the differences between people , in how we judge others , can be explained by differences in this brain system . So first , the first thing I want to tell you is that there is a brain region in the human brain , in your brains , whose job it is to think about other people's thoughts . This is a picture of it . It 's called the Right Temporo-Parietal Junction . It 's above and behind your right ear . And this is the brain region you used when you saw the pictures I showed you , or when you read Romeo and Juliet , or when you tried to understand Alan Greenspan . And you do n't use it for solving any other kinds of logical problems . So this brain region is called the RTPJ . And this picture shows the average activation in a group of what we call typical human adults . They 're MIT undergraduates . ( Laughter ) The second thing I want to say about this brain system is that although we human adults are really good at understanding other minds , we were n ' t always that way . It takes children a long time to break into the system . I 'm going to show you a little bit of that long , extended process . The first thing I 'm going to show you is a change between age three and five , as kids learn to understand that somebody else can have beliefs that are different from their own . So I 'm going to show you a five-year-old who is getting a standard kind of puzzle that we call the false belief task . Video : This is the first pirate . His name is Ivan . And you know what pirates really like ? Pirates really like cheese sandwiches . Child : Cheese ? I love cheese ! R. S. : Yeah . So Ivan has this cheese sandwich . and he says "" Yum yum yum yum yum ! I really love cheese sandwiches . "" And Ivan puts his sandwich over here , on top of the pirate chest . And Ivan says , "" You know what ? I need a drink with my lunch . "" And so Ivan goes to get a drink . And while Ivan is away the wind comes , and it blows the sandwich down onto the grass . And now , here comes the other pirate . This pirate is called Joshua . And Joshua also really loves cheese sandwiches . So Joshua has a cheese sandwich and he says , "" Yum yum yum yum yum ! I love cheese sandwiches . "" And he puts his cheese sandwich over here on top of the pirate chest . Child : So , that one is his . R. S. : That one is Joshua's . That 's right . Child : And then his went on the ground . R. S. : That 's exactly right . Child : So he wo n ' t know which one is his . R. S. : Oh . So now Joshua goes off to get a drink . Ivan comes back and he says , "" I want my cheese sandwich . "" So which one do you think Ivan is going to take ? Child : I think he is going to take that one . R. S. : Yeah , you think he 's going to take that one ? Alright . Let 's see . Oh yeah , you were right . He took that one . So that 's a five-year-old who clearly understands that other people can have false beliefs and what the consequences are for their actions . Now I 'm going to show you a three-year-old who got the same puzzle . Video : R. S. : And Ivan says , "" I want my cheese sandwich . "" Which sandwich is he going to take ? Do you think he 's going to take that one ? Let 's see what happens . Let 's see what he does . Here comes Ivan . And he says , "" I want my cheese sandwich . "" And he takes this one . Uh-oh . Why did he take that one ? Child : His was on the grass . R. S. So the three-year-old does two things differently . First he predicts Ivan will take the sandwich that 's really his . And second , when he sees Ivan taking the sandwich where he left his , where we would say he 's taking that one because he thinks it 's his , the three-year-old comes up with another explanation . He 's not taking his own sandwich because he does n ' t want it , because now it 's dirty , on the ground . So that 's why he 's taking the other sandwich . Now of course , development does n ' t end at five . And we can see the continuation of this process of learning to think about other people's thoughts by upping the ante and asking children now , not for an action prediction , but for a moral judgement . So first I 'm going to show you the three-year-old again . Video : R. S. : So is Ivan being mean and naughty for taking Joshua's sandwich ? Child : Yeah . R. S. : Should Ivan get in trouble for taking Joshua's sandwich ? Child : Yeah . R. S. : So it 's maybe not surprising he thinks it was mean of Ivan to take Joshua's sandwich . Since he thinks Ivan only took Joshua's sandwich to avoid having to eat his own dirty sandwich . But now I 'm going to show you the five-year-old . Remember the five-year-old completely understood why Ivan took Joshua's sandwich . Video : R. S. : Was Ivan being mean and naughty for taking Joshua's sandwich ? Child : Um , yeah . R. S. : And so , it is not until age seven that we get what looks more like an adult response . Video : R. S. : Should Ivan get in trouble for taking Joshua's sandwich ? Child : No , because the wind should get in trouble . R. S. He says the wind should get in trouble for switching the sandwiches . ( Laughter ) And now what we 've started to do in my lab is to put children into the brain scanner and ask what 's going on in their brain as they develop this ability to think about other people's thoughts . So the first thing is that in children we see this same brain region , the RTPJ , being used while children are thinking about other people . But it 's not quite like the adult brain . So where as in the adults , as I told you , this brain region is almost completely specialized . It does almost nothing else , except for thinking about other people's thoughts . In children it 's much less so , when they are age five to eight , the age range of the children I just showed you . And actually if we even look at eight to 11-year-olds , getting into early adolescence , they still do n't have quite an adult-like brain region . And so , what we can see is that over the course of childhood and even into adolescence , both the cognitive system , our mind's ability to think about other minds , and the brain system that supports it , are continuing , slowly , to develop . But of course , as you 're probably aware , even in adulthood , people differ from one another in how good they are at thinking of other minds , how often they do it , and how accurately . And so what we wanted to know was , could differences among adults , in how they think about other people's thoughts be explained in terms of differences in this brain region . So the first thing that we did is we gave adults a version of the pirate problem that we gave to the kids . And I 'm going to give that to you now . So Grace and her friend are on a tour of a chemical factory and they take a break for coffee . And Grace's friend asks for some sugar in her coffee . Grace goes to make the coffee and finds by the coffee a pot containing a white powder , which is sugar . But the powder is labeled "" Deadly Poison "" . So Grace thinks that the powder is a deadly poison . And she puts it in her friend's coffee . And her friend drinks the coffee , and is fine . How many people think it was morally permissible for Grace to put the powder in the coffee ? Okay . Good . ( Laughter ) So we ask people how much should Grace be blamed in this case , which we call a failed attempt to harm . And we can compare that to another case where everything in the real world is the same . The powder is still sugar , but what 's different is what Grace thinks . Now she thinks the powder is sugar . And perhaps unsurprisingly , if Grace thinks the powder is sugar and puts it in her friend's coffee , people say she deserves no blame at all . Whereas if she thinks the powder was poison , even though it 's really sugar , now people say she deserves a lot of blame , even though what happened in the real world was exactly the same . And in fact they say she deserves more blame in this case , the failed attempt to harm , than in another case , which we call an accident . Where Grace thought the powder was sugar , because it was labeled "" sugar "" and by the coffee machine , but actually the powder was poison . So even though when the powder was poison , the friend drank the coffee and died , people say Grace deserves less blame in that case , when she innocently thought it was sugar , than in the other case , where she thought it was poison , and no harm occurred . People , though , disagree a little bit about exactly how much blame Grace should get in the accident case . Some people think she should deserve more blame , and other people less . And what I 'm going to show you is what happened when we look inside the brains of people while they 're making that judgment . So what I 'm showing you , from left to right , is how much activity there was in this brain region . and from top to bottom , how much blame people said that Grace deserved . And what you can see is , on the left when there as very little activity in this brain region , people paid little attention to her innocent belief and said she deserved a lot of blame for the accident . Whereas , on the right , where there was a lot of activity , people payed a lot more attention to her innocent belief , and said she deserved a lot less blame for causing the accident . So that 's good , but of course what we 'd rather is have a way to interfere with function in this brain region , and see if we could change people's moral judgment . And we do have such a tool . It 's called Trans-Cranial Magnetic Stimulation , or TMS . This is a tool that lets us pass a magnetic pulse through somebody's skull , into a small region of their brain , and temporarily disorganize the function of the neurons in that region . So I 'm going to show you a demo of this . First I 'm going to show you , to show you that this is a magnetic pulse , I 'm going to show you what happens when you put a quarter on the machine . When you hear clicks we 're turning the machine on . So now I 'm going to apply that same pulse to my brain , to the part of my brain that controls my hand . So there is not physical force , just a magnetic pulse . Video : Woman : Ready ? Rebecca Saxe : Yes . Okay , so it causes a small involuntary contraction in my hand by putting a magnetic pulse in my brain . And we can use that same pulse , now applied to the RTPJ , to ask if we can change people's moral judgments . So these are the judgments I showed you before , people's normal moral judgments . And then we can apply TMS to the RTPJ and ask how people's judgments change . And the first thing is , people can still do this task overall . So their judgments of the case when everything was fine remain the same . They say she deserves no blame . But in the case of a failed attempt to harm , where Grace thought that it was poison , although it was really sugar , people now say it was more okay , she deserves less blame for putting the powder in the coffee . And in the case of the accident , where she thought that it was sugar , but it was really poison and so she caused a death , people say that it was less okay , she deserves more blame . So what I 've told you today is that people come , actually , especially well equipped to think about other people's thoughts . We have a special brain system that lets us think about what other people are thinking . This system takes a long time to develop , slowly throughout the course of childhood , and into early adolescence . And even in adulthood , differences in this brain region can explain differences among adults in how we think about and judge other people . But I want to give the last word back to the novelists . And to Philip Roth , who ended by saying , "" The fact remains that getting people right is not what living is all about anyway . It 's getting them wrong that is living . Getting them wrong and wrong and wrong , and then on careful reconsideration , getting them wrong again . "" Thank you . ( Applause ) Chris Anderson : When you start talking about using magnetic pulses to change people's moral judgments , that sounds alarming . ( Laughter ) Please tell me that you 're not taking phone calls from the Pentagon , say . Rebecca Saxe : I 'm not . I mean , they 're calling , but I 'm not taking the call . ( Laughter ) C. A. : They really are calling ? So , then seriously , then seriously , you must lie awake at night sometimes wondering where this work leads . I mean you 're clearly an incredible human being . But someone could take this knowledge and in some future not torture chamber , do acts that people here might be worried about . R. S. : Yeah , we worry about this . So , there is a couple of things to say about TMS . One is that you ca n ' t be TMSed with out knowing it . So it 's not a surreptitious technology . It 's quite hard actually to get those very small changes . The changes I showed you are impressive to me because of what they tell us about the function of the brain . But they 're small on the scale of the moral judgments that we actually make . And what we changed was not people's moral judgments when they 're deciding what to do , when they 're making action choices . We change their ability to judge other people's actions . And so I think of what I 'm doing not so much as studying the defendant in a criminal trial , but studying the jury . C. A. : Is your work going to lead to any recommendations in education , to perhaps bring up a generation of kids able to make fairer moral judgments ? R. S. : That 's one of the idealistic hopes . The whole research program here , of studying the distinctive parts of the human brain , is brand new . Until recently what we knew about the brain were the things that any other animal's brain could do too . So we could study it in animal models . We knew how brains see , and how they control the body , and how they hear and sense . And the whole project of understanding how brains do the uniquely human things , learn language , and abstract concepts , and thinking about other people's thoughts , that 's brand new . And we do n't know yet , what the implications will be of understanding it . C. A. : So I 've got one last question . There is this thing called the hard problem of consciousness , that puzzles a lot of people . The notion that you can understand why a brain works , perhaps . But why does anyone have to feel anything ? Why does it seem to require these beings who sense things for us to operate ? You 're a brilliant young neuroscientist . I mean , what chances do you think there are that at some time in your career someone , you or someone else , is going to come up with some paradigm shift in understanding what seems an impossible problem . R. S. : I hope they do . And I think they probably wo n ' t . C. A. : Why ? R. S. : It 's not called the hard problem of consciousness for nothing . ( Laughter ) C. A. : That 's a great answer . Rebecca Saxe , thank you very much . That was fantastic . ( Applause ) </content> </doc>

920,A4,"Now Keawe no sooner beheld her than he drew rein . "" I thought I knew everyone in this country , "" said he . "" How comes it that I do not know you ? "" "" I am Kokua , daughter of Kiano , "" said the girl , "" and I have just returned from Oahu . Who are you ? "" "" I will tell you who I am in a little , "" said Keawe , dismounting from his horse , "" but not now . For I have a thought in my mind , and if you knew who I was , you might have heard of me , and would not give me a true answer . But tell me , first of all , one thing : Are you married ? "" At this Kokua laughed out aloud . "" It is you who ask questions , "" she said . "" Are you married yourself ? "" "" Indeed , Kokua , I am not , "" replied Keawe , "" and never thought to be until this hour . But here is the plain truth . I have met you here at the roadside , and I saw your eyes , which are like the stars , and my heart went to you as swift as a bird . And so now , if you want none of me , say so , and I will go on to my own place ; but if you think me no worse than any other young man , say so , too , and I will turn aside to your father 's for the night , and to-morrow I will talk with the good man . "" Kokua said never a word , but she looked at the sea and laughed . "" Kokua , "" said Keawe , "" if you say nothing , I will take that for the good answer ; so let us be stepping to your father's door . "" She went on ahead of him , still without speech ; only sometimes she glanced back and glanced away again , and she kept the strings of her hat in her mouth . Now , when they had come to the door , Kiano came out on his verandah , and cried out and welcomed Keawe by name . At that the girl looked over , for the fame of the great house had come to her ears ; and , to be sure , it was a great temptation . All that evening they were very merry together ; and the girl was as bold as brass under the eyes of her parents , and made a mock of Keawe , for she had a quick wit . The next day he had a word with Kiano , and found the girl alone . "" Kokua , "" said he , "" you made a mock of me all the evening ; and it is still time to bid me go . I would not tell you who I was , because I have so fine a house , and I feared you would think too much of that house and too little of the man that loves you . Now you know all , and if you wish to have seen the last of me , say so at once . "" "" No , "" said Kokua ; but this time she did not laugh , nor did Keawe ask for more . This was the wooing of Keawe ; things had gone quickly ; but so an arrow goes , and the ball of a rifle swifter still , and yet both may strike the target . Things had gone fast , but they had gone far also , and the thought of Keawe rang in the maiden's head ; she heard his voice in the breach of the surf upon the lava , and for this young man that she had seen but twice she would have left father and mother and her native islands . As for Keawe himself , his horse flew up the path of the mountain under the cliff of tombs , and the sound of the hoofs , and the sound of Keawe singing to himself for pleasure , echoed in the caverns of the dead . He came to the Bright House , and still he was singing . He sat and ate in the broad balcony , and the Chinaman wondered at his master , to hear how he sang between the mouthfuls . The sun went down into the sea , and the night came ; and Keawe walked the balconies by lamplight , high on the mountains , and the voice of his singing startled men on ships . "" Here am I now upon my high place , "" he said to himself . "" Life may be no better ; this is the mountain top ; and all shelves about me toward the worse . For the first time I will light up the chambers , and bathe in my fine bath with the hot water and the cold , and sleep alone in the bed of my bridal chamber . "" So the Chinaman had word , and he must rise from sleep and light the furnaces ; and as he wrought below , beside the boilers , he heard his master singing and rejoicing above him in the lighted chambers . When the water began to be hot the Chinaman cried to his master ; and Keawe went into the bathroom ; and the Chinaman heard him sing as he filled the marble basin ; and heard him sing , and the singing broken , as he undressed ; until of a sudden , the song ceased . </doc>

1344,A8,"The US Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) has published three draft guidances designed to help growers and others across the entire supply chain minimise or eliminate microbial contamination in tomatoes , leafy greens , and melons . The guidances are , in part , based on those originally developed by the produce industry with assistance from FDA . They represent the first step in a fundamental shift in strategy for the agency in the prevention of foodborne hazards associated with fresh fruits and vegetables . These guidances embody the Obama Administrations and FDAs prevention-oriented food safety strategy , said FDA Commissioner Margaret A. Hamburg , M.D. They will be made final as soon as possible after public comment , and will be followed within two years by enforceable standards for fresh produce . These commodity-specific guidances were called for by the Presidents Food Safety Working Group , which recommends a new , public-health focused approach to food safety . In a report issued earlier this month , the working group made recommendations aimed at creating a stronger food safety system . The recommendations stem from three core food safety principles : prevent harm to consumers . use good data and analysis to ensure effective food safety inspections and enforcement of the law , and identify outbreaks of foodborne illness quickly and stop them . Key elements of the draft guidances related to the working groups strategies include : an acceptable baseline standard of industry practices that help both domestic and foreign firms minimise the risk for microbial contamination of their products throughout the entire supply chain ; recommendations regarding growing , harvesting , packing , processing , transportation , and distribution of the product ; and Recommendations for recordkeeping , including some that will help the FDA determine more quickly the source of outbreaks that do occur . Comments on FDAs guidance documents may be submitted at any time . However , to ensure that comments are received in time for consideration in drafting final versions of these guidance documents , written or electronic comments should be submitted within 90 days of publication in the Federal Register .

181,A1,"Geneva , 11 December 2002 SUMMARY RECORD OF THE 2nd MEETING Held at the Palais des Nations , Geneva , on Wednesday , 11 December 2002 , at 4.25 p. m . President : Mr. FAESSLER ( Switzerland ) GENERAL EXCHANGE OF VIEWS ( PLENARY ) ( continued ) The meeting was called to order at 4.25 p. m . GENERAL EXCHANGE OF VIEWS ( PLENARY ) ( agenda item 8 ) ( continued ) Mr. DOĞAN ( Turkey ) , reiterating his country's commitment to the elimination of all anti-personnel mines , said that Turkey welcomed any measures adopted to that end , whether at the bilateral or multilateral level . In January 2002 , it had decided to extend indefinitely its moratorium on the export and transfer of anti-personnel landmines , thereby demonstrating its genuine wish to become party to the Ottawa Convention . In addition to concluding bilateral agreements with its neighbouring countries to demine frontier areas , it had also contributed $ 50 , 000 to the demining activities conducted in Bosnia and Herzegovina with the assistance of Turkish troops and had provided financial support for demining projects conducted on the northern frontier of Albania , following the Kosovo conflict . By August 2002 , Turkey had already cleared more than 10,000 mines . In addition , it had set up demining and coordination centres and had trained demining teams . Turkey had suffered a great deal from terrorism and from the extensive use by terrorists of anti-personnel and anti-vehicle mines . Regrettably , terrorists did not consider themselves bound by existing legal instruments and attached scant importance to the increasing support enjoyed by such instruments . The international community should fight terrorism in a concerted manner and should use every possible means to bring terrorists and their accomplices to justice . Mr. SEETHARAM ( India ) said that he was obliged to refute the allegations made against his country by the organization Human Rights Watch . India strictly respected Amended Protocol II . Furthermore , the casualty figures cited by Human Rights Watch were unfounded and had clearly not been verified with the authorities , an omission which reflected badly on the organization . CONSIDERATION OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF TECHNOLOGIES TO PROTECT CIVILIANS AGAINST THE INDISCRIMINATE EFFECTS OF MINES ( agenda item 11 ) The PRESIDENT said that no delegation wished to take the floor on the agenda item . OTHER MATTERS ( agenda item 12 ) The PRESIDENT said that no delegation wished to take the floor on the agenda item . CONSIDERATION AND ADOPTION OF THE FINAL DOCUMENTS ( agenda item 13 ) ( CCW / AP . II / CONF . 4 / CRP . 1 , English only ) The PRESIDENT drew attention to the draft report of the Fourth Annual Conference of the States Parties to Amended Protocol II , issued under symbol CCW / AP . II / CONF . 4 / CRP . 1 , in English only , and invited the Conference to take it up paragraph by paragraph before adopting it in its entirety . Paragraphs 1-6 Paragraphs 1-6 were adopted . Paragraph 7 The PRESIDENT said that Morocco should be added to the list of States which had notified the depository of their consent to be bound by Amended Protocol II and had participated in the work of the Conference , bringing the number of such States to 46 . Paragraph 7 , as completed , was adopted . Paragraph 8 Paragraph 8 was adopted . Paragraph 9 The PRESIDENT said that the secretariat had informed him that the Islamic Republic of Iran should be removed from the list of States not parties to Amended Protocol II which had participated as observers . Mr. HORUMBA ( Observer from Romania ) said that his country should be added to that list . Paragraph 9 , as amended and completed , was adopted . Paragraph 10 Paragraph 10 was adopted . Paragraph 11 Ms. WALKER ( International Campaign to Ban Landmines ) requested that the names of all the member organizations of the International Campaign to Ban Landmines which had attended the public meetings of the Conference should be listed in the paragraph . Paragraph 11 , as completed , was adopted . Paragraph 12 Increasing the number of vice-presidents of the Annual Conference Mr. WENSLEY ( South Africa ) suggested that the number of vice-presidents of the Annual Conference should be increased to three , to ensure the representation of each group of countries and China in the General Committee of the Conference , which would therefore also be more balanced . That would also entail amending rules 3 and 7 of the rules of procedure . The PRESIDENT said he took it that the Conference wished to increase the number of vice-presidents to three . It was so decided . Mr. WENSLEY ( South Africa ) suggested that the following text should therefore be added to paragraph 12 of the draft report under consideration : "" The Conference decided to amend rules 3 and 7 of the rules of procedure in order to increase the number of vice-presidents from two to three to secure a balanced representation of geographical groups in the General Committee of the Conference . Amended rule 3 will read as follows : ' The Conference shall elect from among the States parties participating in the Conference a president and three vice-presidents . These officers shall be elected so as to ensure the representative character of the General Committee provided for in rule 7 . ' Amended rule 7 will read as follows : ' The General Committee shall be composed of the President , who shall preside , three vice-presidents and the chairs of any other subsidiary organs . ' "" Paragraph 12 , as completed , was adopted . Paragraphs 13 and 14 Paragraphs 13 and 14 were adopted . New paragraph 15 The PRESIDENT said that a new paragraph 15 should be added , to read as follows : "" At the same meeting , the Conference heard a message from the Secretary-General of the United Nations , which was read out by Mr. Enrique Román-Moray , Deputy Secretary-General of the Conference on Disarmament and Director of the Geneva Branch of the Department for Disarmament Affairs . "" New paragraph 15 was adopted . New paragraph 16 ( old paragraph 15 ) New paragraph 16 was adopted . New paragraph 17 ( old paragraph 16 ) The PRESIDENT said that the secretariat had informed him that Croatia and the United States of America should be added to the list of States which had submitted their annual reports . Mr. WENSLEY ( South Africa ) said that his country should also be added to the list . New paragraph 17 , as completed , was adopted . New paragraph 18 ( old paragraph 17 ) Mr. DAHINDEN ( Switzerland ) said that the following text should be added to new paragraph 18 : "" Switzerland suggested that a cover page should be added to the national annual reports , to simplify the transmission of information . This suggestion should be taken up in a decision to be adopted at the next Annual Conference ( see annex I ) . "" The thinking behind the suggestion was that , where the information was unchanged from one year to the next , there would be no need to submit a full new report : instead a mention on the cover page would suffice . New paragraph 18 , as completed , was adopted . New paragraph 19 ( old paragraph 18 ) Draft appeal issued by States parties to Amended Protocol II on the occasion of their Fourth Annual Conference ( CCW / AP . II / CONF . 4 / CRP . 2 ) The PRESIDENT invited the Conference to consider and adopt the draft appeal by the States parties on the occasion of their Fourth Annual Conference , contained in document CCW / AP . II / CONF . 4 / CRP . 2 and referred to in new paragraph 19 , before proceeding to the adoption of the paragraph . Recalling that the draft had been inspired by the appeal submitted by the States parties at their Third Annual Conference , held immediately prior to the Second Review Conference , he said that , in the informal consultations which he had held before the current meeting , one delegation had suggested that the text should be updated by deleting the paragraph which read : "" [ We ] welcome the opportunity provided by the Second Review Conference of the States parties to the Convention on Conventional Weapons to examine the operation and status of Amended Protocol II . "" The draft appeal issued under symbol CCW / AP . II / CONF . 4 / CRP . 2 , as amended , was adopted . New paragraph 19 was adopted . New paragraph 20 ( old paragraph 19 ) New paragraph 20 was adopted with a minor editorial change to the English text . New paragraph 21 ( old paragraph 20 ) Designation of the president and vice-presidents of the Fifth Annual Conference Mr. HOLZENBERGER ( Germany ) said that several delegations , including his own , had put forward the idea of designating the president and the vice-presidents of the Fifth Annual Conference at the end of the Fourth Conference , so that the incoming president and vice-presidents could themselves take charge of the preparations for the Conference and would then be able to conduct their work on the basis of those preparations . That approach seemed more rational than requesting the outgoing president and vice-presidents to carry out the preparatory work and more conducive to the smooth running of the Conference . Mr. PETÖCZ ( Slovakia ) , speaking on behalf of the group of Eastern European States , said that his group supported the idea . Mr. DOROSIN ( United States of America ) wondered whether it would be valid to designate the president and the vice-presidents of the Fifth Annual Conference at the current Conference . The PRESIDENT explained that the designation at the current stage of the president and vice-presidents of the Fifth Annual Conference would have to be confirmed by their election at that Conference . He took it that the Conference wished to designate the president and the vice-presidents of the Fifth Annual Conference at the current stage . It was so decided . The PRESIDENT invited groups of States to put forward candidates for the posts of president and vice-presidents of the Fifth Annual Conference . Mr. PETÖCZ ( Slovakia ) , speaking on behalf of the group of Eastern European States , said that the group proposed Ambassador Tzantchev of Bulgaria as President of the Fifth Annual Conference . Mr. WENSLEY ( South Africa ) , speaking on behalf of the group of non-aligned and other countries , said that the group proposed the representative of South Africa as Vice-President of the Fifth Conference . It was not possible , at the current stage , to give the name of the South African representative who would perform those functions since the tour of duty of the ambassador currently serving in Geneva would end during the coming few months . Mr. FU Zhigang ( China ) said that China proposed that one of its representatives should also be designated Vice-President of the Fifth Annual Conference . Mr. HOLZENBERGER ( Germany ) , speaking on behalf of the group of Western countries , said that the group also proposed the Swiss Ambassador , Mr. Faessler as Vice-President of the Fifth Annual Conference . The PRESIDENT said that , if he heard no objection , he would take it that the Conference wished to designate the Bulgarian Ambassador , Mr. Tzantchev , as President of the Fifth Annual Conference and the representatives of South Africa and China , as well as the Ambassador of Switzerland , Mr. Faessler , as Vice-Presidents of the Conference . It was so decided . The PRESIDENT suggested that new paragraph 21 should be amended and completed in the light of the decision which the Conference had just adopted . It would therefore read as follows : "" The Conference decided that the incoming president and vice-presidents would be designated at the end of the current Conference , so as to ensure the continuity of the preparatory work of the presidency . Accordingly , the Conference decided to designate the Bulgarian Ambassador , Mr. Tzantchev , as President of the Annual Conference of States Parties to be held in 2003 and the representatives of South Africa and China , and the Ambassador of Switzerland , Mr. Faessler , as Vice-Presidents . "" New paragraph 21 , as modified and completed , was adopted . New paragraph 22 ( old paragraph 21 ) The PRESIDENT drew attention to the estimated costs which would be contained in document CCW / AP . II / CONF . 4 / 3 and which were referred to in new paragraph 22 . He pointed out that , in effect , there had been two sets of estimates , depending on whether the Conference lasted one or two days . He explained that the dates given in the estimates were very tentative and recalled that the dates and duration of the Fifth Annual Conference would be decided , as indicated in the paragraph under consideration , at the Meeting of States Parties to the Convention to be held on 12 and 13 December 2002 . New paragraph 22 was adopted with a minor editorial change to the English text . New paragraph 23 ( old paragraph 22 ) Mr. FU Zhigang ( China ) questioned the wording of the paragraph , which stated that the President was requested to present the report of the Fourth Annual Conference of the States Parties to Amended Protocol II to the Meeting of States Parties to the Convention , to be held on 12 and 13 December 2002 , and wondered whether the States parties to Amended Protocol II were not themselves empowered to adopt the report of their own Fourth Annual Conference and why the report needed to be endorsed by the Meeting of States Parties . It had been his understanding that the Meeting of States Parties would have the sole purpose of considering the procedural report of the Group of Governmental Experts and deciding on follow-up to its work , as agreed by the Second Review Conference of the Convention . Mr. WENSLEY ( South Africa ) pointed out that , in 2001 , the States parties to Amended Protocol II had concluded that they should submit the report of their Third Annual Conference to the forthcoming Second Conference of States Parties , which would be responsible for reviewing the status and the operation of the Convention and its annexed protocols as a whole , including Amended Protocol II . He agreed with the representative of China that the mandate of the Meeting of States Parties on 12 and 13 December was quite different , since it had been tasked with considering the report of the Group of Governmental Experts and deciding on follow-up to its work . While he had no objection in principle to the President of the Fourth Annual Conference reporting to that Meeting , he did not believe that there was any real necessity for such a report . Mr. DA SILVA ( Brazil ) shared that view : the Meeting of States Parties on 12 and 13 December had been called with a view to considering the procedural report of the Group of Governmental Experts and it would be as well to confine it to that task . The PRESIDENT said he took it that all delegations agreed on that point . Accordingly , the second part of new paragraph 23 should be deleted and the paragraph should read as follows : "" At its final meeting , on 11 December 2002 , the Fourth Annual Conference adopted its report . "" New paragraph 23 , as amended , was adopted . The draft report of the Fourth Annual Conference of the States Parties to Amended Protocol II was adopted in its entirety . The PRESIDENT said that the Conference had concluded the consideration of its agenda . The PRESIDENT thanked all delegations and the staff of the secretariat and of Conference Services for their assistance and declared the Fourth Annual Conference of the States Parties to Amended Protocol II closed . The meeting rose at 5.30 p. m . This record is subject to correction . Corrections should be submitted in one of the working languages . They should be set forth in a memorandum and also incorporated in a copy of the record . They should be sent within one week of the date of this document to the Official Records Editing Section , room E. 4108 , Palais des Nations , Geneva . Any corrections to the records of the meetings of this Conference will be consolidated in a single corrigendum , to be issued shortly after the end of the Conference . </doc>

1162,A1,"Economics and prostitution The word "" prostitution "" has always confused the minds of people for years . Constant attempts to solve this existing problem have not really given any positive results . For some time the problem was obviously ignored by the government as if it completely did not know what to do with it . In the beginning of the XXI century a prostitute has become one of the most ordinary goods that the market can offer . It is also necessary to mention that the demand on prostitution is constantly growing due to several factors worth of separate analysis . Prostitution has always been "" covered "" from the eyes of citizens as is has always been unacceptable . Nevertheless , the problem does not disappear and in fact it becomes even more "" sharp "" with time . Of course it is easier to pretend like there is no enormous amount of women and men that have no other way to survive but offering sexual services . Basically , the Law of Canada has not done anything good enough to solve the problem in any way , except causing vagueness in the understanding of what is legal and illegal in terms of sexual services . Prostitution has a lot to do with the economy , as it is not only its "" dark "" side but also the potential legal income , which is always needed so much . So what is prostitution ? Does it need economical stimulation or should it be completely prohibited or ignored ? And should the economical approach be used to prostitution at all ? Prostitution is not and will never be a standard job and this is something that is to be never forgotten . Choosing prostitution as a "" career "" opportunity ? The most horrifying thing about prostitution is that it has become not just a way to make money for starving and homeless people but also a "" career "" opportunity for the young generation . Why do our children have to grow up with the notion that prostitution is a source of getting money and surviving in this world ? The contemporary world lives under certain regularities . A man has to get a job that will provide him or her with a sufficient amount of money in order to maintain a normal living . So if a person does not have enough knowledge to get this or that job he or she always has another opportunity - to prostitute himself or herself . Prostitution as a primitive was of making money ; it is a problem that prevents the society from its perfection and development . Prostitution is obviously a negative phenomenon , demoralizing the society but is has actually become a "" job "" for many men and women and this fact can not remain unnoticed . Definition of prostitution Prostitution does exist and it an unchallengeable fact . It existed since ancient times in different countries , with different social-political statuses . A prostitute is a person who provides sexual services in exchange for money . In other words it is a person who offers sex and gets paid for it . Nevertheless , none of the people providing this type of services are performing a business activity . It is usually believed that prostitutes are women ; nevertheless men play an important part in prostitution as an object of high demand , too . Anyhow it is very hard to give a definition to prostitution as a profession , because prostitutes do not pay taxes and do not receive any pension while on retirement . Prostitution is not illegal in Canada and this fact puts it in a very uncertain position in terms of possible "" career opportunities "" for the young generation . It is legal to sell services but it is illegal to buy them – this statement makes many people bewildered . One thing is certain for sure : prostitution – is an act of selling a person's body for further sexual services for material compensation . Danger of the oldest profession Choosing prostitution as a profession is not rational . Yes , it does bring income and the demand is always high . But what will a prostitute remain with at the threshold of the pension age ? This is one of the reasons that many people such as the criminologist Dr. John Lowman argue in favor of its legalization1 . Prostitution is considered as a potential source of renewing the budget of Canada . But there are also other reasons for not becoming a prostitute except the tax-pension side of the issue . Many of the prostitutes simply disappear and often become the victims of violence . According to the statistics "" 90 percent had been physically assaulted in prostitution and 78 percent had been raped in prostitution "" 2 . Prostitutes do not get the protection the representatives of standard professions do . They can also be the cause of spreading of venereal diseases due to the fact of absence of a proper medical checkup . This "" dangers "" put prostitution in the position of the "" risk zone "" occupation . No one will argue that choosing an occupation with high risks is not rational at all . Economical approach to prostitution Prostitution is legal in Canada . But it is only formally , because "" pimping and operating or being found in or working in a "" bawdy house "" ( every place where one or more prostitutes regularly work or where "" indecent acts "" are performed ) are not "" 3 . Criminal Code sections 210 and 211 forbid "" Bawdy houses "" and section 212 foresees responsibility for living on the avails of the prostitution of a person . How should the economical approach be applied to prostitution ? Canada's Justice has put prostitution in a position where is has to be done in certain places without any publicity or in other words it has to respect the moral abutments of the society . If prostitution is to be viewed as a type of "" profession "" than it is put on the same level with other taxpayers such as teachers , lawyers and many others . The application of the economical approach means that prostitution has to have a legal status . SO this makes us view prostitution as a business . A business activity is an independent activity directed to a systematic income arrival from property use , selling goods , work execution or rendering services registered and stated by Law . So prostitution is a systematic income obtained from rendering a service . Prostitution gets the possibility to exist illegally from the gaps in the Law and the Canadian Law with its semi-legalization does not make it easier to define the status of prostitution in the country . If prostitution is legal than prostitutes have to be 18 years old and have the right to medical and social security . At the same time they have to pay the monthly income tax , which will make the profession less profitable , then it is now . Prostitution and economy . The existance of prostitution in Canada still can be explained form the point of the economic approach for Canada has a market-based economy . According to the economic approach both of the sides have to be in profit . Demand gives birth to supply and in this terms prostitution is just the reaction of the high demand of sexual services . So it is about the morality of the society in the first place . Third parties should be completely eliminated from this "" deal "" . These third parties , known as "" pimps "" or even sex-firms are the ones to be persecuted . Sex-workers have become an integral part of Canada's society and they even form alliances such as the Sex Worker's Alliance of Vancouver . The amount of money obtained from prostitution is enormous , so therefore the budget is left without any additional financing . There are only two ways out – either to completely legalize it eliminating street prostitution or to completely forbid it . Prostitution has increased in the last years in Canada . This has a lot to do with the sex-tourists arriving to Canada searching for sexual services . This means that Canada is getting foreign "" deposits "" that go to "" nowhere "" . Prostitution can be found in Canada 's every corner and especially in its main cities4 . Its existance is conditioned by many factors . Canada is offering licensed sex but for some reason the gaps in the law enforcements are so big that it is completely impossible to notice them . In many cases prostitution is the only option of a person and the reaction of the government should not be through the legalization of this option but in the creation of other options of decent money making . The economic approach explains the existance of prostitution because any country is a big market place and is interested in profit in the first place and Canada in not an exception . "" The communicating law "" is not effective anymore . Prostitution needs to be analyzed from every single side and needs a new conception of functioning if functioning at all . The economic approach application does not imply that the profit is made on the degradation of the society . And it is obvious that if the sex-workers had education , a place to work and a decent salary they would never have found themselves on the panel and could be their labor would have brought a bigger income for the budget . Canada needs to change the economic approach to the human approach and study everything concerning the prostitution for new . </doc>

1131,A17,"' Doctor Strange ' Review : Benedict Cumberbatch's Marvel Debut Casts a Spell The comic book Sorcerer Surpreme comes to the big screen – and his origin story is a psychedelic stunner ' Doctor Strange ' brings comics' Sorcerer Surpreme to the big screen – Peter Travers on why Benedict Cumberbatch makes this the best Marvel movie yet . ' Doctor Strange ' Review : Benedict Cumberbatch's Marvel Debut Casts a Spell More News What Robert Downey , Jr. is to Iron Man and Ryan Reynolds is to Deadpool – that 's what Benedict Cumberbatch is to Doctor Strange . By that I mean , he 's everything . The British actor , flashing an American accent eons away from the plummy tones of Sherlock or Hamlet , is the creative spark that ignites this bracing new entry in the Marvel cinematic universe . That 's no knock on the movie itself , which director Scott Derrickson – the horror guy from Deliver Us from Evil , Sinister and The Exorcism of Emily Rose – has kicked up a notch with a visual dazzle and wit unseen around these parts since The Matrix and Inception . See it in 3-D IMAX , people , and you 're in for the hallucinatory headtrip of the year . And having Cumberbatch around really raises the bar on what 's possible in comic-book fantasy . Related From awards-worthy dramas and controversial history lessons to a new ' Star Wars , ' what you need to see Doctor Strange , the first in what looks to be a killer film franchise , is an origin story . And even if it feels carved out of the Marvel playbook of arrogant assholes who see the light ( read Tony Stark ) , Cumberbatch plays it fresh , funny and fierce . His Stephen Strange is a neurosurgeon with miracle hands and a grand ambition to match his gargantuan ego ; he wo n't even treat patients he thinks he ca n't cure . Rachel McAdams plays Christine Palmer , the ER doc who loves him , despite the fact that Strange thinks a romantic evening is inviting her to hear him deliver a lecture . Then , one dark night , Strange – texting while driving – crashes his Lamborghini Huracán , emerges with his hands mangled into useless digits and preps for a lifetime pity-party . As the comic book , created in 1963 by Steve Ditko and Stan Lee points out , he finds salvation in the Eastern mysticism of Kathmandu , where he meets the Ancient One , played by Tilda Swinton in a role originally conceived as an Asian man . There have been protests , and there will be more , but Swinton – radiating otherworldly power – is a world-class mesmerizer . And cheers for the mystery Chiwetel Ejiofor brings to Mordo , one of the masters in the Ancient One's service . Just do n't call it a cult . Strange does . Bad move . Can our hero learn humility and the inner power to heal himself ? Can he bend and fold time into shapes with an out-of-body wizardry his hands can no longer provide ? You bet your ass . Cumberbatch , Swinton , and Ejiofer are not slumming at all here , and these top-of-the-line actors giving the blockbuster a riveting , resonant send-off , whooshed along by Michael Giacchino's propulsive score . Add Mads Mikkelsen as Kaecilius , the Ancient One's traitorous former disciple and Benedict Wong as Wong , the protector of the Ancient One's secret books . "" What , just one name , "" asks Strange sarcastically . "" Like Adele or Beyonce . "" Not like them at all , actually , something unique . Doctor Strange is similarly unique , deviating just enough from the cookie-cutter Marvel pattern to become its own living , breathing , thrilling thing – wait until you see his Cloak of Levitation , his encounter with the Dark Dimension , and the fight scene on the streets of New York that melts into a kaleidoscope of melting images scary enough to haunt your nightmares . Through it all , there 's Strange , a character that Cumberbatch catches in the fascinating act of inventing of himself as a new sorcerer supreme . Stick through the film's final credits and you 'll see a bonus scene that suggests Strange inching into the world of the Avengers . But for right now , Doctor Strange creates its own world .

This will help keep water away from the drill and normal sediment from collecting in the valve . Water Supply Requirements Gather the required tools and parts before starting installation . Read and follow the instructions provided with any tools listed here . TOOLS NEEDED : Flat-blade screwdriver 1 ⁄ 4 "" Drill bit 7 ⁄ 16 "" and 1 ⁄ 2 "" Open-end or two adjustable wrenches Hand drill or electric drill ( properly grounded ) 1 ⁄ 4 "" nut driver A NOTE : Your refrigerator dealer has a kit available with a 1 ⁄ 4 "" ( 6 . 35 mm ) saddle-type shutoff valve , a union , and copper tubing . Before purchasing , make sure a saddle-type valve complies with your local plumbing codes . Do not use a piercing-type or 3 ⁄ 16 "" ( 4 . 76 mm ) saddle valve which reduces water flow and clogs more easily . IMPORTANT : 4 . Determine the length of copper tubing you need . Measure from the connection on the lower rear corner of refrigerator to the water pipe . Add 7 ft ( 2 . 1 m ) to allow for cleaning . Use 1 ⁄ 4 "" ( 6 . 35 mm ) O.D. ( outside diameter ) copper tubing . Be sure both ends of copper tubing are cut square . 5 . Using a grounded drill , drill a 1 ⁄ 4 "" ( 6 . 35 mm ) hole in the cold water pipe you have selected . Use copper tubing and check for leaks . Install copper tubing only in areas where the household temperatures will remain above freezing . Water Pressure A cold water supply with water pressure of between 30 and 120 psi ( 207 - 827 kPa ) is required to operate the water dispenser and ice maker . If you have questions about your water pressure , call a licensed , qualified plumber . Reverse Osmosis Water Supply IMPORTANT : The pressure of the water supply coming out of a reverse osmosis system going to the water inlet valve of the refrigerator needs to be between 30 and 120 psi ( 207 - 827 kPa ) . If a reverse osmosis water filtration system is connected to your cold water supply , the water pressure to the reverse osmosis system needs to be a minimum of 40 to 60 psi ( 276 - 414 kPa ) . If the water pressure to the reverse osmosis system is less than 40 to 60 psi ( 276 - 414 kPa ) : osmosis system is blocked . Replace the filter if necessary . Allow the storage tank on the reverse osmosis system to refill after heavy usage . If your refrigerator has a water filter , it may further reduce the water pressure when used in conjunction with a reverse osmosis system . Remove the water filter . See "" Water Filtration System .

1509,A7,"Tips for living with coyotes Thu July 25 , 2013 10 : 29pm Coyotes are part of the natural habitat in California , and they are increasingly adept at searching for food in cities because their natural habitat has increasingly been encroached by development . Coyote conflicts with humans are extremely rare , even though coyote activity is higher during this time of year as this is the season when they are raising their pups . If you walk your dog in or near any of the known coyote habitats , keep your dog on a leash at all times as required by municipal codes . If possible , avoid walking dogs in the early morning or at dusk , which are prime feeding times for coyotes . Keep small pets indoors , especially cats - they are an easy favored prey Coyotes and other predators may be attracted to areas that provide protective cover . Remove hiding spaces by keeping brush and weeds from around buildings cleared . Many coyotes have lost their natural fear of humans . The best thing that you can do if you see a coyote is to "" haze "" them . This involves standing tall and making yourself look big while waving your arms ; yelling at them to go away ; throwing objects toward them ; or spraying them with water . It is essential that coyotes retain their natural fear of humans . Never run from a coyote . Keep constant eye contact with the coyote and continue to move toward other people , a building or an area of activity . In the event of a life-threatening emergency please call 911 . LBACS advises residents to report coyote attacks , threats and aggressive behavior at 562-570-7387 . If coyotes are sighted in areas where there are children ( schools , parks , etc. ) or if the coyotes are acting aggressively , an officer will be dispatched immediately . Additionally , LBACS takes reports of coyote activities and forwards any threats to pets or people to the California Department of Fish and Wildlife so that they may respond appropriately . To report a coyote incident online and for further information on reducing conflicts and hazing techniques , please visit www.longbeach.gov/acs/wildlife . Post new comment </doc>

745,A1,"In three words the Humanist ethical tradition consists of freedom , happiness and virtue . Included in the word ' freedom ' is freethought , free speech and expression , free publication and , many people would say , free trade . Humanists have worked for the emancipation of slaves and of women and lesbians and gay men . Support has been given to independence of peoples and countries and to liberty in all its forms . Freedom is not the same as licence [ in the sense of unrestrained liberty of action , disregard of law or propriety , abuse of freedom , or licentiousness ] , and should not be had at the expense of the liberty of others . It applies primarily to the freedom of the individual and is often expressed in terms of human rights . Political freedom is , like peace , essentially a negative concept . Freedom in all its forms is abhorrent to authoritarians . The French philosopher Claude-Adien Helvetius wrote in 1758 in his book De l ' esprit , "" The free person is one who is not in irons , nor imprisoned in a gaol , nor terrorised like a slave by fear of punishment . "" Epicurus wrote , "" A free life can not acquire great wealth , because the task is not easy without slavery to the mob or those in power ; rather it already possesses everything in constant abundance . And if one did somehow achieve great wealth , one could easily share this out in order to obtain the good will of one's neighbours . "" He also wrote , "" The greatest fruit of self-sufficiency is freedom "" . As human society changes , freedom requires ' eternal vigilance ' . It has been described in terms of ' the open mind , in the open society ' . It is the environment in which we can lead happy lives .

185,A11,"Held at the Palais des Nations , Geneva , on Thursday , 30 August 2007 , at 10.15 a . m . President : Mr. Faysal KHABBAZ HAMOUI ( Syrian Arab Republic ) The PRESIDENT ( spoke in Arabic ) : I declare open the 1080th plenary meeting of the Conference on Disarmament . At the outset , I should like to extend a warm welcome on behalf of the Conference on Disarmament to the participants in the United Nations Programme of Fellowships on Disarmament who are observing the proceedings of this plenary . I am quite sure they will benefit from their participation in this forum , especially from the presentations that will be made to them on the various aspects of the work of the Conference . On behalf of the Conference on Disarmament and on my own behalf , I should like to bid farewell to Ambassador Elisabeth Bonnier , our distinguished colleague from Sweden , who will be leaving Geneva soon to take up other important duties , having brought with her a wealth of experience gained within the Swedish Foreign Ministry and abroad , including a first round from 1983 to 1988 in the Conference on Disarmament and also as a member of the Secretary-General's Advisory Board on Disarmament Matters . Ambassador Elisabeth Bonnier joined us in 2003 as the Permanent Representative of Sweden to the United Nations Office and other international organizations in Geneva . As a representative of a country with a pre-eminent focus on multilateral disarmament and non-proliferation , she has always been actively and insistently involved in the effort to break the deadlock in this body and to resume the substantive work . I should like to express my particular gratitude to her for her extensive efforts to end the stalemate in this body as one of the six Presidents of this year's session . On behalf of the Conference and on my own behalf , I would like to convey to Ambassador Bonnier every wish for success and happiness . While we are sad to see Ambassador Bonnier leave Geneva , I am happy to extend a cordial welcome to our new colleague from Canada , Ambassador Marius Grinius . On behalf of the Conference on Disarmament and on my own behalf , I would like to assure Ambassador Grinius of our readiness to provide him with every kind of assistance and support for his work in Geneva . Before turning to the speakers for today , I would like to introduce the Presidential report on the third part of the 2007 session . I closely followed the consultations that the former President of the Conference on Disarmament , Ambassador Jürg Streuli , held on the Presidential proposal . I also followed the work of the six Presidents on the same matter . A series of meetings were held with a large number of Ambassadors of member States . Allow me to summarize the results of these activities as set forth in the Presidential report on part 3 of the 2007 session , which was distributed to you today by the secretariat . My evaluation of the results consists of three points . The first point is that a wide range of delegations expressed their support for the Presidential proposal based on the three annexed documents , L. 1 CRP . 5 and CRP . 6 . Although some delegations expressed reservations about certain elements of the proposal , they said that they were willing to join the consensus on the proposal . Others expressed the view that more work and consultations were needed to reach a consensus . The second point is that the Conference on Disarmament has achieved substantial progress by conducting important thematic debates on all agenda items . However , it has not yet been able to reach a consensus on a programme of work . As to the third point , momentum has been created to end the long-standing impasse at the Conference on Disarmament and efforts to reach an agreement must be continued . This is the summary of the three points contained in the Presidential report on part 3 of the 2007 session . I should now like to open the floor to any delegations that wish to make a statement at today's meeting . I have no speakers on my list . Does any delegation wish to take the floor ? The Ambassador of Sweden . You have the floor . Ms. BORSIIN BONNIER ( Sweden ) : Mr. President , I thank you very much , and initially , let me warmly welcome you on the assumption of the Chair of this august body . Although I will be leaving Geneva , I assure you that my delegation will continue to do its utmost to support you in the important tasks ahead . I also thank you warmly for your initial kind remarks on my person . This is my last plenary meeting , and therefore , in line with the traditions of the CD , I will conclude with a few personal remarks . Mr. President , for altogether nine years , as you noted , I have entered this Council chamber with hope and with expectations . I have seen this room being the anchor of sincere multilateral work to bring about a more secure world . At times the Conference on Disarmament has even been the centre of gravity for the international community in Geneva . I have seen it vibrating with energy , bold ideas , creative intellect focused on problem-solving and a determination to make a difference and to turn the tide . Important pieces of international law have been negotiated here ; compliance with vital norms has been discussed and defended with vigour and conviction . But I have also seen the opposite : an anaemic stalemate with delegations resorting to recitals of ceremonious mantras , covering up the traces of their own passivity with useless finger-pointing and blame games , hiding behind the commas of the rules of procedure and shamelessly abusing the consensus rule to abort any attempt to seriously tackle difficult or sensitive issues - in effect taking the whole multilateral approach to disarmament and arms control hostage to their own particular perceptions , preferences or dictates . But still , I continue to enter this room with hope and expectations . The certainties of yesterday are gone . Security perceptions , threats and challenges are in a state of flux . New dangers are emerging , adding to the burden of the old ones . But the debate of old versus new threats is a meaningless one . Unless we try to face both , neither will be dealt with . In the nuclear field we see more brinkmanship than statesmanship . Globalization works to make complex weapon technologies widely available . Military expenses have risen to well beyond a trillion United States dollars . The illusion of an impenetrable defence is taking new forms . Our space assets with their huge scientific and economic potentials are not secure . Cyber-wars are no longer just science fiction , but can disrupt our societies on a massive scale . The overall balance between global security problems solved and those unsolved is , I believe , negative . The uncertainties of tomorrow are , however - and let us not forget - the opportunities of today . Reluctantly or enthusiastically we will have to accept that global problems in a time of galloping globalization can not be solved unilaterally , bilaterally or even in small circles of like-minded nations . Global security must be built globally . Effective multilateralism is both necessary and possible . It means that the legitimate security concerns of all States must be acknowledged . It means seizing opportunities when they arise . It means reconsidering positions that yield no results . And it means a readiness to give and take . Global security can never be a zero-sum game . Just as the rule of law is a fundamental cornerstone in domestic affairs , so it must also be in international affairs . Without it we will be on the slippery slope towards anarchy and the use of force . Laws are sometimes broken , but this does not make them less essential . Quite the opposite . It reinforces the need to uphold and strengthen them . This is particularly important in the area of international security relations . But there are serious lacunae , both as regards the laws themselves and our ability to see them complied with . We do have a forum where we can approach all these difficult realities together . It is called the Conference on Disarmament . Rejecting the use of the CD is irresponsible . Those blocking the potentials of this body should understand that they are inflicting real damage not only to the security of others , to our common security , but in the long run also to their own . Since the beginning of this year I have had the privilege of working as one of the P-6 . This Presidential sextet has jointly and consistently tried to put the CD back to work , tried to move us from talk shop to workshop , tried to make us take on the challenges of our time . And by now , most delegations stand ready to try . We have come very close to begin a beginning . As I am now leaving , I am sorry not to be with you when you cross the last bridge . Because cross it you will . There is no other way . Now there remains for me only to express my many and sincere thanks : to the Secretary-General for his support , wisdom and friendship , always at our side . To my fellow P-6 colleagues and our coordinators for their remarkable team spirit and seriousness of purpose . To my colleagues , the CD Ambassadors and their delegations for their many expressions of support and friendship . To everyone in the secretariat who keeps toiling for us in good spirits and solidarity . To the interpreters who try to make sense of our sometimes incomprehensible utterings in all languages . And to the representatives of civil society who with great patience and frustration stay engaged . Thank you all . When I leave this Council chamber today I will do so as I have always entered it - with hope and expectations . The PRESIDENT ( spoke in Arabic ) : I thank the Ambassador of Sweden for her kind wishes addressed to the Conference , and we in turn wish her every success . The delegation of France has asked for the floor . You have the floor , Madam . Ms. RAMIS-PLUM ( France ) ( spoke in French ) : I simply wished to raise a point of a technical or even presentational nature in the draft decision which is attached to the report on the third part of our session . I think there is simply a small presentational matter which , in the opinion of my delegation , needs to be rectified . The body of decision L. 1 has been separated presentationally from the complementary Presidential statement . We consider that , in the original version of this document these two elements which from a whole were together and should remain together , as they were in the text of decision L. 1 which has been distributed until now . The PRESIDENT ( spoke in Arabic ) : I thank the representative of France . We shall discuss this matter with the secretariat . Does any delegation wish to make a statement ? I do not see any . Concerning next week's work , the secretariat , later this afternoon , will place the draft report on the 2007 session in the members' pigeonholes . For ease of access , the secretariat will also send out an electronic copy , in PDF format , to the regional coordinators , who can then distribute the document to the members of their respective groups . Next week , i . e . on Tuesday 4 September 2007 , I will proceed with the first reading . As usual , this will be done at an informal meeting right after the formal plenary , which will start at 10 a . m . in this room . Before bringing this morning's work to a close I wish to make some comments on the final report . First , I should like to thank my colleagues the Ambassadors of the G-6 for their strong support for this draft report . I also wish to thank the secretariat for its outstanding efforts which helped us to complete this draft on time for it to be translated into all the United Nations official languages . As I have already said , the G-6 chairpersons helped us to prepare this report and supported it once it had been completed . The report reflects the consensus in the group . We all hope that this consensus will lead to a consensus within the Conference , especially given that the G-6 represents a wide cross section of the Conference membership . We look forward to your cooperation in adopting this report , which we endeavoured to ensure would contain an objective and impartial account of the proceedings at this year's Conference . We did our utmost to take account of the concerns of all the members , which was not an easy task . The President hopes that when the draft text is discussed next Tuesday , it will enjoy the support of you all , that you will take account of these comments , and show the necessary flexibility for its adoption . Thank you for your understanding . Before closing the meeting , does any delegation wish to take the floor ? I see none . I declare this meeting adjourned . The meeting rose at 10.45 a . m . ( Ms. Borsiin Bonnier , Sweden ) ( The President ) </doc>

217,A8,"Letter dated 29 October 2001 from the Permanent Representative of Cuba to the United Nations addressed to the Secretary-General I have the honour to transmit herewith a summary prepared by the National Assembly of People's Power of the Republic of Cuba concerning the principal terrorist actions against Cuba during the period 1990-2000 ( see annex ) . I should be grateful if you would arrange for this letter and its annex to be circulated as a document of the General Assembly , under the item "" Measures to eliminate international terrorism "" , and of the Security Council . Accept , Sir , the assurances of my highest consideration . ( Signed ) Bruno Rodríguez Parrilla Ambassador Permanent Representative Annex to the letter dated 29 October 2001 from the Permanent Representative of Cuba to the United Nations addressed to the Secretary-General Summary of principal terrorist actions against Cuba ( 1990-2000 ) Since 1959 , counter-revolutionary groups established and run by the United States Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA ) have committed a number of terrorist acts , which have cost our country valuable lives and vast resources . In the early 1990s , encouraged by the collapse of the socialist camp , these groups acting from United States territory and other bases of operations in Central America intensified their violent actions against the people of Cuba and their leaders . Details are given below of some of the most important of these , about which information has been made public : 17 July 1990 . After lobbying by the Florida Republican Congresswomen Ileana Ros and Connie Mack , the President of the United States , George Bush , released the known terrorist Orlando Bosch , who master-minded the attack which destroyed a Cuban civilian aircraft in mid-flight in October 1976 , killing all 73 persons on board . 14 October 1990 . Armed infiltration via Santa Cruz del Norte organized from Miami of two terrorists with orders to commit acts of violence . Their weapons and forged documents issued in Miami were confiscated . They were carrying flyers inviting people to join the so-called "" Cuban Liberation Army "" led by Higinio Diaz Anne , who gave them money and leaflets before their departure . 15 May 1991 . José Basulto , former Bay of Pigs mercenary , known terrorist and CIA agent , founded the so-called "" Brothers to the Rescue "" and for that purpose asked the United States President , George Bush , for three United States Air Force 0-2 aircraft , the military version of the Cessna , which had been used during the war in El Salvador .

At its request , an official Security Council document was issued containing a decision of the United States Department of Justice dated 23 June 1989 declaring that Orlando Bosch was excludable from United States territory because of extensive evidence of his past and present terrorist activities , including the bombing of a Cuban airliner in 1976 . This person is now freely walking the streets of Miami , following a presidential pardon granted to him by President George Bush . 4 July 1992 . A group of terrorists from the United States tried to attack economic targets along the Havana coastline .

Following various exchanges in which the Government of Cuba gave the Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) and other agencies of the United States Government information on terrorist activities in the United States against Cuba , an official delegation that included two senior FBI officials came to Havana and was provided with specific information , including films , tapes and other material evidence on the activities of 40 terrorists operating from United States territory . 12 July 1998 . The New York Times of that date reported statements by the Cuban-American Antonio Jorge Álvarez that the FBI had not investigated his reports of a planned attack against President Fidel Castro to be carried out at the Ibero-American Summit in Venezuela . Álvarez said that he had provided information the preceding year to the effect that Posada Carriles and a group that worked in his factory in Guatemala were planning such an attack and the bombings in Havana : "" I risked my life and my business , and they did nothing "" . 12 and 13 July 1998 . In an interview with The New York Times , Luis Posada Carriles admitted that he had organized the bombing campaign against tourist sites in Cuba , that the leaders of the Cuban American National Foundation had financed his operations and that Jorge Mas Canosa , the Foundation's President , had personally overseen the flow of money and logistical support : "" Jorge controlled everything . Whenever I needed money , he said to give me $ 5 , 000 , give me $ 10 , 000 , give me $ 15 , 000 , and they sent it to me "" . Posada also admitted that he had paid Raúl Cruz León to plant the bombs in Havana hotels . Referring to the Italian tourist killed by one of them , he told the Times : "" That Italian was sitting in the wrong place at the wrong time "" . To prepare these articles , the Times used Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA ) and FBI files , testimony from more than 100 people and more than 13 hours of taped interviews with Posada , and even documents which he himself had signed . 23 July 1998 . The Miami press published an article entitled "" Anti-Castro plots seldom lead to jail in U. S. "" . The article cited a number of cases , such as the 1990 acquittal of six terrorists who had shipped a cannon and other weapons to Nicaragua to attack the Cuban President , and the 1994 cases of Rodolfo Frómeta and Fausto Marimón , who were charged with planning to use Stinger anti-aircraft missiles and other weapons for terrorist activities . The article also included statements by the well-known terrorist Tony Bryant to the effect that , in 1989 , the FBI had stopped him with a shipment of weapons and explosives in a boat , but had let him go . He added that two of his 14 missions against Cuba had been intercepted but that nothing had ever happened to him . 2 August 1998 . Posada Carriles , in an interview for the programme Polos Opuestos on the television channel CBS Telenoticias , said that he intended to perpetrate further attacks against Cuban installations within or outside the island . August 1998 . Following the announcement that President Fidel Castro would attend the Caribbean Forum summit meeting in the Dominican Republic , terrorist elements of Cuban origin planned to carry out an attack between 20 and 25 August . To that end , the terrorist Posada Carriles held a meeting at the Holiday Inn hotel in Guatemala City one month beforehand to plan how to bring weapons and explosives to Santo Domingo . 12 September 1998 . Authorities in Miami arrested the five Cuban patriots who had done their duty to defend Cubans and Americans against the terrorist acts organized , prepared and launched against Cuba , with total impunity , from United States territory . 17 November 2000 . Panamanian authorities arrested a group of terrorists headed by Posada Carriles , who had entered Panama with false documents to carry out an attack against President Fidel Castro during the tenth Ibero-American Summit of Heads of State and Government . Weapons , explosives and sketches of the Cuban President's route and scheduled public appearances were seized . The Cuban American National Foundation financed the team of lawyers hired to defend the terrorists . 26 April 2001 . Three terrorists belonging to the F-45 and Alpha 66 commando groups tried to enter Cuba from the north of Villa Clara province and were captured after they shot at Cuban border guards who detected them . Authorities seized four AKM rifles , one M-3 gun with a silencer , three handguns , a large supply of ammunition , night-vision weapon sights and means of communication , which were to be used to carry out acts of sabotage and terrorism in Cuba . In addition to the above-mentioned acts , the Cuban authorities have learned of 16 planned attacks against the President of Cuba , eight planned attacks against other leaders of the Revolution and 140 other terrorist plans between 1990 and 2001 , which were thwarted , discouraged or blocked by the work of Cuba's security and intelligence agencies . </doc>

1302,A1,"Rugby After the success of Rugby Expo 2008 , the team have launched Rugby Expo 09 to be held in Earl's Court , London on 24th – 25th November , 2009 . According to their brochure : "" Rugby Expo combines a live exhibition and structured conference programme with a special Awards Dinner to produce the ideal environment for networking and finding new business . It is a chance to learn from the experts on rugby's most topical issues and commercial developments . Most of all , it is a unique opportunity to meet senior executives from all over the world and all areas of the game in a relaxed social atmosphere "" . A Innovative technology is the foundation for performance , comfort and protection . Shock Doctor develops technologies to protect athletes so they can achieve their maximum performance . Shock Doctor has grown from the unchallenged leader in mouthguard technology , to a leading sports protection brand , protecting athletes at all levels across all sports . Shock Doctor sell a full line of patented , technologically-advanced mouthguards , Shock Doctor manufactures more than 650 SKUs and offers a comprehensive line of innovative performance products , including core protective gear for hockey , football , baseball , lacrosse , martial arts and motorsports , as well as protective cups , supporters , compression shorts , and patented Powder Dry gear bags . Shock Doctor uses a patented technology process in it 's mouth guards , for the ultimate in impact protection . For instance : • The Gel Max Integrated Lip Guard protects both upper and lower lips with a flexible , durable lip guard . It is also constructed of a high grade heavy duty rubber , that is shaped into an exoskeletal shock frame , which provides integrated jaw pads for maximum protection for teeth , jaw and brain . • The Ultra STC mouth guard uses a super tight compression gel technology that custom molds to teeth for a comfortable fit . The Ultra STC's lightweight profile fits closer and directs impact away from the vulnerable front teeth by using stronger triple rooted molars that stabilize and shield teeth . Also , when the Ultra STC guard is worn correctly it 's performance is enhanced as it positions the lower jaw down and forward , while positioning the tongue up onto the roof of the mouth allowing easier breathing and speaking . • The Double Braces uses Shock Doctor's "" Insta – Fit "" technology , which is a special Ortho channel that fits around both upper and lower teeth brace brackets , allowing adaptable tooth position as braces are adjusted . This prevents lacerations from occurring for people wearing braces . Shock Doctor's Double Braces meets NFHS high school wrestling rules , which require full coverage of upper and lower brace brackets in all wrestling competitions . It 's also made of 100 % medical grade silicone , making boiling un-necessary . Canterbury of New Zealand have released a boot upper technology that looks like a finger print . According to Canterbury claim : "" Zygo is a unique boot technology that increases kicking distance , power and imparts more spin on to a ball . Specially developed pods are positioned on the front to improve control and on the side to improve grip . The pods are specifically formulated to reduce energy loss in the interaction between boot and ball , this allows the ball to leave the foot with greater speed "" Although the overall number of successful kicks appears to be consistent with previous Rugby World Cup tournaments , there has been significant media attention surrounding the flight of the Rugby World Cup ball , developed by GILBERTTM . Originally instigated by reaction from the players , particularly Jonny Wilkinson and Dan Carter , problems that may cause missed conversions include over-inflation and wear and tear . So is there any truth in what the players or manufacturers say ? The explanation for perceived differences depend on which view , the players or the manufacturers , you care to believe . Jonny Wilkinson , in an interview prior to the semi-final match against France , said "" It 's important for the kickers because you want to be in as much control as you can . However , it 's impossible to tell how it will go . I have no idea what happens after the ball leaves my foot . I can only go on how the ball feels coming off my foot . A few kicks have surprised me by going wide but a few others have surprised me because they went over in this tournament "" . Players , particularly Jonny , are known to train daily ; kicking numerous punts , drop-kicks and conversions . The repeatability of player performance has yet to be quantified ; however it is certain that professional kickers have an expert opinion on ball performance . Perception is influenced by mood , health and feeling however concerns have been ranged in a number of matches reducing these effects . So , if we believe the players point of view , then ball material and construction must be at fault . Yet , GILBERTTM have conducted numerous player and mechanical tests to show that its flight characteristics are similar to previous balls , namely the Xact ® used in 2003 RWC . If you believe the manufacturer's opinion is correct then environmental characteristics must cause the irregular flight , such as air density and viscosity in the stadium , and wind velocity . This may be true but we must consider all possibilities . Is it over-inflation , under-inflation , grip pattern , panel pattern , weave anisotropy , bladder material , shell material , stitching design or strength , out-of-balance forces , vibration characteristics , etc ? Of course , the design characteristics and construction of the bladder , grip pattern and laminate material are top secret however from recent research we can begin to understand the flight of the ball . The following suggestions and hypothesis are written to cause further discussion . Firstly , it is impossible for a player to repeatedly strike the ball at the same point , speed , and accuracy every time , otherwise all kicks would be converted ; indeed we must consider human error as a possible cause . If in fact , the difference can be attributed to over-inflation , then we must consider why the balls are over-inflated . England claims that the ball for their opening match was pressurised to 10.5 psi rather than the optimum 9.5 psi . Over-inflation will change ball performance however there is little published literature in this area , particularly for rugby ball flight . It has been suggested that an under-inflated ball will travel further but is more difficult to aim and an over-inflated ball is harder to kick but easier to aim . This human-error by the officials was supposedly rectified for the rest of the tournament . From video analysis , kicks appear to veer to the right and left of the posts . Therefore ball spin and aerodynamics must be another cause , which can be affected by stitch and panel design as well as "" still "" air in the stadium . Alternatively , assuming the ball uses a poly-cotton weave construction , fabric anisotropy may be the reason for off-centre ball flight . Although studies of the grip pattern have been shown to improve handling characteristics , it is unlikely that the pattern will significantly affect aerodynamics . Pimple height is relatively small compared to overall ball geometry ; which is not the case in golf ball design . Perhaps water retention may be the cause although GILBERTTM claims this has been improved . It has been shown that added moisture , therefore added mass , reduces the distance kicked . Out-of-balance forces are also caused by water retention and valve placement altering ball spin . If we believe that GILBERTTM are aiming to optimise ball design for true-flight , then we may consider the possibility that kickers are used to poorer performing balls and that they have designed their kicking technique to suit . So , what is the reason ? Unfortunately from current literature it is not possible to give an exact answer . Few have studied the aerodynamics of rugby balls on the field-of-play , few have studied the mechanical properties of ball materials in flight , few can track a rugby ball in flight to determine spin rates , few understand the mechanisms of friction , few understand the handling characteristics , few can quantify the repeatability of ball strike , few understand vibration in ball impacts , and so on . Perhaps computer modelling and advancements in testing methods will provide us with answers and we can only hope that manufacturers develop further understanding of the mechanisms of ball flight on the field of play . </doc>

1654,A16,"The Kursaal Congress Centre and Auditorium is a complex comprising several spaces : a great auditorium , many-use halls and exhibition halls . It was designed by Spanish architect Rafael Moneo , and is located in Donostia-San Sebastián ( Basque Country , Spain ) . It opened in 1999 . It consists of several spaces , including the 1 , 800-seat concert hall , the Palacio de Congresos-Auditorio Kursaal , and is the home of the biggest film festival in Spain , the San Sebastian International Film Festival , in existence since 1953 . The historic Kursaal casino , next to the river's mouth The Great Kursaal was an elegant palace built in 1921 , incorporating a casino , a restaurant , a cinema theater , complementary rooms and an 859-seat theater , placed in front of the Gros beach , and next to the mouth of the Urumea river , but it was pulled down in 1973 . An empty plot ( later called K Plot ) was freed . The absence of any architectonic structure in such a privileged site for so many years was remarkable . At the time the old palace was pulled down , a competition was held to find a replacement . However , the winning project was never constructed due to its complexity . A new project proposal was submitted in 1972 . After a few changes to the design , building work was started in 1975 , but after the perimeter wall was complete and the foundations in place , works was halted . The plot of land then passed from private hands ( as the Great Kursaal had been private ) to public hands , so a public consortium was created for the purposes of constructing a new building . After the project was written down between 1991 and 1994 , the works were begun in 1996 , and were not finished until 1999 . During this period some funding problems arose , mainly because of the refusal of the Basque Government ( who paid for a 16 % of the total cost ) to increase the funds . After these problems were solved , the works were concluded in 1999 . The Kursaal Congress Centre was designed by Rafael Moneo and awarded the European Union Prize for Contemporary Architecture in 2001 . The initial impact of the buildings in the Donostia landscape ( characterized by its French style architecture ) was deemed negative by Donostians : the curved sandstone buildings clashed with a sharp-edged crystal structure . The significance of the building ( opened August 23 , 1999 , with a concert of the Euskadi Simphonic Orchestra and Ainhoa Arteta ) was also eclipsed by the parallel construction of the Guggenheim museum in Bilbao , which was twice as expensive as the Kursaal . However , after an adaptation period , and thanks to the positive impact it had in the economy , tourism and cultural life of Donostia , most citizens today appreciate the Kursaal building , and support it . Night view of Kursaal Palace lit up with Rainbow flag colors . It is mainly constituted as two large prismatic volumes , that emerge from a platform . Each "" cube "" ( as they are known ) , is formed by an inner prismatic structure , surrounded by double translucent glass panels , which are supported by a metallic structure . Between the cubes there is a big walkable surface , with sights to the Zurriola Beach and the mouth of the Urumea river . Various concerts of the Donostia Jazz Festival ( "" Jazzaldia "" ) , and many other events , take place in that terrace . Kursaal Auditorium Placed inside the biggest cube ( and closest to the sea ) , this auditorium can hold an audience of 1,800 , and is the most frequently used one for big events . The first seat rows can be removed to make room for the orchestra in an opera . Chamber Hall This seats 600 people , and is placed in the small cube . It is used for congresses or smaller concerts . Multiple-use rooms These are used for a variety of events for more limited audiences . Exhibition halls The halls are used for housing galleries and other exhibitions . Kubo Hall It is an exhibition hall under the supervision of the Kutxa savings bank . Moreover , the building has a restaurant owned by Martín Berasategui , various shops in its basement , and a car park . </doc>

1519,A7,"Tips Today is National Boss's Day ; a secular holiday celebrated around the world on Oct. 16 each year . It reportedly began in 1958 when a woman named Patricia Bays Haroski registered the holiday with the U.S. Chamber of Commerce because she wanted to designate a day for employees to show appreciation for their managers . Haroski chose Oct. 16 because it was her father's birthday , and she working for him at the time as a secretary for the State Farm Insurance Company in Illinois . In 1962 , four years after registering the holiday , the Illinois Governor officially proclaimed the day , which is now observed in the U.S. and countries such as Canada , Australia and India . Millions of appreciative workers will take full advantage of the day ; thanking their boss ' for their support , encouragement and guidance throughout the year . Others , however , have little to celebrate today . These are typically employees who have terrible relationships with their managers . If you fall into that second group of workers , National Boss's Day is the perfect opportunity to reflect on your employee-employer relationship , and think about ways to improve it . "" It 's very important to have a strong , or otherwise healthy relationship with your boss for a variety of reasons , "" says Teri Hockett , chief executive of What 's For Work ? , a career site for women . "" First , your boss has a tremendous amount of influence over workplace stress , whether real or perceived . They can make the workplace exciting and something to look forward to each day , or a place that you dread visiting . In short , your health is at stake , "" she says . "" Second , they typically hold the key to your advancement within the company , or sometimes outside as well . Without a good relationship , they may not speak highly of you or consider nominating you to other positions , departments or companies , regardless of your performance . And third , having a good relationship with your boss just makes sense . Work consumes most of your time usually , and having good relationships will make things more enjoyable and lead to opportunities . "" Joyce Maroney , senior director of customer experience and services marketing for Kronos , a Mass. - based workforce management software and services company , says the boss-employee relationship is much like others we need to manage in our lives . "" We get out of them what we put into them – as long as both parties are committed to the relationship , "" she says . "" If both parties are n't clear in communicating their expectations and giving feedback when expectations are n't met , little issues can snowball to the point the relationship is no longer viable . "" Maroney says a recent Kronos survey revealed that 69 % of employees believe their managers set a good example in the way they behave and 92 % of those employees also believe their managers adhere to those values on a regular basis . "" But setting a good example for behavior does n't always translate into a strong relationship . Employees might not get the direct and constructive performance feedback they need to elevate their career – or the boss is n't all that invested so he or she does n't push the team to consistently achieve and grow . "" Sandy Mazur , a division president at Spherion , a recruiting and staffing firm , agrees . "" In order to grow , learn and advance in their careers , employees need to be on the same page with their supervisors about their goals , objectives and career path , "" she says . "" And employees should start this dialogue so that they can open the lines of communication with their supervisor and engage them in this process . "" According to a recent Spherion "" Emerging Workforce "" study , most workers rate their relationship with their supervisor as good , great or excellent ( 84 % ) . "" However , for the small amount of people that rate their relationship as weak , it could be related to trust . Strong relationships are based on trust from both parties , and it takes an open line of communication from both the employee and the supervisor to make that happen . "" Other reasons some employees have such weak relationships with their boss ? Andy Teach , a corporate veteran and author of From Graduation to Corporation , says sometimes it 's simply due to the "" very nature of the boss-employee dynamic . "" "" If an employee has someone over them who is constantly telling them what to do and in many instances , how to do it , this can easily cause friction and resentment , "" he says . "" An employee is always being held accountable by their supervisor and this just adds stress to the employee 's already stressful work day . In addition , there are many employees who are jealous of their boss and perhaps feel that they , not the boss , should be the one in charge . Again , this causes resentment toward the one person at work who has the most control over your career . "" But Teach says it 's absolutely imperative to have a great work relationship with your boss "" because they control your destiny . "" "" You do n't have to love your boss but you need to be able to work well with them . One of the main reasons employees leave their job is because of their boss . A troubled relationship with your boss can negatively affect your morale , your productivity , your happiness , and of course , your career . A positive relationship can improve your morale , productivity and happiness which could lead to more career success in the form of promotions , raises and higher self-esteem . "" Maroney says a "" strong relationship "" may mean different things to different people , but what she has seen again and again is that "" it 's important to manage your relationship with your boss if you expect to prosper in a job . "" Here 's how to strengthen your relationship with your boss : Put yourself in your boss's shoes . Figure out the challenges your boss will encounter that day and be prepared to offer solutions , Mazur suggests . "" Anticipate the questions that your supervisor may ask about your work or a project and have thoughtful answers or next steps for them to take . Thinking ahead can really show that you 're an invaluable team member . "" Teach says it 's easy to be resentful of your boss , especially if they treat you a certain way , "" but they have a job to do , just like you , "" he explains . "" There 's a lot about their job that you do n't know about or see , so do n't assume that they 're out to get you , "" he adds . "" Sometimes they act a certain way for a reason – perhaps their boss is putting a lot of pressure on them – so try to be understanding . "" Show value . "" They hired you for a reason , so make sure that you 're adding value to the organization and / or position , "" Hockett says . "" Bosses want employees not only to agree with them , but also be willing to speak up about the realities and challenges in the business that need to be addressed . Be the person that speaks with facts , confidence and reasonable suggestions that produce results . This builds your boss's confidence in you . "" How did you choose your profession ? Did you pick a job that you thought would be easy ? Or lucrative ? Or glamorous ? Or , did you pursue a career related to your interests and hobbies ? Chances are , you did n't base your decision on the latter – but you probably should have . Why ? Hobbies are the things you choose to do ; activities that you 're probably good at and enjoy doing , and these personal expressions "" will give us unedited clues as to our real desires and interests , "" says Joyce K. Reynolds , an expert business coach . She says looking for career clues in one's choice of hobbies , interests and vocational activities will provide the most fruitful direction for highly successful career choices . "" In fact , the earlier we are able to observe our personal tastes as they show up in hobbies and outside activities , the more powerful a lead these things will provide in steering us to meaningful professional and career choices . "" Career coach Phyllis Mufson agrees . "" A hobby you really enjoy can be an important part of choosing a career because your hobby is a window into what you love and value and do most naturally , which are all important components of a career where you 'll flourish . "" While there can be tremendous joy in earning income from doing something that you might happily do for free , there are also practical benefits . "" It can be easier to segue into a hobby-related career since you may already have many of the skills , experiences and personal connections needed for success , "" says Nancy Collamer , a career coach at MyLifestyleCareer.com . But you need to spend time seriously evaluating whether turning your hobby into your work is a good idea , she adds . "" Sometimes it 's best to leave the two as separate and distinct parts of your life . "" Here are a few ways to monetize a hobby : Teach others to do what you love . Teach piano lessons , offer cooking classes , or teach another language , if those are your passions . You can do this by teaching through a college or continuing education program , by creating your own classes , or by creating your own webinars or tele-seminar series online , Collamer says . Sell / import / invent / craft a product or accessory for enthusiasts in your hobby . For example , if you are a wine enthusiast , you might import hand-blown wine glasses from a different country , or invent a unique wine refrigeration device , or develop a line of fun wine-themed T-shirts . "" Hobbyists tend to be very enthusiastic , passionate and willing to spend money on items related to their hobby , "" Collamer says . "" Just think of what baseball enthusiasts are willing to pay for World Series tickets . "" Teach the business of the hobby . "" I actually talk about this in my book ( Second-Act Careers : 50 + Ways to Profit From Your Passions During Semi-Retirement ) , using an example of a man who used to work for Microsoft in marketing , but his hobby was magic , and now he teaches marketing to magicians , "" Collamer says . So let 's say your background is in publishing , but you love cooking , you could specialize in teaching people in the food industry how to get their cookbooks published . "" I have another example in my book of a woman who teaches people how to make a living importing goods from Ecuador , for people who love to travel and / or shop . "" Speak or write about your hobby . Hobby related how-to topics , historical perspectives , and compelling stories , are all of interest to enthusiasts , Collamer says . And you could get paid to do it . Create a tour or performance series around what you love . "" The other day I met a woman who bills herself as a ' Founding Fathers Fanatic ' and she performs at schools , in character , to teach students about the Founding Fathers , "" Collamer says . "" Another example of this is Tony Mula , who turned his love of pizza and Brooklyn into the highly successful ' A Slice of Brooklyn ' pizza tours , "" she adds . "" I also know of a bike enthusiast who runs bike tours in California . "" Appraise , repair or fix items related to what you love . Most hobbies have "" stuff "" connected to them , and sometimes , that stuff needs to be fixed by a skilled and knowledgeable person . "" You could fix computers , appraise collectibles , repair bicycles , source missing parts for highly unusual items , and so on , "" Collamer says . "" The next time you find yourself confused as to how to generate income from your hobbies , search out the most successful entrepreneurs in your area of interest and study their business models and revenue streams , "" Collamer suggests . "" Ask yourself : Is their income coming from consulting services , videos , accessories , events , classes or product sales ? What is their mix of products and services ? What is their pricing strategy ? "" In doing this , you 'll discover proven models for monetizing your hobbies , as well as helpful information about how to price your own services and products . Mufson , who has interests outside of career coaching , says she managed to turn a hobby into a lucrative part-time gig . "" I personally turned my hobby of creating gemstone jewelry into a side-line business , "" she explains . "" Jewelry making is an expensive hobby and early on I decided to make it pay for itself . Since then I have developed two online stores and a relationship with a jewelry gallery that sells most of my work . "" Not everyone is going to wind up a star by following a well-loved hobby into a professional setting , Reynolds says . "" We ca n't all be Olympic skaters , NBA top scorers or real estate moguls . However , it can be taken as a promise that , if we follow the lines and design of our natural interests and loves , we will give ourselves the very best chance to grow into the most successful human beings we can be . It will also ensure that we have more days we love because we 're doing the things that most interest us , nourish us , and give us expression , "" she concludes . There are a few problems with the Tourism Authority of Thailand 4-page brochure mainly that they neglected to also publish this document in the Thai language since most of the offenses listed are committed by Thais and not by foreigners . The problem with the Tourism Authority of Thailand brochure for Chinese and Western tourists is that it has errors , assumes Thailand is Singapore , and only expects tourists to obey the rules – not local Thais . Right off the bat , the Tourism Authority of Thailand pamphlet tells us that smoking is allowed in all of Thailand's International Airports . The International Airports in Thailand have designated smoking areas – outside . At Suvarnabhumi International Airport in Bangkok , one has to cross the street and go to a designated area or face a 2,000 baht fine . I guess the Tourism Authority of Thailand is trying to help the cigarette-butt police increase their daily take . What the Tourism Authority of Thailand fails to mention is that if you get into a confrontation with a Thai , he will most likely get 10 of his buddies to come and beat the shit out of you . Failing that , he will pull a gun and shoot you . Tourism Authority of Thailand Counterfeits The Tourism Authority of Thailand also does n't tell you that you can buy your pornographic materials right out in the open on Sukhumvit Road . Dildos , XXX videos , and fake / real Viagra are readily available . All sorts of copyright material are also available . Tourism Authority of Thailand Loud Yes , Thais are soft-spoken except when they are drunk . They can also be quite noisy if handed a microphone especially when butchering karaoke songs . Tourism Authority of Thailand Proper Attire The Tourism Authority of Thailand also fails to point out , like Tom at Isaan-Live has done numerous times , that the biggest violators are Thai women . Tourism Authority of Thailand Spitting Yes , it is disgusting . For some reason the Tourism Authority of Thailand thinks this is Singapore where people get caned for spitting . But , no this is Thailand where at times it seems like the national pastime is spitting – and no one gets caned . Tourism Authority of Thailand Driving Safety I saved the best for last . The Tourism Authority of Thailand fails to mention that Thais are some of the worst drivers in the world , traffic laws are not followed , and the Thai Police selectively enforce laws . But , maybe since Chiang Mai targets foreign drivers these silly rules should be followed by tourists – after all – they are not followed by most Thais . Let 's take a look at them one by one : Drive safely in Thailand and strictly follow all traffic regulations . Yes , do n't do like Thai drivers and disobey every driving rule there is . Thailand adopts left-hand drive system . Always keep to the left lane when driving in Thailand . Actually , it should be that slower moving traffic stick to the left lane and only pass on the right . The Tourism Authority of Thailand does n't tell you that you can drive like a Thai and cross double yellow lines , pass on a hill , and drive at any speed you want . Always beware of bicycles and motorbikes as there are many on the roads . The Tourism Authority of Thailand fails to warn foreigners that Thais like to drive their motorcycles on the wrong side of the road and also like to drive on the sidewalks / footpaths . To prevent accidents , do not stop your car abruptly in the middle of a road for any reason . Unless you are Thai – then it is OK . If you are Thai , you can also stop in front of 7-11 or an ATM machine and block one lane of traffic as long as you put on one turn signal indicator . Please study the directions before each journey to make sure you know your way . And , do n't use any guidebooks from the Tourism Authority of Thailand unless you plan on getting lost . Always stop at zebra crossings to allow all pedestrians to cross the road first . The Tourism Authority of Thailand should warn people that zebra crossings / pedestrian crossing sare simply lines painted on the road that are ignored by all Thai drivers . If you stop for pedestrians in the crossing , be prepared to be rammed from the back . The rest of the list from the Tourism Authority of Thailand only pertain to those that bring vehicles into Thailand from foreign countries so it is of no value at all for Chinese / Western tourists and will most likely just confuse people . This just goes to show that the Tourism Authority of Thailand is clueless when it comes to foreign tourists and needs to focus some of its energy on cleaning up Thailand or tourists will stop visiting . One of the most important hiring criteria for many companies is the ability to work as a team player – yet , so many of us have colleagues who do n't play well with others . "" If you have one bad apple in the bunch , it can really hurt the morale and enthusiasm of an entire department , "" says Andy Teach , author of From Graduation to Corporation , and host of the YouTube channel FromGradToCorp . "" A department , or company , that works well together , has the most success together . When you enjoy working with your colleagues and look forward to interacting with them , everyone benefits . "" Working with other team members whom you have a great work relationship with can actually make work fun , he says . "" Morale is high , which leads to better productivity , which leads to better results . "" Skip Weisman , a leadership and workplace communication expert , agrees . "" A high-morale work environment will always produce more than a low-morale work environment . "" When people care about the people they work with , things get done faster , he says . "" People will go the extra mile ; they will take ownership of a job , a decision or problem and work through it without feeling like they have to go up the chain to get things done . "" Another benefit of colleagues working well together : Information flows more freely , says David Parnell , a legal consultant , communication coach and author . "" In addition , the group 's well being and success become more of a priority ; patience , generosity and a gravitation toward interaction grows ; and good moods and dynamic information beget better moods and even more dynamic information , "" he says . "" All of this conspires to create a more balanced , functional , aggressive and successful company . "" So , what happens when colleagues do n't work well together ? Parnell says time and cognitive bandwidth is wasted "" exercising restraint , measuring words and otherwise forcing hands to play nicely in the sandbox . "" The outcome is shoddy workmanship , pushed or missed deadlines and severe lacerations to the company culture or your group's sub-culture . Deborah Shane , a career author , writer , speaker and professional branding and social media marketing strategist , adds that a bad workplace relationship creates negative energy , which can affect everyone on the team , as well as customers or clients . It can also cause employee turnover , which "" interrupts building and creating a strong , unified team . "" Finally , she says , "" conflict fosters cliques and factions within a team that always works against it . "" Make teamwork a priority by making it part of the performance management system . This begins with performance expectations when someone joins the organization , Weisman says . "" I was speaking with a prospective client last summer who was complaining about this very thing – that their people were not working well together – so I asked her , ' Well , do you assess their contribution to teamwork as part of your annual performance review process ? ' She looked at me like a deer in headlights and responded as if it was a master stroke of genius . "" If you do n't measure it and give people the expectation at the very beginning of their role with the organization , it will not be seen as priority . Pinpoint the issue . "" Explore your feelings and behavior toward your colleagues , "" says Parnell . "" Social and professional relationships are inextricably symbiotic and interactive , and much of the communication that occurs is both subconscious and reactive . "" If your colleagues seem to be difficult , they may actually be reacting to the signals you are giving off – whether consciously or unconsciously . While this might be a bitter pill to swallow , you may be the very root of the problem and the first step toward recovery is discovering this . Think you deserve a bigger paycheck ? Want to ask for a raise but not sure you 'll get one ? Plenty of employees are finding themselves in this predicament , because many recession-wary companies that stopped handing out raises during the economic downturn are still hesitant to open their wallets today . But career experts say that despite all the penny-pinching , a salary hike is n't necessarily out of the question – so you might as well ask . "" Clearly most companies today are not looking for opportunities to hand out money , "" says Lynn Taylor , a national workplace expert and author of Tame Your Terrible Office Tyrant ; How to Manage Childish Boss Behavior and Thrive in Your Job . "" During the boom era of the late '90s when talent was scarce and retention was top of mind , nearly the opposite was true . While the corporate landscape is different now , you should n't sit idly and feel dissatisfied in silence . If you have supportive evidence your salary is at sub-market levels , you should speak up . "" She says it is possible to get a raise , even in an environment where money is n't exactly falling from trees . "" Your organization has invested time and money in you . Savvy bosses understand that unhappy and underpaid employees are under-performing employees , which helps no one . It 's a drain on their time to have to re-hire and train a replacement that fits the corporate culture . So if you have a legitimate request , you do have a certain amount of leverage . "" Connie Thanasoulis-Cerrachio , a career expert and co-founder of SixFigureStart , a career coaching firm , agrees . "" I think it 's always a good idea to ask for a raise , even when employers are not handing them out , "" she says . "" But only when that discussion is tied to performance . "" Employees should keep careful records of how their actions helped the bottom line of their company , or helped other team members improve the bottom line of the company , she suggests . "" No one is going to hold your hand and remind you of the great things you did all year , "" she adds , so keep track and share them with your manager at the appropriate time . Asking for a pay raise is a delicate conversation and something you should not do without careful planning , says Dr. Katharine Brooks , executive director of the office of personal and career development at Wake Forest University and author of You Majored in What ? Mapping Your Path from Chaos to Career . "" Being prepared can help you overcome your hesitation . "" Aside from keeping track of your accomplishments and contributions , you can plan by thinking about things like timing . "" This is key , "" Brooks says . "" If others are being laid off , or there has been a cutback in revenues to the organization , that is generally not the time to ask for a raise . Wait for things to settle , then assess the situation . Perhaps you are now doing the work of two former workers , or you have brought in more revenue than in previous years . Wait until you can approach from a positive rather than negative stance . "" Know your value . Do the proper research to figure out what you 're worth , even if it means going on interviews or using resources like Getraised.com , Payscale.com , or Glassdoor.com , says Thanasoulis-Cerrachio . If you find out you 're underpaid , you can use that to negotiate an increase . "" Look at salary surveys , cost-of-living comparisons , and rates of compensation within your organization , if possible , "" Brooks says . "" If you are aware that colleagues are earning more than you , tread carefully . You do n't want to put others in a negative light or violate a corporate written or unwritten rule about knowing what others earn . Simply present what the field generally pays , and why you believe your performance is at the top of your field . "" Know the number . Once you do the research , figure out what you think is a fair amount of money to ask for , says Thanasoulis-Cerrachio . "" Have that number in your head when you ask for a raise . "" Schedule a meeting . Find a time that works best for you and your boss , Thanasoulis-Cerrachio says . Taylor adds , "" Give your boss a head 's up that you want to chat about your career growth so that you both have ample time . "" Practice salary negotiations . This can be a difficult or awkward conversation . Practice with a friend who can be a tough negotiator , Thanasoulis-Cerrachio says . We all have our moments of "" multitask overload "" – especially managers . But working with a perpetually disorganized boss can be exasperating and even detrimental to your workplace productivity . "" You may feel like you 're spinning your wheels , "" says Lynn Taylor , a national workplace expert and author of Tame Your Terrible Office Tyrant ; How to Manage Childish Boss Behavior and Thrive in Your Job . "" There can be many false starts if your boss has n't thought through a project or the resources required for it ; if he has n't set priorities well ; or if he ca n't get back to you because everything appears to be in disarray . And if you follow orders based on a disorganized initiative , a chaotic domino effect can occur within your department . "" This work style can negatively affect your sense of accomplishment and performance , she adds . "" And it can bring down an entire team . "" Sara Sutton Fell , CEO and founder of FlexJobs , agrees . "" It can be extremely frustrating to deal with a disorganized boss , because their disorganization often trickles ( or even pours ) down on you . It can hurt team morale , and it reflects poorly on everyone . "" When the boss is disorganized , it can lead to partial project requests , misinformation , missed or wrong deadlines and "" general messiness , "" she says . "" All of those can cause balls to be dropped , and then ensuing stress and rush to pick them back up again . "" Katharine Brooks , executive director of the office of personal and career development at Wake Forest University and author of You Majored in What ? Mapping Your Path from Chaos to Career , says the word "" disorganized "" can mean several things . "" It could be a failure to see the big picture and approach issues strategically ; difficulty remembering important deadlines , meetings , projects , etc. ; or failure to set goals and prioritize what is important for the office . "" Productivity coach Casey Moore concurs . She says in the workplace , "" disorganization "" takes many forms . One , she says , is what she calls "" the searcher . "" "" This supervisor ca n't find the objects or information she needs when she needs them . She frequently wastes time looking for keys , emails , digital files , etc. – and she wastes money replacing lost items and wastes energy ( and more time ) re-creating documents or other work products . She usually has a cluttered desk and email inbox , "" explains Moore , the author of Stop Organizing , Start Producing . "" You and your colleagues will likely be dragged into time-consuming searches or scrambles to re-do or replace what is n't found . You may have to exercise caution about what you give your supervisor because it may be lost and / or forgotten . "" "" The improviser "" is another type of disorganized boss . This supervisor does n't plan ahead . He may be adept at reacting and improvising on the spot , but eventually you realizes he 's covering his tracks , not blazing a trail , Moore says . "" He requires his team to reinvent the wheel over and over because there 's no time to fine-tune processes when you 're always behind the curve . "" If this is your boss , you and your colleagues likely perform too many fire drills : rushing to meet deadlines , struggling to fix easily-preventable mistakes , and missing out on opportunities that require a modicum of foresight . Moore says the third type of disorganized supervisor is "" the constrictor . "" This boss does n't delegate , she says . "" Her reasons vary from altruist ( ' protecting ' her team ) to arrogant ( only she can do it ' right ' ) ; from fearful ( of letting go ) to flummoxed ( unable to identify exactly how others could help ) . The result , however , is always the same : a bottleneck that slows everyone . "" This type of boss's subordinates probably feel frustrated by her unresponsiveness , the lack of challenging goals and the subtle implication that she does n't think you they handle the work , Moore adds . Do you have a coworker who thinks he knows everything ? He believes he 's the go-to person ; the one with the special connections and authority . He acts as though he 's been everywhere and has experienced everything . If there 's a problem , he has the solution ; if there 's a question , he has the answer . He is n't open to new ideas or collaborating – and he has strong opinions , which he delivers in an obnoxious manner . Chances are , you 've never , ever heard him utter the words "" I do n't know . "" "" They tend to monopolize conversations , dismiss input from others and make decisions without first considering all the facts , "" she says . "" A ' my way or the highway ' attitude often leads to unhappy coworkers , disgruntled clients , and an unhappy work environment . "" Andrew G. Rosen , founder and editor of career advice blog Jobacle.com , says it can be extremely difficult to work with a know-it-all because "" they are generally poor listeners , often thinking about what they are going to say next rather than hear what you are saying . Their mindset makes it hard to get through to them that their idea or solution might not be the best one . They have often already formed an opinion and will not be swayed . "" Michael Kerr , an international business speaker , president of Humor at Work , and author of The Humor Advantage : Why Some Businesses are Laughing all the Way to the Bank ( Dec. 2013 ) , agrees . "" Know-it-alls can be extremely frustrating to work with for a number of reasons , "" he says . "" One , they tend to speak more than they listen , so people can be left with the feeling that their opinions or ideas have n't been given a proper hearing . They can often be close-minded as well – which means they can become a severe impediment to the creative process by blocking any idea other than their own . They simply know an idea either will or wo n't work . Some know-it-alls can come across as opinionated , aggressive , brusque and even loud – all traits that wo n't win over a lot of people at the office – and in fact can be easily construed as bullying behavior . "" Here are eight tips for dealing with a know-it-all coworker : 1 . Be empathetic . This coworker may irritate you – but remember that his or her know-it-all attitude is probably stemming from a confidence issue or some deeper personal issue , Rosen says . "" Rather than get angry , allow yourself to be empathetic . "" 2 . Pick your battles . "" Dealing with a know-it-all can be exhausting and there are times when your best response is to ignore their ' helpful ' hints as much as possible , "" Collamer says . "" Deflect their comments with a simple , ' Thanks for that suggestion ' instead of engaging them in an ongoing conversation . "" 3 . Lead by example . "" A boss or manager , especially , needs to model the behavior that in many circumstances it 's not only okay to not know everything , it 's encouraged , "" Kerr says . "" Saying ' I do n't know , but let 's find some answers or get some great ideas ' demonstrates that you are flexible and open to other opinions . Saying ' I do n't know , ' can also build trust by demonstrating openness , vulnerability and honesty . "" 4 . Be armed with your own facts . If you are delivering a presentation , selling an idea or heading into a meeting , be confident in your own facts , Kerr says . "" Double check your sources and verify the facts . The more armed you are with knowledge , the less chance the know-it-all has to interject or one up you . "" When in meetings , stick to an agenda ( passed around ahead of time ) that provides a set amount of time for each person to speak , Collamer adds . "" Come prepared with facts and statistics in writing , so in the event ' Mr. Know-it-all ' does n't let you get a word in edgewise , you have something in writing to share with the team . The better prepared you are , the less room there will be for the know-it-all to commandeer the discussion . "" "" Although it 's highly tempting to use sarcasm with a know-it-all , this will undoubtedly backfire . Instead , take a deep breath , smile and do your best Johnny Carson impersonation , ' I did not know that . That is weird , wild stuff . ' Laugh it off by reminding yourself that often their behavior is harmless and they do n't really mean anything by it . A friendly , ' Okay , I want you on my Trivial Pursuit team ' can disarm a potentially tense situation . "" 6 . Ask probing questions . Be respectful , but ask detailed question to peel back the layers of a know-it-all's stance , Kerr suggests . "" Ask why they believe something to be true or where they found their sources , "" he says . "" Asking pointed questions on specific details can teach a know-it-all over time that they need to have their facts in order before speaking out . "" 7 . Take the person aside and offer constructive feedback on their behavior . "" Recognize that it 's possible that Ms. Know-it-all may be clueless about the impact of her behavior on others , "" Collamer says . "" If you suspect that 's the case , consider gently pointing this out during a private discussion away from the office . "" Kerr adds : "" Although this can be tricky , if you do it in a respectful way it can help . Keep in mind that many know-it-alls may be highly insecure , so stroke their ego , flatter them on their range of knowledge , but caution them as to how their communication style may be coming across to other people . "" Remind them how important it is for less confident people than themselves to be able to speak up . 8 . Avoid involving your boss unless the know-it-all is truly threatening your success . "" If that becomes necessary , maintain a positive tone and instead of complaining about the person , focus on what you 're willing to do to make sure the work is done well , "" says Isa Adney , author of How to Get a Job Without a Resume and the blog firstjoboutofcollege.com . Collamer agrees . "" If the situation really becomes unbearable , talk it over with your boss and let him or her know how the know-it-all's behavior is impacting the team and work environment . "" Any new entrepreneur can become quickly overwhelmed by the amount of paperwork involved in running a business . A business owner has to be concerned about record-keeping requirements for tax purposes , client contact notes , marketing schedules , and billing , while still trying to meet the day-to-day needs of running a business . Try to be as paper-free as possible . This saves money and storage costs , and does n't tie you down to a desk . One advantage of being new is that you can start from the beginning with everything . It is difficult to try to get organized once your business is established . Take some time to consider some online options that will cut down on paperwork and get your office on track right from the very start . Here are five tips that can help : Dropbox : This free online service lets you bring your photos , documents , and videos anywhere and share them easily . Just start an account to install the Dropbox application on your computer . Then you simply create and share folders to exchange information with other people . Also use Dropbox to store your own files so they are available wherever you go . Join . me : Join . me offers free screen sharing and online meetings . Share your computer screen to go over any documents when you have telephone appointments with clients . Money Issues : Being in business requires you to become a good money manager . You must keep your financial commitments and be tenacious about accounts receivable . Whenever possible , have clients pay for as much work upfront as possible . If any amount is due , use scheduling reminders to send a reminder invoice . As your business grows , you might begin using QuickBooks or PayPal to help in collecting and sending money . Authorize . Net is another online payment solution , where clients receive a link via email and access the site to pay by credit or debit card . Tax Issues : Depending on your business you could be responsible for federal and state income tax , social security payments , sales tax , and other tax responsibilities . Consult a local accountant , tax advisor , tax authority , or Small Business Administration office to find out what taxes you are responsible for as a small business owner . A Little Now Saves A Lot Later It 's never too early for high school students to start checking out colleges on their list of potential schools . A campus tour is not only a great way for students to find places they love , but also to cross off those on their list that may not be the right fit . A college may look great in a brochure or say all the right things on its website , but the true test of fit often comes from a personal visit . Of course , several things can make or break a college tour . For example , students who visit during the summer or over breaks may not have the same experience as those who attend information sessions and tours during the fall or spring semesters . To ensure students have a successful college tour , I suggest the following tips . 1 . Explore Online Before students head to any campus , it 's a good idea to do a little reconnaissance . Students should check the college's website to verify the school offers the degree programs they may be interested in , as well as study abroad or research opportunities ( if desired ) . Students may want to browse the student activities page and see what clubs , organizations and groups may be present on campus , as well . It 's not a bad idea to check if any events ( sporting , concert , etc. ) will be held during the tour date , as there could be issues with parking or areas of the campus that are inaccessible at that time . Students should definitely familiarize themselves with the admissions and financial aid pages , too . After carefully reviewing the college's website , students should write down any questions they might have and bring these with them during the tour . 2 . Make Appointments Although some schools may have informal , walk-in tours available , most of the larger schools will require an appointment for students to participate in an admissions session and / or campus tour . This means students will need to go online or call weeks ( or even months ) in advance to secure their spot . Depending on the time of year , some schools may even limit the number of high school underclassmen allowed , saving those precious spaces for graduating seniors who will be attending next fall . Seniors should not only participate in an admissions session and tour , but also consider scheduling an interview with an admissions counselor , and possibly meeting with the department chairs or professors within their chosen degree field . Juniors , who tour during the spring or summer before senior year , should also consider going through the interview process . 3 . Roam Freely Campus tours are a great way to get a feel for a school , but students should remember that tours are geared to show them the best the college has to offer . To see what a college may be like on an average day , students should opt to roam on their own for a few hours before or after their tour . It 's a good idea for them to have a meal at the cafeteria ( they 'll be eating there quite a lot , if accepted ) , sit in on a class ( big and small ) , or chat up some students that are hanging out on campus . If possible , students should also spend some time exploring the surrounding community , or consider participating in an overnight stay , to see if it the college is a good match . It 's helpful if students bring along a campus scorecard to keep track of things they like ( or dislike ) during their tours , as campuses can start to blend together after a few visits . Students should pay attention to various things , such as dorm room sizes and options , typical class size , how many students stay after their first year and how many graduate on time , as well as other things that may play a role in their decision to apply . Once students have narrowed their lists , sent in their college applications , and received their acceptance letters , a second trip may be needed to help them make a final decision . A picture may speak a thousand words , but a campus visit is the best way for students to see themselves in that picture . </doc>

1527,A7,"Freshness How recently an egg was laid has a bearing on its freshness but is only one of many factors . The temperature and humidity level at which the egg is held play their parts as well . These variables are so important that an egg one week old , held under ideal conditions , can be fresher than an egg left at room temperature for one day . The ideal conditions for egg storage are temperatures between 35 and 40oF ( 2o to 4oC ) and a relative humidity of 70 to 80 % . Proper handling means promptly gathering and washing the eggs within a few hours after they 've been laid . Most commercially produced eggs reach supermarkets within a few days of leaving the laying house . If you and your market handle eggs properly , they 'll still be fresh when they reach the table . It 's a misconception that you can judge freshness by placing an egg in salt water . A carefully controlled brine test is sometimes used to judge shell thickness of eggs for hatching purposes but the test has no application to freshness of table eggs . How important is freshness ? As an egg ages , the white becomes thinner , the yolk becomes flatter and the yolk membrane becomes weaker . These changes do n't have any great effect on the nutritional quality of the egg or its functional cooking properties in recipes . Appearance may be affected though . When poached or fried , the fresher the egg , the more it will hold its shape rather than spread out in the pan . However , if you hard-boil eggs that are at least a week old , you 'll find them easier to peel than fresher eggs . The stronger the yolk membrane , the less likely the yolk will break inadvertently . </doc>

46,A4,"FATHER GORIOT To the great and illustrious Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire , a token of admiration for his works and genius . DE BALZAC . FATHER GORIOT Mme . Vauquer ( _nee_ de Conflans ) is an elderly person , who for the past forty years has kept a lodging-house in the Rue Nueve-Sainte-Genevieve , in the district that lies between the Latin Quarter and the Faubourg Saint-Marcel . Her house ( known in the neighborhood as the _Maison Vauquer_ ) receives men and women , old and young , and no word has ever been breathed against her respectable establishment ; but , at the same time , it must be said that as a matter of fact no young woman has been under her roof for thirty years , and that if a young man stays there for any length of time it is a sure sign that his allowance must be of the slenderest . In 1819 , however , the time when this drama opens , there was an almost penniless young girl among Mme . Vauquer's boarders . That word drama has been somewhat discredited of late ; it has been overworked and twisted to strange uses in these days of dolorous literature ; but it must do service again here , not because this story is dramatic in the restricted sense of the word , but because some tears may perhaps be shed _intra et extra muros_ before it is over . Will any one without the walls of Paris understand it ? It is open to doubt . The only audience who could appreciate the results of close observation , the careful reproduction of minute detail and local color , are dwellers between the heights of Montrouge and Montmartre , in a vale of crumbling stucco watered by streams of black mud , a vale of sorrows which are real and joys too often hollow ; but this audience is so accustomed to terrible sensations , that only some unimaginable and well-neigh impossible woe could produce any lasting impression there . Now and again there are tragedies so awful and so grand by reason of the complication of virtues and vices that bring them about , that egotism and selfishness are forced to pause and are moved to pity ; but the impression that they receive is like a luscious fruit , soon consumed . Civilization , like the car of Juggernaut , is scarcely stayed perceptibly in its progress by a heart less easy to break than the others that lie in its course ; this also is broken , and Civilization continues on her course triumphant . And you , too , will do the like ; you who with this book in your white hand will sink back among the cushions of your armchair , and say to yourself , "" Perhaps this may amuse me . "" You will read the story of Father Goriot's secret woes , and , dining thereafter with an unspoiled appetite , will lay the blame of your insensibility upon the writer , and accuse him of exaggeration , of writing romances . Ah ! once for all , this drama is neither a fiction nor a romance ! _All is true_ , -- so true , that every one can discern the elements of the tragedy in his own house , perhaps in his own heart . The lodging-house is Mme . Vauquer's own property . It is still standing in the lower end of the Rue Nueve-Sainte-Genevieve , just where the road slopes so sharply down to the Rue de l ' Arbalete , that wheeled traffic seldom passes that way , because it is so stony and steep . This position is sufficient to account for the silence prevalent in the streets shut in between the dome of the Pantheon and the dome of the Val-de-Grace , two conspicuous public buildings which give a yellowish tone to the landscape and darken the whole district that lies beneath the shadow of their leaden-hued cupolas . In that district the pavements are clean and dry , there is neither mud nor water in the gutters , grass grows in the chinks of the walls . The most heedless passer-by feels the depressing influences of a place where the sound of wheels creates a sensation ; there is a grim look about the houses , a suggestion of a jail about those high garden walls . A Parisian straying into a suburb apparently composed of lodging-houses and public institutions would see poverty and dullness , old age lying down to die , and joyous youth condemned to drudgery . It is the ugliest quarter of Paris , and , it may be added , the least known . But , before all things , the Rue Nueve-Sainte-Genevieve is like a bronze frame for a picture for which the mind can not be too well prepared by the contemplation of sad hues and sober images . Even so , step by step the daylight decreases , and the cicerone's droning voice grows hollower as the traveler descends into the Catacombs . The comparison holds good ! Who shall say which is more ghastly , the sight of the bleached skulls or of dried-up human hearts ? The front of the lodging-house is at right angles to the road , and looks out upon a little garden , so that you see the side of the house in section , as it were , from the Rue Nueve-Sainte-Genevieve . Beneath the wall of the house front there lies a channel , a fathom wide , paved with cobble-stones , and beside it runs a graveled walk bordered by geraniums and oleanders and pomegranates set in great blue and white glazed earthenware pots . Access into the graveled walk is afforded by a door , above which the words MAISON VAUQUER may be read , and beneath , in rather smaller letters , "" _Lodgings for both sexes , etc. _ "" During the day a glimpse into the garden is easily obtained through a wicket to which a bell is attached . On the opposite wall , at the further end of the graveled walk , a green marble arch was painted once upon a time by a local artist , and in this semblance of a shrine a statue representing Cupid is installed ; a Parisian Cupid , so blistered and disfigured that he looks like a candidate for one of the adjacent hospitals , and might suggest an allegory to lovers of symbolism . The half-obliterated inscription on the pedestal beneath determines the date of this work of art , for it bears witness to the widespread enthusiasm felt for Voltaire on his return to Paris in 1777 : "" Whoe ' er thou art , thy master see ; He is , or was , or ought to be . "" At night the wicket gate is replaced by a solid door . The little garden is no wider than the front of the house ; it is shut in between the wall of the street and the partition wall of the neighboring house . A mantle of ivy conceals the bricks and attracts the eyes of passers-by to an effect which is picturesque in Paris , for each of the walls is covered with trellised vines that yield a scanty dusty crop of fruit , and furnish besides a subject of conversation for Mme . Vauquer and her lodgers ; every year the widow trembles for her vintage . A straight path beneath the walls on either side of the garden leads to a clump of lime-trees at the further end of it ; _line_-trees , as Mme . Vauquer persists in calling them , in spite of the fact that she was a de Conflans , and regardless of repeated corrections from her lodgers . The central space between the walls is filled with artichokes and rows of pyramid fruit-trees , and surrounded by a border of lettuce , pot-herbs , and parsley . Under the lime-trees there are a few green-painted garden seats and a wooden table , and hither , during the dog-days , such of the lodgers as are rich enough to indulge in a cup of coffee come to take their pleasure , though it is hot enough to roast eggs even in the shade . The house itself is three stories high , without counting the attics under the roof . It is built of rough stone , and covered with the yellowish stucco that gives a mean appearance to almost every house in Paris . There are five windows in each story in the front of the house ; all the blinds visible through the small square panes are drawn up awry , so that the lines are all at cross purposes . At the side of the house there are but two windows on each floor , and the lowest of all are adorned with a heavy iron grating . Behind the house a yard extends for some twenty feet , a space inhabited by a happy family of pigs , poultry , and rabbits ; the wood-shed is situated on the further side , and on the wall between the wood-shed and the kitchen window hangs the meat-safe , just above the place where the sink discharges its greasy streams . The cook sweeps all the refuse out through a little door into the Rue Nueve-Sainte-Genevieve , and frequently cleanses the yard with copious supplies of water , under pain of pestilence . The house might have been built on purpose for its present uses . Access is given by a French window to the first room on the ground floor , a sitting-room which looks out upon the street through the two barred windows already mentioned . Another door opens out of it into the dining-room , which is separated from the kitchen by the well of the staircase , the steps being constructed partly of wood , partly of tiles , which are colored and beeswaxed . Nothing can be more depressing than the sight of that sitting-room . The furniture is covered with horse hair woven in alternate dull and glossy stripes . There is a round table in the middle , with a purplish-red marble top , on which there stands , by way of ornament , the inevitable white china tea-service , covered with a half-effaced gilt network . The floor is sufficiently uneven , the wainscot rises to elbow height , and the rest of the wall space is decorated with a varnished paper , on which the principal scenes from _Telemaque_ are depicted , the various classical personages being colored . The subject between the two windows is the banquet given by Calypso to the son of Ulysses , displayed thereon for the admiration of the boarders , and has furnished jokes these forty years to the young men who show themselves superior to their position by making fun of the dinners to which poverty condemns them . The hearth is always so clean and neat that it is evident that a fire is only kindled there on great occasions ; the stone chimney-piece is adorned by a couple of vases filled with faded artificial flowers imprisoned under glass shades , on either side of a bluish marble clock in the very worst taste . The first room exhales an odor for which there is no name in the language , and which should be called the _odeur de pension_ . The damp atmosphere sends a chill through you as you breathe it ; it has a stuffy , musty , and rancid quality ; it permeates your clothing ; after-dinner scents seem to be mingled in it with smells from the kitchen and scullery and the reek of a hospital . It might be possible to describe it if some one should discover a process by which to distil from the atmosphere all the nauseating elements with which it is charged by the catarrhal exhalations of every individual lodger , young or old . Yet , in spite of these stale horrors , the sitting-room is as charming and as delicately perfumed as a boudoir , when compared with the adjoining dining-room . The paneled walls of that apartment were once painted some color , now a matter of conjecture , for the surface is incrusted with accumulated layers of grimy deposit , which cover it with fantastic outlines . A collection of dim-ribbed glass decanters , metal discs with a satin sheen on them , and piles of blue-edged earthenware plates of Touraine ware cover the sticky surfaces of the sideboards that line the room . In a corner stands a box containing a set of numbered pigeon-holes , in which the lodgers' table napkins , more or less soiled and stained with wine , are kept . Here you see that indestructible furniture never met with elsewhere , which finds its way into lodging-houses much as the wrecks of our civilization drift into hospitals for incurables . You expect in such places as these to find the weather-house whence a Capuchin issues on wet days ; you look to find the execrable engravings which spoil your appetite , framed every one in a black varnished frame , with a gilt beading round it ; you know the sort of tortoise-shell clock-case , inlaid with brass ; the green stove , the Argand lamps , covered with oil and dust , have met your eyes before . The oilcloth which covers the long table is so greasy that a waggish _externe_ will write his name on the surface , using his thumb-nail as a style . The chairs are broken-down invalids ; the wretched little hempen mats slip away from under your feet without slipping away for good ; and finally , the foot-warmers are miserable wrecks , hingeless , charred , broken away about the holes . It would be impossible to give an idea of the old , rotten , shaky , cranky , worm-eaten , halt , maimed , one-eyed , rickety , and ramshackle condition of the furniture without an exhaustive description , which would delay the progress of the story to an extent that impatient people would not pardon . The red tiles of the floor are full of depressions brought about by scouring and periodical renewings of color . In short , there is no illusory grace left to the poverty that reigns here ; it is dire , parsimonious , concentrated , threadbare poverty ; as yet it has not sunk into the mire , it is only splashed by it , and though not in rags as yet , its clothing is ready to drop to pieces . This apartment is in all its glory at seven o ' clock in the morning , when Mme . Vauquer's cat appears , announcing the near approach of his mistress , and jumps upon the sideboards to sniff at the milk in the bowls , each protected by a plate , while he purrs his morning greeting to the world . A moment later the widow shows her face ; she is tricked out in a net cap attached to a false front set on awry , and shuffles into the room in her slipshod fashion . She is an oldish woman , with a bloated countenance , and a nose like a parrot's beak set in the middle of it ; her fat little hands ( she is as sleek as a church rat ) and her shapeless , slouching figure are in keeping with the room that reeks of misfortune , where hope is reduced to speculate for the meanest stakes . Mme . Vauquer alone can breathe that tainted air without being disheartened by it . Her face is as fresh as a frosty morning in autumn ; there are wrinkles about the eyes that vary in their expression from the set smile of a ballet-dancer to the dark , suspicious scowl of a discounter of bills ; in short , she is at once the embodiment and interpretation of her lodging-house , as surely as her lodging-house implies the existence of its mistress . You can no more imagine the one without the other , than you can think of a jail without a turnkey . The unwholesome corpulence of the little woman is produced by the life she leads , just as typhus fever is bred in the tainted air of a hospital . The very knitted woolen petticoat that she wears beneath a skirt made of an old gown , with the wadding protruding through the rents in the material , is a sort of epitome of the sitting-room , the dining-room , and the little garden ; it discovers the cook , it foreshadows the lodgers--the picture of the house is completed by the portrait of its mistress . Mme . Vauquer at the age of fifty is like all women who "" have seen a deal of trouble . "" She has the glassy eyes and innocent air of a trafficker in flesh and blood , who will wax virtuously indignant to obtain a higher price for her services , but who is quite ready to betray a Georges or a Pichegru , if a Georges or a Pichegru were in hiding and still to be betrayed , or for any other expedient that may alleviate her lot . Still , "" she is a good woman at bottom , "" said the lodgers who believed that the widow was wholly dependent upon the money that they paid her , and sympathized when they heard her cough and groan like one of themselves . What had M. Vauquer been ? The lady was never very explicit on this head . How had she lost her money ? "" Through trouble , "" was her answer . He had treated her badly , had left her nothing but her eyes to cry over his cruelty , the house she lived in , and the privilege of pitying nobody , because , so she was wont to say , she herself had been through every possible misfortune . Sylvie , the stout cook , hearing her mistress' shuffling footsteps , hastened to serve the lodgers' breakfasts . Beside those who lived in the house , Mme . Vauquer took boarders who came for their meals ; but these _externes_ usually only came to dinner , for which they paid thirty francs a month . At the time when this story begins , the lodging-house contained seven inmates . The best rooms in the house were on the first story , Mme . Vauquer herself occupying the least important , while the rest were let to a Mme . Couture , the widow of a commissary-general in the service of the Republic . With her lived Victorine Taillefer , a schoolgirl , to whom she filled the place of mother . These two ladies paid eighteen hundred francs a year . The two sets of rooms on the second floor were respectively occupied by an old man named Poiret and a man of forty or thereabouts , the wearer of a black wig and dyed whiskers , who gave out that he was a retired merchant , and was addressed as M. Vautrin . Two of the four rooms on the third floor were also let--one to an elderly spinster , a Mlle . Michonneau , and the other to a retired manufacturer of vermicelli , Italian paste and starch , who allowed the others to address him as "" Father Goriot . "" The remaining rooms were allotted to various birds of passage , to impecunious students , who like "" Father Goriot "" and Mlle . Michonneau , could only muster forty-five francs a month to pay for their board and lodging . Mme . Vauquer had little desire for lodgers of this sort ; they ate too much bread , and she only took them in default of better . At that time one of the rooms was tenanted by a law student , a young man from the neighborhood of Angouleme , one of a large family who pinched and starved themselves to spare twelve hundred francs a year for him . Misfortune had accustomed Eugene de Rastignac , for that was his name , to work . He belonged to the number of young men who know as children that their parents' hopes are centered on them , and deliberately prepare themselves for a great career , subordinating their studies from the first to this end , carefully watching the indications of the course of events , calculating the probable turn that affairs will take , that they may be the first to profit by them . But for his observant curiosity , and the skill with which he managed to introduce himself into the salons of Paris , this story would not have been colored by the tones of truth which it certainly owes to him , for they are entirely due to his penetrating sagacity and desire to fathom the mysteries of an appalling condition of things , which was concealed as carefully by the victim as by those who had brought it to pass . Above the third story there was a garret where the linen was hung to dry , and a couple of attics . Christophe , the man-of-all-work , slept in one , and Sylvie , the stout cook , in the other . Beside the seven inmates thus enumerated , taking one year with another , some eight law or medical students dined in the house , as well as two or three regular comers who lived in the neighborhood . There were usually eighteen people at dinner , and there was room , if need be , for twenty at Mme . Vauquer's table ; at breakfast , however , only the seven lodgers appeared . It was almost like a family party . Every one came down in dressing-gown and slippers , and the conversation usually turned on anything that had happened the evening before ; comments on the dress or appearance of the dinner contingent were exchanged in friendly confidence . These seven lodgers were Mme . Vauquer's spoiled children . Among them she distributed , with astronomical precision , the exact proportion of respect and attention due to the varying amounts they paid for their board . One single consideration influenced all these human beings thrown together by chance . The two second-floor lodgers only paid seventy-two francs a month . Such prices as these are confined to the Faubourg Saint-Marcel and the district between La Bourbe and the Salpetriere ; and , as might be expected , poverty , more or less apparent , weighed upon them all , Mme . Couture being the sole exception to the rule . The dreary surroundings were reflected in the costumes of the inmates of the house ; all were alike threadbare . The color of the men's coats were problematical ; such shoes , in more fashionable quarters , are only to be seen lying in the gutter ; the cuffs and collars were worn and frayed at the edges ; every limp article of clothing looked like the ghost of its former self . The women's dresses were faded , old-fashioned , dyed and re-dyed ; they wore gloves that were glazed with hard wear , much-mended lace , dingy ruffles , crumpled muslin fichus . So much for their clothing ; but , for the most part , their frames were solid enough ; their constitutions had weathered the storms of life ; their cold , hard faces were worn like coins that have been withdrawn from circulation , but there were greedy teeth behind the withered lips . Dramas brought to a close or still in progress are foreshadowed by the sight of such actors as these , not the dramas that are played before the footlights and against a background of painted canvas , but dumb dramas of life , frost-bound dramas that sere hearts like fire , dramas that do not end with the actors' lives . Mlle . Michonneau , that elderly young lady , screened her weak eyes from the daylight by a soiled green silk shade with a rim of brass , an object fit to scare away the Angel of Pity himself . Her shawl , with its scanty , draggled fringe , might have covered a skeleton , so meagre and angular was the form beneath it . Yet she must have been pretty and shapely once . What corrosive had destroyed the feminine outlines ? Was it trouble , or vice , or greed ? Had she loved too well ? Had she been a second-hand clothes dealer , a frequenter of the backstairs of great houses , or had she been merely a courtesan ? Was she expiating the flaunting triumphs of a youth overcrowded with pleasures by an old age in which she was shunned by every passer-by ? Her vacant gaze sent a chill through you ; her shriveled face seemed like a menace . Her voice was like the shrill , thin note of the grasshopper sounding from the thicket when winter is at hand . She said that she had nursed an old gentleman , ill of catarrh of the bladder , and left to die by his children , who thought that he had nothing left . His bequest to her , a life annuity of a thousand francs , was periodically disputed by his heirs , who mingled slander with their persecutions . In spite of the ravages of conflicting passions , her face retained some traces of its former fairness and fineness of tissue , some vestiges of the physical charms of her youth still survived . M. Poiret was a sort of automaton . He might be seen any day sailing like a gray shadow along the walks of the Jardin des Plantes , on his head a shabby cap , a cane with an old yellow ivory handle in the tips of his thin fingers ; the outspread skirts of his threadbare overcoat failed to conceal his meagre figure ; his breeches hung loosely on his shrunken limbs ; the thin , blue-stockinged legs trembled like those of a drunken man ; there was a notable breach of continuity between the dingy white waistcoat and crumpled shirt frills and the cravat twisted about a throat like a turkey gobbler 's ; altogether , his appearance set people wondering whether this outlandish ghost belonged to the audacious race of the sons of Japhet who flutter about on the Boulevard Italien . What devouring kind of toil could have so shriveled him ? What devouring passions had darkened that bulbous countenance , which would have seemed outrageous as a caricature ? What had he been ? Well , perhaps he had been part of the machinery of justice , a clerk in the office to which the executioner sends in his accounts , -- so much for providing black veils for parricides , so much for sawdust , so much for pulleys and cord for the knife . Or he might have been a receiver at the door of a public slaughter-house , or a sub-inspector of nuisances . Indeed , the man appeared to have been one of the beasts of burden in our great social mill ; one of those Parisian Ratons whom their Bertrands do not even know by sight ; a pivot in the obscure machinery that disposes of misery and things unclean ; one of those men , in short , at sight of whom we are prompted to remark that , "" After all , we can not do without them . "" Stately Paris ignores the existence of these faces bleached by moral or physical suffering ; but , then , Paris is in truth an ocean that no line can plumb . You may survey its surface and describe it ; but no matter how numerous and painstaking the toilers in this sea , there will always be lonely and unexplored regions in its depths , caverns unknown , flowers and pearls and monsters of the deep overlooked or forgotten by the divers of literature . The Maison Vauquer is one of these curious monstrosities . Two , however , of Mme . Vauquer's boarders formed a striking contrast to the rest . There was a sickly pallor , such as is often seen in anaemic girls , in Mlle . Victorine Taillefer's face ; and her unvarying expression of sadness , like her embarrassed manner and pinched look , was in keeping with the general wretchedness of the establishment in the Rue Nueve-Saint-Genevieve , which forms a background to this picture ; but her face was young , there was youthfulness in her voice and elasticity in her movements . This young misfortune was not unlike a shrub , newly planted in an uncongenial soil , where its leaves have already begun to wither . The outlines of her figure , revealed by her dress of the simplest and cheapest materials , were also youthful . There was the same kind of charm about her too slender form , her faintly colored face and light-brown hair , that modern poets find in mediaeval statuettes ; and a sweet expression , a look of Christian resignation in the dark gray eyes . She was pretty by force of contrast ; if she had been happy , she would have been charming . Happiness is the poetry of woman , as the toilette is her tinsel . If the delightful excitement of a ball had made the pale face glow with color ; if the delights of a luxurious life had brought the color to the wan cheeks that were slightly hollowed already ; if love had put light into the sad eyes , then Victorine might have ranked among the fairest ; but she lacked the two things which create woman a second time--pretty dresses and love-letters . A book might have been made of her story . Her father was persuaded that he had sufficient reason for declining to acknowledge her , and allowed her a bare six hundred francs a year ; he had further taken measures to disinherit his daughter , and had converted all his real estate into personalty , that he might leave it undivided to his son . Victorine's mother had died broken-hearted in Mme . Couture's house ; and the latter , who was a near relation , had taken charge of the little orphan . Unluckily , the widow of the commissary-general to the armies of the Republic had nothing in the world but her jointure and her widow's pension , and some day she might be obliged to leave the helpless , inexperienced girl to the mercy of the world . The good soul , therefore , took Victorine to mass every Sunday , and to confession once a fortnight , thinking that , in any case , she would bring up her ward to be devout . She was right ; religion offered a solution of the problem of the young girl's future . The poor child loved the father who refused to acknowledge her . Once every year she tried to see him to deliver her mother's message of forgiveness , but every year hitherto she had knocked at that door in vain ; her father was inexorable . Her brother , her only means of communication , had not come to see her for four years , and had sent her no assistance ; yet she prayed to God to unseal her father's eyes and to soften her brother's heart , and no accusations mingled with her prayers . Mme . Couture and Mme . Vauquer exhausted the vocabulary of abuse , and failed to find words that did justice to the banker's iniquitous conduct ; but while they heaped execrations on the millionaire , Victorine's words were as gentle as the moan of the wounded dove , and affection found expression even in the cry drawn from her by pain . Eugene de Rastignac was a thoroughly southern type ; he had a fair complexion , blue eyes , black hair . In his figure , manner , and his whole bearing it was easy to see that he had either come of a noble family , or that , from his earliest childhood , he had been gently bred . If he was careful of his wardrobe , only taking last year's clothes into daily wear , still upon occasion he could issue forth as a young man of fashion . Ordinarily he wore a shabby coat and waistcoat , the limp black cravat , untidily knotted , that students affect , trousers that matched the rest of his costume , and boots that had been resoled . Vautrin ( the man of forty with the dyed whiskers ) marked a transition stage between these two young people and the others . He was the kind of man that calls forth the remark : "" He looks a jovial sort ! "" He had broad shoulders , a well-developed chest , muscular arms , and strong square-fisted hands ; the joints of his fingers were covered with tufts of fiery red hair . His face was furrowed by premature wrinkles ; there was a certain hardness about it in spite of his bland and insinuating manner . His bass voice was by no means unpleasant , and was in keeping with his boisterous laughter . He was always obliging , always in good spirits ; if anything went wrong with one of the locks , he would soon unscrew it , take it to pieces , file it , oil and clean and set it in order , and put it back in its place again ; "" I am an old hand at it , "" he used to say . Not only so , he knew all about ships , the sea , France , foreign countries , men , business , law , great houses and prisons , -- there was nothing that he did not know . If any one complained rather more than usual , he would offer his services at once . He had several times lent money to Mme . Vauquer , or to the boarders ; but , somehow , those whom he obliged felt that they would sooner face death than fail to repay him ; a certain resolute look , sometimes seen on his face , inspired fear of him , for all his appearance of easy good-nature . In the way he spat there was an imperturbable coolness which seemed to indicate that this was a man who would not stick at a crime to extricate himself from a false position . His eyes , like those of a pitiless judge , seemed to go to the very bottom of all questions , to read all natures , all feelings and thoughts . His habit of life was very regular ; he usually went out after breakfast , returning in time for dinner , and disappeared for the rest of the evening , letting himself in about midnight with a latch key , a privilege that Mme . Vauquer accorded to no other boarder . But then he was on very good terms with the widow ; he used to call her "" mamma , "" and put his arm round her waist , a piece of flattery perhaps not appreciated to the full ! The worthy woman might imagine this to be an easy feat ; but , as a matter of fact , no arm but Vautrin's was long enough to encircle her . It was a characteristic trait of his generously to pay fifteen francs a month for the cup of coffee with a dash of brandy in it , which he took after dinner . Less superficial observers than young men engulfed by the whirlpool of Parisian life , or old men , who took no interest in anything that did not directly concern them , would not have stopped short at the vaguely unsatisfactory impression that Vautrin made upon them . He knew or guessed the concerns of every one about him ; but none of them had been able to penetrate his thoughts , or to discover his occupation . He had deliberately made his apparent good-nature , his unfailing readiness to oblige , and his high spirits into a barrier between himself and the rest of them , but not seldom he gave glimpses of appalling depths of character . He seemed to delight in scourging the upper classes of society with the lash of his tongue , to take pleasure in convicting it of inconsistency , in mocking at law and order with some grim jest worthy of Juvenal , as if some grudge against the social system rankled in him , as if there were some mystery carefully hidden away in his life . Mlle . Taillefer felt attracted , perhaps unconsciously , by the strength of the one man , and the good looks of the other ; her stolen glances and secret thoughts were divided between them ; but neither of them seemed to take any notice of her , although some day a chance might alter her position , and she would be a wealthy heiress . For that matter , there was not a soul in the house who took any trouble to investigate the various chronicles of misfortunes , real or imaginary , related by the rest . Each one regarded the others with indifference , tempered by suspicion ; it was a natural result of their relative positions . Practical assistance not one could give , this they all knew , and they had long since exhausted their stock of condolence over previous discussions of their grievances . They were in something the same position as an elderly couple who have nothing left to say to each other . The routine of existence kept them in contact , but they were parts of a mechanism which wanted oil . There was not one of them but would have passed a blind man begging in the street , not one that felt moved to pity by a tale of misfortune , not one who did not see in death the solution of the all-absorbing problem of misery which left them cold to the most terrible anguish in others . The happiest of these hapless beings was certainly Mme . Vauquer , who reigned supreme over this hospital supported by voluntary contributions . For her , the little garden , which silence , and cold , and rain , and drought combined to make as dreary as an Asian _steppe_ , was a pleasant shaded nook ; the gaunt yellow house , the musty odors of a back shop had charms for her , and for her alone . Those cells belonged to her . She fed those convicts condemned to penal servitude for life , and her authority was recognized among them . Where else in Paris would they have found wholesome food in sufficient quantity at the prices she charged them , and rooms which they were at liberty to make , if not exactly elegant or comfortable , at any rate clean and healthy ? If she had committed some flagrant act of injustice , the victim would have borne it in silence . Such a gathering contained , as might have been expected , the elements out of which a complete society might be constructed . And , as in a school , as in the world itself , there was among the eighteen men and women who met round the dinner table a poor creature , despised by all the others , condemned to be the butt of all their jokes . At the beginning of Eugene de Rastignac's second twelvemonth , this figure suddenly started out into bold relief against the background of human forms and faces among which the law student was yet to live for another two years to come . This laughing-stock was the retired vermicelli-merchant , Father Goriot , upon whose face a painter , like the historian , would have concentrated all the light in his picture . How had it come about that the boarders regarded him with a half-malignant contempt ? Why did they subject the oldest among their number to a kind of persecution , in which there was mingled some pity , but no respect for his misfortunes ? Had he brought it on himself by some eccentricity or absurdity , which is less easily forgiven or forgotten than more serious defects ? The question strikes at the root of many a social injustice . Perhaps it is only human nature to inflict suffering on anything that will endure suffering , whether by reason of its genuine humility , or indifference , or sheer helplessness . Do we not , one and all , like to feel our strength even at the expense of some one or of something ? The poorest sample of humanity , the street arab , will pull the bell handle at every street door in bitter weather , and scramble up to write his name on the unsullied marble of a monument . In the year 1813 , at the age of sixty-nine or thereabouts , "" Father Goriot "" had sold his business and retired--to Mme . Vauquer's boarding house . When he first came there he had taken the rooms now occupied by Mme . Couture ; he had paid twelve hundred francs a year like a man to whom five louis more or less was a mere trifle . For him Mme . Vauquer had made various improvements in the three rooms destined for his use , in consideration of a certain sum paid in advance , so it was said , for the miserable furniture , that is to say , for some yellow cotton curtains , a few chairs of stained wood covered with Utrecht velvet , several wretched colored prints in frames , and wall papers that a little suburban tavern would have disdained . Possibly it was the careless generosity with which Father Goriot allowed himself to be overreached at this period of his life ( they called him Monsieur Goriot very respectfully then ) that gave Mme . Vauquer the meanest opinion of his business abilities ; she looked on him as an imbecile where money was concerned . Goriot had brought with him a considerable wardrobe , the gorgeous outfit of a retired tradesman who denies himself nothing . Mme . Vauquer's astonished eyes beheld no less than eighteen cambric-fronted shirts , the splendor of their fineness being enhanced by a pair of pins each bearing a large diamond , and connected by a short chain , an ornament which adorned the vermicelli-maker's shirt front . He usually wore a coat of corn-flower blue ; his rotund and portly person was still further set off by a clean white waistcoat , and a gold chain and seals which dangled over that broad expanse . When his hostess accused him of being "" a bit of a beau , "" he smiled with the vanity of a citizen whose foible is gratified . His cupboards ( _ormoires_ , as he called them in the popular dialect ) were filled with a quantity of plate that he brought with him . The widow's eyes gleamed as she obligingly helped him to unpack the soup ladles , table-spoons , forks , cruet-stands , tureens , dishes , and breakfast services--all of silver , which were duly arranged upon shelves , besides a few more or less handsome pieces of plate , all weighing no inconsiderable number of ounces ; he could not bring himself to part with these gifts that reminded him of past domestic festivals . "" This was my wife 's present to me on the first anniversary of our wedding day , "" he said to Mme . Vauquer , as he put away a little silver posset dish , with two turtle-doves billing on the cover . "" Poor dear ! she spent on it all the money she had saved before we were married . Do you know , I would sooner scratch the earth with my nails for a living , madame , than part with that . But I shall be able to take my coffee out of it every morning for the rest of my days , thank the Lord ! I am not to be pitied . There 's not much fear of my starving for some time to come . "" Finally , Mme . Vauquer's magpie's eye had discovered and read certain entries in the list of shareholders in the funds , and , after a rough calculation , was disposed to credit Goriot ( worthy man ) with something like ten thousand francs a year . From that day forward Mme . Vauquer ( _nee_ de Conflans ) , who , as a matter of fact , had seen forty-eight summers , though she would only own to thirty-nine of them--Mme . Vauquer had her own ideas . Though Goriot's eyes seemed to have shrunk in their sockets , though they were weak and watery , owing to some glandular affection which compelled him to wipe them continually , she considered him to be a very gentlemanly and pleasant-looking man . Moreover , the widow saw favorable indications of character in the well-developed calves of his legs and in his square-shaped nose , indications still further borne out by the worthy man's full-moon countenance and look of stupid good-nature . This , in all probability , was a strongly-build animal , whose brains mostly consisted in a capacity for affection . His hair , worn in _ailes de pigeon_ , and duly powdered every morning by the barber from the Ecole Polytechnique , described five points on his low forehead , and made an elegant setting to his face . Though his manners were somewhat boorish , he was always as neat as a new pin and he took his snuff in a lordly way , like a man who knows that his snuff-box is always likely to be filled with maccaboy , so that when Mme . Vauquer lay down to rest on the day of M. Goriot's installation , her heart , like a larded partridge , sweltered before the fire of a burning desire to shake off the shroud of Vauquer and rise again as Goriot . She would marry again , sell her boarding-house , give her hand to this fine flower of citizenship , become a lady of consequence in the quarter , and ask for subscriptions for charitable purposes ; she would make little Sunday excursions to Choisy , Soissy , Gentilly ; she would have a box at the theatre when she liked , instead of waiting for the author's tickets that one of her boarders sometimes gave her , in July ; the whole Eldorado of a little Parisian household rose up before Mme . Vauquer in her dreams . Nobody knew that she herself possessed forty thousand francs , accumulated _sou by sou_ , that was her secret ; surely as far as money was concerned she was a very tolerable match . "" And in other respects , I am quite his equal , "" she said to herself , turning as if to assure herself of the charms of a form that the portly Sylvie found moulded in down feathers every morning . For three months from that day Mme . Veuve Vauquer availed herself of the services of M. Goriot's coiffeur , and went to some expense over her toilette , expense justifiable on the ground that she owed it to herself and her establishment to pay some attention to appearances when such highly-respectable persons honored her house with their presence . She expended no small amount of ingenuity in a sort of weeding process of her lodgers , announcing her intention of receiving henceforward none but people who were in every way select . If a stranger presented himself , she let him know that M. Goriot , one of the best known and most highly-respected merchants in Paris , had singled out her boarding-house for a residence . She drew up a prospectus headed MAISON VAUQUER , in which it was asserted that hers was "" _one of the oldest and most highly recommended boarding-houses in the Latin Quarter_ . "" "" From the windows of the house , "" thus ran the prospectus , "" there is a charming view of the Vallee des Gobelins ( so there is--from the third floor ) , and a _beautiful_ garden , _extending_ down to _an avenue of lindens_ at the further end . "" Mention was made of the bracing air of the place and its quiet situation . It was this prospectus that attracted Mme . la Comtesse de l ' Ambermesnil , a widow of six and thirty , who was awaiting the final settlement of her husband's affairs , and of another matter regarding a pension due to her as the wife of a general who had died "" on the field of battle . "" On this Mme . Vauquer saw to her table , lighted a fire daily in the sitting-room for nearly six months , and kept the promise of her prospectus , even going to some expense to do so . And the Countess , on her side , addressed Mme . Vauquer as "" my dear , "" and promised her two more boarders , the Baronne de Vaumerland and the widow of a colonel , the late Comte de Picquoisie , who were about to leave a boarding-house in the Marais , where the terms were higher than at the Maison Vauquer . Both these ladies , moreover , would be very well to do when the people at the War Office had come to an end of their formalities . "" But Government departments are always so dilatory , "" the lady added . After dinner the two widows went together up to Mme . Vauquer's room , and had a snug little chat over some cordial and various delicacies reserved for the mistress of the house . Mme . Vauquer's ideas as to Goriot were cordially approved by Mme . de l ' Ambermesnil ; it was a capital notion , which for that matter she had guessed from the very first ; in her opinion the vermicelli maker was an excellent man . "" Ah ! my dear lady , such a well-preserved man of his age , as sound as my eyesight--a man who might make a woman happy ! "" said the widow . The good-natured Countess turned to the subject of Mme . Vauquer's dress , which was not in harmony with her projects . "" You must put yourself on a war footing , "" said she . After much serious consideration the two widows went shopping together--they purchased a hat adorned with ostrich feathers and a cap at the Palais Royal , and the Countess took her friend to the Magasin de la Petite Jeannette , where they chose a dress and a scarf . Thus equipped for the campaign , the widow looked exactly like the prize animal hung out for a sign above an a la mode beef shop ; but she herself was so much pleased with the improvement , as she considered it , in her appearance , that she felt that she lay under some obligation to the Countess ; and , though by no means open-handed , she begged that lady to accept a hat that cost twenty francs . The fact was that she needed the Countess' services on the delicate mission of sounding Goriot ; the countess must sing her praises in his ears . Mme . de l ' Ambermesnil lent herself very good-naturedly to this manoeuvre , began her operations , and succeeded in obtaining a private interview ; but the overtures that she made , with a view to securing him for herself , were received with embarrassment , not to say a repulse . She left him , revolted by his coarseness . "" My angel , "" said she to her dear friend , "" you will make nothing of that man yonder . He is absurdly suspicious , and he is a mean curmudgeon , an idiot , a fool ; you would never be happy with him . "" After what had passed between M. Goriot and Mme . de l ' Ambermesnil , the Countess would no longer live under the same roof . She left the next day , forgot to pay for six months' board , and left behind her wardrobe , cast-off clothing to the value of five francs . Eagerly and persistently as Mme . Vauquer sought her quondam lodger , the Comtesse de l ' Ambermesnil was never heard of again in Paris . The widow often talked of this deplorable business , and regretted her own too confiding disposition . As a matter of fact , she was as suspicious as a cat ; but she was like many other people , who can not trust their own kin and put themselves at the mercy of the next chance comer--an odd but common phenomenon , whose causes may readily be traced to the depths of the human heart . Perhaps there are people who know that they have nothing more to look for from those with whom they live ; they have shown the emptiness of their hearts to their housemates , and in their secret selves they are conscious that they are severely judged , and that they deserve to be judged severely ; but still they feel an unconquerable craving for praises that they do not hear , or they are consumed by a desire to appear to possess , in the eyes of a new audience , the qualities which they have not , hoping to win the admiration or affection of strangers at the risk of forfeiting it again some day . Or , once more , there are other mercenary natures who never do a kindness to a friend or a relation simply because these have a claim upon them , while a service done to a stranger brings its reward to self-love . Such natures feel but little affection for those who are nearest to them ; they keep their kindness for remoter circles of acquaintance , and show most to those who dwell on its utmost limits . Mme . Vauquer belonged to both these essentially mean , false , and execrable classes . "" If I had been there at the time , "" Vautrin would say at the end of the story , "" I would have shown her up , and that misfortune would not have befallen you . I know that kind of phiz ! "" Like all narrow natures , Mme . Vauquer was wont to confine her attention to events , and did not go very deeply into the causes that brought them about ; she likewise preferred to throw the blame of her own mistakes on other people , so she chose to consider that the honest vermicelli maker was responsible for her misfortune . It had opened her eyes , so she said , with regard to him . As soon as she saw that her blandishments were in vain , and that her outlay on her toilette was money thrown away , she was not slow to discover the reason of his indifference . It became plain to her at once that there was _some other attraction_ , to use her own expression . In short , it was evident that the hope she had so fondly cherished was a baseless delusion , and that she would "" never make anything out of that man yonder , "" in the Countess' forcible phrase . The Countess seemed to have been a judge of character . Mme . Vauquer's aversion was naturally more energetic than her friendship , for her hatred was not in proportion to her love , but to her disappointed expectations . The human heart may find here and there a resting-place short of the highest height of affection , but we seldom stop in the steep , downward slope of hatred . Still , M. Goriot was a lodger , and the widow's wounded self-love could not vent itself in an explosion of wrath ; like a monk harassed by the prior of his convent , she was forced to stifle her sighs of disappointment , and to gulp down her craving for revenge . Little minds find gratification for their feelings , benevolent or otherwise , by a constant exercise of petty ingenuity . The widow employed her woman's malice to devise a system of covert persecution . She began by a course of retrenchment--various luxuries which had found their way to the table appeared there no more . "" No more gherkins , no more anchovies ; they have made a fool of me ! "" she said to Sylvie one morning , and they returned to the old bill of fare . The thrifty frugality necessary to those who mean to make their way in the world had become an inveterate habit of life with M. Goriot . Soup , boiled beef , and a dish of vegetables had been , and always would be , the dinner he liked best , so Mme . Vauquer found it very difficult to annoy a boarder whose tastes were so simple . He was proof against her malice , and in desperation she spoke to him and of him slightingly before the other lodgers , who began to amuse themselves at his expense , and so gratified her desire for revenge . Towards the end of the first year the widow's suspicions had reached such a pitch that she began to wonder how it was that a retired merchant with a secure income of seven or eight thousand livres , the owner of such magnificent plate and jewelry handsome enough for a kept mistress , should be living in her house . Why should he devote so small a proportion of his money to his expenses ? Until the first year was nearly at an end , Goriot had dined out once or twice every week , but these occasions came less frequently , and at last he was scarcely absent from the dinner-table twice a month . It was hardly expected that Mme . Vauquer should regard the increased regularity of her boarder's habits with complacency , when those little excursions of his had been so much to her interest . She attributed the change not so much to a gradual diminution of fortune as to a spiteful wish to annoy his hostess . It is one of the most detestable habits of a Liliputian mind to credit other people with its own malignant pettiness . Unluckily , towards the end of the second year , M. Goriot's conduct gave some color to the idle talk about him . He asked Mme . Vauquer to give him a room on the second floor , and to make a corresponding reduction in her charges . Apparently , such strict economy was called for , that he did without a fire all through the winter . Mme . Vauquer asked to be paid in advance , an arrangement to which M. Goriot consented , and thenceforward she spoke of him as "" Father Goriot . "" What had brought about this decline and fall ? Conjecture was keen , but investigation was difficult . Father Goriot was not communicative ; in the sham countess' phrase he was "" a curmudgeon . "" Empty-headed people who babble about their own affairs because they have nothing else to occupy them , naturally conclude that if people say nothing of their doings it is because their doings will not bear being talked about ; so the highly respectable merchant became a scoundrel , and the late beau was an old rogue . Opinion fluctuated . Sometimes , according to Vautrin , who came about this time to live in the Maison Vauquer , Father Goriot was a man who went on ' Change and _dabbled_ ( to use the sufficiently expressive language of the Stock Exchange ) in stocks and shares after he had ruined himself by heavy speculation . Sometimes it was held that he was one of those petty gamblers who nightly play for small stakes until they win a few francs . A theory that he was a detective in the employ of the Home Office found favor at one time , but Vautrin urged that "" Goriot was not sharp enough for one of that sort . "" There were yet other solutions ; Father Goriot was a skinflint , a shark of a money-lender , a man who lived by selling lottery tickets . He was by turns all the most mysterious brood of vice and shame and misery ; yet , however vile his life might be , the feeling of repulsion which he aroused in others was not so strong that he must be banished from their society--he paid his way . Besides , Goriot had his uses , every one vented his spleen or sharpened his wit on him ; he was pelted with jokes and belabored with hard words . The general consensus of opinion was in favor of a theory which seemed the most likely ; this was Mme . Vauquer's view . According to her , the man so well preserved at his time of life , as sound as her eyesight , with whom a woman might be very happy , was a libertine who had strange tastes . These are the facts upon which Mme . Vauquer's slanders were based . Early one morning , some few months after the departure of the unlucky Countess who had managed to live for six months at the widow's expense , Mme . Vauquer ( not yet dressed ) heard the rustle of a silk dress and a young woman's light footstep on the stair ; some one was going to Goriot's room . He seemed to expect the visit , for his door stood ajar . The portly Sylvie presently came up to tell her mistress that a girl too pretty to be honest , "" dressed like a goddess , "" and not a speck of mud on her laced cashmere boots , had glided in from the street like a snake , had found the kitchen , and asked for M. Goriot's room . Mme . Vauquer and the cook , listening , overheard several words affectionately spoken during the visit , which lasted for some time . When M. Goriot went downstairs with the lady , the stout Sylvie forthwith took her basket and followed the lover-like couple , under pretext of going to do her marketing . "" M. Goriot must be awfully rich , all the same , madame , "" she reported on her return , "" to keep her in such style . Just imagine it ! There was a splendid carriage waiting at the corner of the Place de l ' Estrapade , and _she_ got into it . "" While they were at dinner that evening , Mme . Vauquer went to the window and drew the curtain , as the sun was shining into Goriot's eyes . "" You are beloved of fair ladies , M. Goriot--the sun seeks you out , "" she said , alluding to his visitor . "" _Peste ! _ you have good taste ; she was very pretty . "" "" That was my daughter , "" he said , with a kind of pride in his voice , and the rest chose to consider this as the fatuity of an old man who wishes to save appearances . A month after this visit M. Goriot received another . The same daughter who had come to see him that morning came again after dinner , this time in evening dress . The boarders , in deep discussion in the dining-room , caught a glimpse of a lovely , fair-haired woman , slender , graceful , and much too distinguished-looking to be a daughter of Father Goriot's . "" Two of them ! "" cried the portly Sylvie , who did not recognize the lady of the first visit . A few days later , and another young lady--a tall , well-moulded brunette , with dark hair and bright eyes--came to ask for M. Goriot . "" Three of them ! "" said Sylvie . Then the second daughter , who had first come in the morning to see her father , came shortly afterwards in the evening . She wore a ball dress , and came in a carriage . "" Four of them ! "" commented Mme . Vauquer and her plump handmaid . Sylvie saw not a trace of resemblance between this great lady and the girl in her simple morning dress who had entered her kitchen on the occasion of her first visit . At that time Goriot was paying twelve hundred francs a year to his landlady , and Mme . Vauquer saw nothing out of the common in the fact that a rich man had four or five mistresses ; nay , she thought it very knowing of him to pass them off as his daughters . She was not at all inclined to draw a hard-and-fast line , or to take umbrage at his sending for them to the Maison Vauquer ; yet , inasmuch as these visits explained her boarder's indifference to her , she went so far ( at the end of the second year ) as to speak of him as an "" ugly old wretch . "" When at length her boarder declined to nine hundred francs a year , she asked him very insolently what he took her house to be , after meeting one of these ladies on the stairs . Father Goriot answered that the lady was his eldest daughter . "" So you have two or three dozen daughters , have you ? "" said Mme . Vauquer sharply . "" I have only two , "" her boarder answered meekly , like a ruined man who is broken in to all the cruel usage of misfortune . Towards the end of the third year Father Goriot reduced his expenses still further ; he went up to the third story , and now paid forty-five francs a month . He did without snuff , told his hairdresser that he no longer required his services , and gave up wearing powder . When Goriot appeared for the first time in this condition , an exclamation of astonishment broke from his hostess at the color of his hair--a dingy olive gray . He had grown sadder day by day under the influence of some hidden trouble ; among all the faces round the table , his was the most woe-begone . There was no longer any doubt . Goriot was an elderly libertine , whose eyes had only been preserved by the skill of the physician from the malign influence of the remedies necessitated by the state of his health . The disgusting color of his hair was a result of his excesses and of the drugs which he had taken that he might continue his career . The poor old man's mental and physical condition afforded some grounds for the absurd rubbish talked about him . When his outfit was worn out , he replaced the fine linen by calico at fourteen _sous_ the ell . His diamonds , his gold snuff-box , watch-chain and trinkets , disappeared one by one . He had left off wearing the corn-flower blue coat , and was sumptuously arrayed , summer as well as winter , in a coarse chestnut-brown coat , a plush waistcoat , and doeskin breeches . He grew thinner and thinner ; his legs were shrunken , his cheeks , once so puffed out by contented bourgeois prosperity , were covered with wrinkles , and the outlines of the jawbones were distinctly visible ; there were deep furrows in his forehead . In the fourth year of his residence in the Rue Neuve-Sainte-Genevieve he was no longer like his former self . The hale vermicelli manufacturer , sixty-two years of age , who had looked scarce forty , the stout , comfortable , prosperous tradesman , with an almost bucolic air , and such a brisk demeanor that it did you good to look at him ; the man with something boyish in his smile , had suddenly sunk into his dotage , and had become a feeble , vacillating septuagenarian . The keen , bright blue eyes had grown dull , and faded to a steel-gray color ; the red inflamed rims looked as though they had shed tears of blood . He excited feelings of repulsion in some , and of pity in others . The young medical students who came to the house noticed the drooping of his lower lip and the conformation of the facial angle ; and , after teasing him for some time to no purpose , they declared that cretinism was setting in . One evening after dinner Mme . Vauquer said half banteringly to him , "" So those daughters of yours do n't come to see you any more , eh ? "" meaning to imply her doubts as to his paternity ; but Father Goriot shrank as if his hostess had touched him with a sword-point . "" They come sometimes , "" he said in a tremulous voice . "" Aha ! you still see them sometimes ? "" cried the students . "" Bravo , Father Goriot ! "" The old man scarcely seemed to hear the witticisms at his expense that followed on the words ; he had relapsed into the dreamy state of mind that these superficial observers took for senile torpor , due to his lack of intelligence . If they had only known , they might have been deeply interested by the problem of his condition ; but few problems were more obscure . It was easy , of course , to find out whether Goriot had really been a vermicelli manufacturer ; the amount of his fortune was readily discoverable ; but the old people , who were most inquisitive as to his concerns , never went beyond the limits of the Quarter , and lived in the lodging-house much as oysters cling to a rock . As for the rest , the current of life in Paris daily awaited them , and swept them away with it ; so soon as they left the Rue Neuve-Sainte-Genevieve , they forgot the existence of the old man , their butt at dinner . For those narrow souls , or for careless youth , the misery in Father Goriot's withered face and its dull apathy were quite incompatible with wealth or any sort of intelligence . As for the creatures whom he called his daughters , all Mme . Vauquer's boarders were of her opinion . With the faculty for severe logic sedulously cultivated by elderly women during long evenings of gossip till they can always find an hypothesis to fit all circumstances , she was wont to reason thus : "" If Father Goriot had daughters of his own as rich as those ladies who came here seemed to be , he would not be lodging in my house , on the third floor , at forty-five francs a month ; and he would not go about dressed like a poor man . "" No objection could be raised to these inferences . So by the end of the month of November 1819 , at the time when the curtain rises on this drama , every one in the house had come to have a very decided opinion as to the poor old man . He had never had either wife or daughter ; excesses had reduced him to this sluggish condition ; he was a sort of human mollusk who should be classed among the capulidoe , so one of the dinner contingent , an _employe_ at the Museum , who had a pretty wit of his own . Poiret was an eagle , a gentleman , compared with Goriot . Poiret would join the talk , argue , answer when he was spoken to ; as a matter of fact , his talk , arguments , and responses contributed nothing to the conversation , for Poiret had a habit of repeating what the others said in different words ; still , he did join in the talk ; he was alive , and seemed capable of feeling ; while Father Goriot ( to quote the Museum official again ) was invariably at zero degrees--Reaumur . Eugene de Rastignac had just returned to Paris in a state of mind not unknown to young men who are conscious of unusual powers , and to those whose faculties are so stimulated by a difficult position , that for the time being they rise above the ordinary level . Rastignac's first year of study for the preliminary examinations in law had left him free to see the sights of Paris and to enjoy some of its amusements . A student has not much time on his hands if he sets himself to learn the repertory of every theatre , and to study the ins and outs of the labyrinth of Paris . To know its customs ; to learn the language , and become familiar with the amusements of the capital , he must explore its recesses , good and bad , follow the studies that please him best , and form some idea of the treasures contained in galleries and museums . At this stage of his career a student grows eager and excited about all sorts of follies that seem to him to be of immense importance . He has his hero , his great man , a professor at the College de France , paid to talk down to the level of his audience . He adjusts his cravat , and strikes various attitudes for the benefit of the women in the first galleries at the Opera-Comique . As he passes through all these successive initiations , and breaks out of his sheath , the horizons of life widen around him , and at length he grasps the plan of society with the different human strata of which it is composed . If he begins by admiring the procession of carriages on sunny afternoons in the Champs-Elysees , he soon reaches the further stage of envying their owners . Unconsciously , Eugene had served his apprenticeship before he went back to Angouleme for the long vacation after taking his degrees as bachelor of arts and bachelor of law . The illusions of childhood had vanished , so also had the ideas he brought with him from the provinces ; he had returned thither with an intelligence developed , with loftier ambitions , and saw things as they were at home in the old manor house . His father and mother , his two brothers and two sisters , with an aged aunt , whose whole fortune consisted in annuities , lived on the little estate of Rastignac . The whole property brought in about three thousand francs ; and though the amount varied with the season ( as must always be the case in a vine-growing district ) , they were obliged to spare an unvarying twelve hundred francs out of their income for him . He saw how constantly the poverty , which they had generously hidden from him , weighed upon them ; he could not help comparing the sisters , who had seemed so beautiful to his boyish eyes , with women in Paris , who had realized the beauty of his dreams . The uncertain future of the whole family depended upon him . It did not escape his eyes that not a crumb was wasted in the house , nor that the wine they drank was made from the second pressing ; a multitude of small things , which it is useless to speak of in detail here , made him burn to distinguish himself , and his ambition to succeed increased tenfold . He meant , like all great souls , that his success should be owing entirely to his merits ; but his was pre-eminently a southern temperament , the execution of his plans was sure to be marred by the vertigo that seizes on youth when youth sees itself alone in a wide sea , uncertain how to spend its energies , whither to steer its course , how to adapt its sails to the winds . At first he determined to fling himself heart and soul into his work , but he was diverted from this purpose by the need of society and connections ; then he saw how great an influence women exert in social life , and suddenly made up his mind to go out into this world to seek a protectress there . Surely a clever and high-spirited young man , whose wit and courage were set off to advantage by a graceful figure and the vigorous kind of beauty that readily strikes a woman's imagination , need not despair of finding a protectress . These ideas occurred to him in his country walks with his sisters , whom he had once joined so gaily . The girls thought him very much changed . His aunt , Mme . de Marcillac , had been presented at court , and had moved among the brightest heights of that lofty region . Suddenly the young man's ambition discerned in those recollections of hers , which had been like nursery fairy tales to her nephews and nieces , the elements of a social success at least as important as the success which he had achieved at the Ecole de Droit . He began to ask his aunt about those relations ; some of the old ties might still hold good . After much shaking of the branches of the family tree , the old lady came to the conclusion that of all persons who could be useful to her nephew among the selfish genus of rich relations , the Vicomtesse de Beauseant was the least likely to refuse . To this lady , therefore , she wrote in the old-fashioned style , recommending Eugene to her ; pointing out to her nephew that if he succeeded in pleasing Mme . de Beauseant , the Vicomtesse would introduce him to other relations . A few days after his return to Paris , therefore , Rastignac sent his aunt's letter to Mme . de Beauseant . The Vicomtesse replied by an invitation to a ball for the following evening . This was the position of affairs at the Maison Vauquer at the end of November 1819 . A few days later , after Mme . de Beauseant's ball , Eugene came in at two o ' clock in the morning . The persevering student meant to make up for the lost time by working until daylight . It was the first time that he had attempted to spend the night in this way in that silent quarter . The spell of a factitious energy was upon him ; he had beheld the pomp and splendor of the world . He had not dined at the Maison Vauquer ; the boarders probably would think that he would walk home at daybreak from the dance , as he had done sometimes on former occasions , after a fete at the Prado , or a ball at the Odeon , splashing his silk stockings thereby , and ruining his pumps . It so happened that Christophe took a look into the street before drawing the bolts of the door ; and Rastignac , coming in at that moment , could go up to his room without making any noise , followed by Christophe , who made a great deal . Eugene exchanged his dress suit for a shabby overcoat and slippers , kindled a fire with some blocks of patent fuel , and prepared for his night's work in such a sort that the faint sounds he made were drowned by Christophe's heavy tramp on the stairs . Eugene sat absorbed in thought for a few moments before plunging into his law books . He had just become aware of the fact that the Vicomtesse de Beauseant was one of the queens of fashion , that her house was thought to be the pleasantest in the Faubourg Saint-Germain . And not only so , she was , by right of her fortune , and the name she bore , one of the most conspicuous figures in that aristocratic world . Thanks to the aunt , thanks to Mme . de Marcillac's letter of introduction , the poor student had been kindly received in that house before he knew the extent of the favor thus shown to him . It was almost like a patent of nobility to be admitted to those gilded salons ; he had appeared in the most exclusive circle in Paris , and now all doors were open for him . Eugene had been dazzled at first by the brilliant assembly , and had scarcely exchanged a few words with the Vicomtesse ; he had been content to single out a goddess among this throng of Parisian divinities , one of those women who are sure to attract a young man's fancy . The Comtesse Anastasie de Restaud was tall and gracefully made ; she had one of the prettiest figures in Paris . Imagine a pair of great dark eyes , a magnificently moulded hand , a shapely foot . There was a fiery energy in her movements ; the Marquis de Ronquerolles had called her "" a thoroughbred , "" "" a pure pedigree , "" these figures of speech have replaced the "" heavenly angel "" and Ossianic nomenclature ; the old mythology of love is extinct , doomed to perish by modern dandyism . But for Rastignac , Mme . Anastasie de Restaud was the woman for whom he had sighed . He had contrived to write his name twice upon the list of partners upon her fan , and had snatched a few words with her during the first quadrille . "" Where shall I meet you again , Madame ? "" he asked abruptly , and the tones of his voice were full of the vehement energy that women like so well . "" Oh , everywhere ! "" said she , "" in the Bois , at the Bouffons , in my own house . "" With the impetuosity of his adventurous southern temper , he did all he could to cultivate an acquaintance with this lovely countess , making the best of his opportunities in the quadrille and during a waltz that she gave him . When he told her that he was a cousin of Mme . de Beauseant's , the Countess , whom he took for a great lady , asked him to call at her house , and after her parting smile , Rastignac felt convinced that he must make this visit . He was so lucky as to light upon some one who did not laugh at his ignorance , a fatal defect among the gilded and insolent youth of that period ; the coterie of Maulincourts , Maximes de Trailles , de Marsays , Ronquerolles , Ajuda-Pintos , and Vandenesses who shone there in all the glory of coxcombry among the best-dressed women of fashion in Paris--Lady Brandon , the Duchesse de Langeais , the Comtesse de Kergarouet , Mme . de Serizy , the Duchesse de Carigliano , the Comtesse Ferraud , Mme . de Lanty , the Marquise d ' Aiglemont , Mme . Firmiani , the Marquise de Listomere and the Marquise d ' Espard , the Duchesse de Maufrigneuse and the Grandlieus . Luckily , therefore , for him , the novice happened upon the Marquis de Montriveau , the lover of the Duchesse de Langeais , a general as simple as a child ; from him Rastignac learned that the Comtesse lived in the Rue du Helder . Ah , what it is to be young , eager to see the world , greedily on the watch for any chance that brings you nearer the woman of your dreams , and behold two houses open their doors to you ! To set foot in the Vicomtesse de Beauseant's house in the Faubourg Saint-Germain ; to fall on your knees before a Comtesse de Restaud in the Chaussee d ' Antin ; to look at one glance across a vista of Paris drawing-rooms , conscious that , possessing sufficient good looks , you may hope to find aid and protection there in a feminine heart ! To feel ambitious enough to spurn the tight-rope on which you must walk with the steady head of an acrobat for whom a fall is impossible , and to find in a charming woman the best of all balancing poles . He sat there with his thoughts for a while , Law on the one hand , and Poverty on the other , beholding a radiant vision of a woman rise above the dull , smouldering fire . Who would not have paused and questioned the future as Eugene was doing ? who would not have pictured it full of success ? His wondering thoughts took wings ; he was transported out of the present into that blissful future ; he was sitting by Mme . de Restaud's side , when a sort of sigh , like the grunt of an overburdened St. Joseph , broke the silence of the night . It vibrated through the student , who took the sound for a death groan . He opened his door noiselessly , went out upon the landing , and saw a thin streak of light under Father Goriot's door . Eugene feared that his neighbor had been taken ill ; he went over and looked through the keyhole ; the old man was busily engaged in an occupation so singular and so suspicious that Rastignac thought he was only doing a piece of necessary service to society to watch the self-styled vermicelli maker's nocturnal industries . The table was upturned , and Goriot had doubtless in some way secured a silver plate and cup to the bar before knotting a thick rope round them ; he was pulling at this rope with such enormous force that they were being crushed and twisted out of shape ; to all appearance he meant to convert the richly wrought metal into ingots . "" _Peste ! _ what a man ! "" said Rastignac , as he watched Goriot's muscular arms ; there was not a sound in the room while the old man , with the aid of the rope , was kneading the silver like dough . "" Was he then , indeed , a thief , or a receiver of stolen goods , who affected imbecility and decrepitude , and lived like a beggar that he might carry on his pursuits the more securely ? "" Eugene stood for a moment revolving these questions , then he looked again through the keyhole . Father Goriot had unwound his coil of rope ; he had covered the table with a blanket , and was now employed in rolling the flattened mass of silver into a bar , an operation which he performed with marvelous dexterity . "" Why , he must be as strong as Augustus , King of Poland ! "" said Eugene to himself when the bar was nearly finished . Father Goriot looked sadly at his handiwork , tears fell from his eyes , he blew out the dip which had served him for a light while he manipulated the silver , and Eugene heard him sigh as he lay down again . "" He is mad , "" thought the student . "" _Poor child ! _ "" Father Goriot said aloud . Rastignac , hearing those words , concluded to keep silence ; he would not hastily condemn his neighbor . He was just in the doorway of his room when a strange sound from the staircase below reached his ears ; it might have been made by two men coming up in list slippers . Eugene listened ; two men there certainly were , he could hear their breathing . Yet there had been no sound of opening the street door , no footsteps in the passage . Suddenly , too , he saw a faint gleam of light on the second story ; it came from M. Vautrin's room . "" There are a good many mysteries here for a lodging-house ! "" he said to himself . He went part of the way downstairs and listened again . The rattle of gold reached his ears . In another moment the light was put out , and again he distinctly heard the breathing of two men , but no sound of a door being opened or shut . The two men went downstairs , the faint sounds growing fainter as they went . "" Who is there ? "" cried Mme . Vauquer out of her bedroom window . "" I , Mme . Vauquer , "" answered Vautrin's deep bass voice . "" I am coming in . "" "" That is odd ! Christophe drew the bolts , "" said Eugene , going back to his room . "" You have to sit up at night , it seems , if you really mean to know all that is going on about you in Paris . "" These incidents turned his thought from his ambitious dreams ; he betook himself to his work , but his thought wandered back to Father Goriot's suspicious occupation ; Mme . de Restaud's face swam again and again before his eyes like a vision of a brilliant future ; and at last he lay down and slept with clenched fists . When a young man makes up his mind that he will work all night , the chances are that seven times out of ten he will sleep till morning . Such vigils do not begin before we are turned twenty . The next morning Paris was wrapped in one of the dense fogs that throw the most punctual people out in their calculations as to the time ; even the most business-like folk fail to keep their appointments in such weather , and ordinary mortals wake up at noon and fancy it is eight o ' clock . On this morning it was half-past nine , and Mme . Vauquer still lay abed . Christophe was late , Sylvie was late , but the two sat comfortably taking their coffee as usual . It was Sylvie's custom to take the cream off the milk destined for the boarders' breakfast for her own , and to boil the remainder for some time , so that madame should not discover this illegal exaction . "" Sylvie , "" said Christophe , as he dipped a piece of toast into the coffee , "" M. Vautrin , who is not such a bad sort , all the same , had two people come to see him again last night . If madame says anything , mind you say nothing about it . "" "" Has he given you something ? "" "" He gave me a five-franc piece this month , which is as good as saying , ' Hold your tongue . ' "" "" Except him and Mme . Couture , who does n ' t look twice at every penny , there 's no one in the house that does n ' t try to get back with the left hand all that they give with the right at New Year , "" said Sylvie . "" And , after all , "" said Christophe , "" what do they give you ? A miserable five-franc piece . There is Father Goriot , who has cleaned his shoes himself these two years past . There is that old beggar Poiret , who goes without blacking altogether ; he would sooner drink it than put it on his boots . Then there is that whipper-snapper of a student , who gives me a couple of francs . Two francs will not pay for my brushes , and he sells his old clothes , and gets more for them than they are worth . Oh ! they 're a shabby lot ! "" "" Pooh ! "" said Sylvie , sipping her coffee , "" our places are the best in the Quarter , that I know . But about that great big chap Vautrin , Christophe ; has any one told you anything about him ? "" "" Yes . I met a gentleman in the street a few days ago ; he said to me , ' There 's a gentleman in your place , is n't there ? a tall man that dyes his whiskers ? ' I told him , ' No , sir ; they are n ' t dyed . A gay fellow like him has n ' t the time to do it . ' And when I told M. Vautrin about it afterwards , he said , ' Quite right , my boy . That is the way to answer them . There is nothing more unpleasant than to have your little weaknesses known ; it might spoil many a match . ' "" "" Well , and for my part , "" said Sylvie , "" a man tried to humbug me at the market wanting to know if I had seen him put on his shirt . Such bosh ! There , "" she cried , interrupting herself , "" that 's a quarter to ten striking at the Val-de-Grace , and not a soul stirring ! "" "" Pooh ! they are all gone out . Mme . Couture and the girl went out at eight o ' clock to take the wafer at Saint-Etienne . Father Goriot started off somewhere with a parcel , and the student wo n ' t be back from his lecture till ten o ' clock . I saw them go while I was sweeping the stairs ; Father Goriot knocked up against me , and his parcel was as hard as iron . What is the old fellow up to , I wonder ? He is as good as a plaything for the rest of them ; they can never let him alone ; but he is a good man , all the same , and worth more than all of them put together . He does n ' t give you much himself , but he sometimes sends you with a message to ladies who fork out famous tips ; they are dressed grandly , too . "" "" His daughters , as he calls them , eh ? There are a dozen of them . "" "" I have never been to more than two--the two who came here . "" "" There is madame moving overhead ; I shall have to go , or she will raise a fine racket . Just keep an eye on the milk , Christophe ; do n't let the cat get at it . "" Sylvie went up to her mistress' room . "" Sylvie ! How is this ? It 's nearly ten o ' clock , and you let me sleep like a dormouse ! Such a thing has never happened before . "" "" It 's the fog ; it is that thick , you could cut it with a knife . "" "" But how about breakfast ? "" "" Bah ! the boarders are possessed , I 'm sure . They all cleared out before there was a wink of daylight . "" "" Do speak properly , Sylvie , "" Mme . Vauquer retorted ; "" say a blink of daylight . "" "" Ah , well , madame , whichever you please . Anyhow , you can have breakfast at ten o ' clock . La Michonnette and Poiret have neither of them stirred . There are only those two upstairs , and they are sleeping like the logs they are . "" "" But , Sylvie , you put their names together as if ---- "" "" As if what ? "" said Sylvie , bursting into a guffaw . "" The two of them make a pair . "" "" It is a strange thing , is n't it , Sylvie , how M. Vautrin got in last night after Christophe had bolted the door ? "" "" Not at all , madame . Christophe heard M. Vautrin , and went down and undid the door . And here are you imagining that ---- ? "" "" Give me my bodice , and be quick and get breakfast ready . Dish up the rest of the mutton with the potatoes , and you can put the stewed pears on the table , those at five a penny . "" A few moments later Mme . Vauquer came down , just in time to see the cat knock down a plate that covered a bowl of milk , and begin to lap in all haste . "" Mistigris ! "" she cried . The cat fled , but promptly returned to rub against her ankles . "" Oh ! yes , you can wheedle , you old hypocrite ! "" she said . "" Sylvie ! Sylvie ! "" "" Yes , madame ; what is it ? "" "" Just see what the cat has done ! "" "" It is all that stupid Christophe's fault . I told him to stop and lay the table . What has become of him ? Do n't you worry , madame ; Father Goriot shall have it . I will fill it up with water , and he wo n ' t know the difference ; he never notices anything , not even what he eats . "" "" I wonder where the old heathen can have gone ? "" said Mme . Vauquer , setting the plates round the table . "" Who knows ? He is up to all sorts of tricks . "" "" I have overslept myself , "" said Mme . Vauquer . "" But madame looks as fresh as a rose , all the same . "" The door bell rang at that moment , and Vautrin came through the sitting-room , singing loudly : "" ' Tis the same old story everywhere , A roving heart and a roving glance .. "" Oh ! Mamma Vauquer ! good-morning ! "" he cried at the sight of his hostess , and he put his arm gaily round her waist . "" There ! have done ---- "" "" ' Impertinence ! ' Say it ! "" he answered . "" Come , say it ! Now , is n't that what you really mean ? Stop a bit , I will help you to set the table . Ah ! I am a nice man , am I not ? "" For the locks of brown and the golden hair A sighing lover ... "" Oh ! I have just seen something so funny ---- .... led by chance . "" "" What ? "" asked the widow . "" Father Goriot in the goldsmith's shop in the Rue Dauphine at half-past eight this morning . They buy old spoons and forks and gold lace there , and Goriot sold a piece of silver plate for a good round sum . It had been twisted out of shape very neatly for a man that 's not used to the trade . "" "" Really ? You do n't say so ? "" "" Yes . One of my friends is expatriating himself ; I had been to see him off on board the Royal Mail steamer , and was coming back here . I waited after that to see what Father Goriot would do ; it is a comical affair . He came back to this quarter of the world , to the Rue des Gres , and went into a money-lender's house ; everybody knows him , Gobseck , a stuck-up rascal , that would make dominoes out of his father's bones , a Turk , a heathen , an old Jew , a Greek ; it would be a difficult matter to rob _him_ , for he puts all his coin into the Bank . "" "" Then what was Father Goriot doing there ? "" "" Doing ? "" said Vautrin . "" Nothing ; he was bent on his own undoing . He is a simpleton , stupid enough to ruin himself by running after ---- "" "" There he is ! "" cried Sylvie . "" Christophe , "" cried Father Goriot's voice , "" come upstairs with me . "" Christophe went up , and shortly afterwards came down again . "" Where are you going ? "" Mme . Vauquer asked of her servant . "" Out on an errand for M. Goriot . "" "" What may that be ? "" said Vautrin , pouncing on a letter in Christophe's hand . "" _Mme . la Comtesse Anastasie de Restaud_ , "" he read . "" Where are you going with it ? "" he added , as he gave the letter back to Christophe . "" To the Rue du Helder . I have orders to give this into her hands myself . "" "" What is there inside it ? "" said Vautrin , holding the letter up to the light . "" A banknote ? No. "" He peered into the envelope . "" A receipted account ! "" he cried . "" My word ! ' tis a gallant old dotard . Off with you , old chap , "" he said , bringing down a hand on Christophe's head , and spinning the man round like a thimble ; "" you will have a famous tip . "" By this time the table was set . Sylvie was boiling the milk , Mme . Vauquer was lighting a fire in the stove with some assistance from Vautrin , who kept humming to himself : "" The same old story everywhere , A roving heart and a roving glance . "" When everything was ready , Mme . Couture and Mlle . Taillefer came in . "" Where have you been this morning , fair lady ? "" said Mme . Vauquer , turning to Mme . Couture . "" We have just been to say our prayers at Saint-Etienne du Mont. To-day is the day when we must go to see M. Taillefer . Poor little thing ! She is trembling like a leaf , "" Mme . Couture went on , as she seated herself before the fire and held the steaming soles of her boots to the blaze . "" Warm yourself , Victorine , "" said Mme . Vauquer . "" It is quite right and proper , mademoiselle , to pray to Heaven to soften your father's heart , "" said Vautrin , as he drew a chair nearer to the orphan girl ; "" but that is not enough . What you want is a friend who will give the monster a piece of his mind ; a barbarian that has three millions ( so they say ) , and will not give you a dowry ; and a pretty girl needs a dowry nowadays . "" "" Poor child ! "" said Mme . Vauquer . "" Never mind , my pet , your wretch of a father is going just the way to bring trouble upon himself . "" Victorine's eyes filled with tears at the words , and the widow checked herself at a sign from Mme . Couture . "" If we could only see him ! "" said the Commissary-General's widow ; "" if I could speak to him myself and give him his wife's last letter ! I have never dared to run the risk of sending it by post ; he knew my handwriting ---- "" "" ' Oh woman , persecuted and injured innocent ! ' "" exclaimed Vautrin , breaking in upon her . "" So that is how you are , is it ? In a few days' time I will look into your affairs , and it will be all right , you shall see . "" "" Oh ! sir , "" said Victorine , with a tearful but eager glance at Vautrin , who showed no sign of being touched by it , "" if you know of any way of communicating with my father , please be sure and tell him that his affection and my mother's honor are more to me than all the money in the world . If you can induce him to relent a little towards me , I will pray to God for you . You may be sure of my gratitude ---- "" "" _The same old story everywhere_ , "" sang Vautrin , with a satirical intonation . At this juncture , Goriot , Mlle . Michonneau , and Poiret came downstairs together ; possibly the scent of the gravy which Sylvie was making to serve with the mutton had announced breakfast . The seven people thus assembled bade each other good-morning , and took their places at the table ; the clock struck ten , and the student's footstep was heard outside . "" Ah ! here you are , M. Eugene , "" said Sylvie ; "" every one is breakfasting at home to-day . "" The student exchanged greetings with the lodgers , and sat down beside Goriot . "" I have just met with a queer adventure , "" he said , as he helped himself abundantly to the mutton , and cut a slice of bread , which Mme . Vauquer's eyes gauged as usual . "" An adventure ? "" queried Poiret . "" Well , and what is there to astonish you in that , old boy ? "" Vautrin asked of Poiret . "" M. Eugene is cut out for that kind of thing . "" Mlle . Taillefer stole a timid glance at the young student . "" Tell us about your adventure ! "" demanded M. Vautrin . "" Yesterday evening I went to a ball given by a cousin of mine , the Vicomtesse de Beauseant . She has a magnificent house ; the rooms are hung with silk--in short , it was a splendid affair , and I was as happy as a king --- "" "" Fisher , "" put in Vautrin , interrupting . "" What do you mean , sir ? "" said Eugene sharply . "" I said ' fisher , ' because kingfishers see a good deal more fun than kings . "" "" Quite true ; I would much rather be the little careless bird than a king , "" said Poiret the ditto-ist , "" because ---- "" "" In fact "" -- the law-student cut him short -- "" I danced with one of the handsomest women in the room , a charming countess , the most exquisite creature I have ever seen . There was peach blossom in her hair , and she had the loveliest bouquet of flowers--real flowers , that scented the air----but there ! it is no use trying to describe a woman glowing with the dance . You ought to have seen her ! Well , and this morning I met this divine countess about nine o ' clock , on foot in the Rue de Gres . Oh ! how my heart beat ! I began to think ---- "" "" That she was coming here , "" said Vautrin , with a keen look at the student . "" I expect that she was going to call on old Gobseck , a money-lender . If ever you explore a Parisian woman's heart , you will find the money-lender first , and the lover afterwards . Your countess is called Anastasie de Restaud , and she lives in the Rue du Helder . "" The student stared hard at Vautrin . Father Goriot raised his head at the words , and gave the two speakers a glance so full of intelligence and uneasiness that the lodgers beheld him with astonishment . "" Then Christophe was too late , and she must have gone to him ! "" cried Goriot , with anguish in his voice . "" It is just as I guessed , "" said Vautrin , leaning over to whisper in Mme . Vauquer's ear . Goriot went on with his breakfast , but seemed unconscious of what he was doing . He had never looked more stupid nor more taken up with his own thoughts than he did at that moment . "" Who the devil could have told you her name , M. Vautrin ? "" asked Eugene . "" Aha ! there you are ! "" answered Vautrin . "" Old Father Goriot there knew it quite well ! and why should I not know it too ? "" "" M. Goriot ? "" the student cried . "" What is it ? "" asked the old man . "" So she was very beautiful , was she , yesterday night ? "" "" Who ? "" "" Mme . de Restaud . "" "" Look at the old wretch , "" said Mme . Vauquer , speaking to Vautrin ; "" how his eyes light up ! "" "" Then does he really keep her ? "" said Mlle . Michonneau , in a whisper to the student . "" Oh ! yes , she was tremendously pretty , "" Eugene answered . Father Goriot watched him with eager eyes . "" If Mme . de Beauseant had not been there , my divine countess would have been the queen of the ball ; none of the younger men had eyes for any one else . I was the twelfth on her list , and she danced every quadrille . The other women were furious . She must have enjoyed herself , if ever creature did ! It is a true saying that there is no more beautiful sight than a frigate in full sail , a galloping horse , or a woman dancing . "" "" So the wheel turns , "" said Vautrin ; "" yesterday night at a duchess' ball , this morning in a money-lender's office , on the lowest rung of the ladder--just like a Parisienne ! If their husbands can not afford to pay for their frantic extravagance , they will sell themselves . Or if they can not do that , they will tear out their mothers' hearts to find something to pay for their splendor . They will turn the world upside down . Just a Parisienne through and through ! "" Father Goriot's face , which had shone at the student's words like the sun on a bright day , clouded over all at once at this cruel speech of Vautrin's . "" Well , "" said Mme . Vauquer , "" but where is your adventure ? Did you speak to her ? Did you ask her if she wanted to study law ? "" "" She did not see me , "" said Eugene . "" But only think of meeting one of the prettiest women in Paris in the Rue des Gres at nine o ' clock ! She could not have reached home after the ball till two o ' clock this morning . Was n ' t it queer ? There is no place like Paris for this sort of adventures . "" "" Pshaw ! much funnier things than _that_ happen here ! "" exclaimed Vautrin . Mlle . Taillefer had scarcely heeded the talk , she was so absorbed by the thought of the new attempt that she was about to make . Mme . Couture made a sign that it was time to go upstairs and dress ; the two ladies went out , and Father Goriot followed their example . "" Well , did you see ? "" said Mme . Vauquer , addressing Vautrin and the rest of the circle . "" He is ruining himself for those women , that is plain . "" "" Nothing will ever make me believe that that beautiful Comtesse de Restaud is anything to Father Goriot , "" cried the student . "" Well , and if you do n't , "" broke in Vautrin , "" we are not set on convincing you . You are too young to know Paris thoroughly yet ; later on you will find out that there are what we call men with a passion ---- "" Mlle . Michonneau gave Vautrin a quick glance at these words . They seemed to be like the sound of a trumpet to a trooper's horse . "" Aha ! "" said Vautrin , stopping in his speech to give her a searching glance , "" so we have had our little experiences , have we ? "" The old maid lowered her eyes like a nun who sees a statue . "" Well , "" he went on , "" when folk of that kind get a notion into their heads , they can not drop it . They must drink the water from some particular spring--it is stagnant as often as not ; but they will sell their wives and families , they will sell their own souls to the devil to get it . For some this spring is play , or the stock-exchange , or music , or a collection of pictures or insects ; for others it is some woman who can give them the dainties they like . You might offer these last all the women on earth--they would turn up their noses ; they will have the only one who can gratify their passion . It often happens that the woman does not care for them at all , and treats them cruelly ; they buy their morsels of satisfaction very dear ; but no matter , the fools are never tired of it ; they will take their last blanket to the pawnbroker 's to give their last five-franc piece to her . Father Goriot here is one of that sort . He is discreet , so the Countess exploits him--just the way of the gay world . The poor old fellow thinks of her and of nothing else . In all other respects you see he is a stupid animal ; but get him on that subject , and his eyes sparkle like diamonds . That secret is not difficult to guess . He took some plate himself this morning to the melting-pot , and I saw him at Daddy Gobseck's in the Rue des Gres . And now , mark what follows--he came back here , and gave a letter for the Comtesse de Restaud to that noodle of a Christophe , who showed us the address ; there was a receipted bill inside it . It is clear that it was an urgent matter if the Countess also went herself to the old money lender . Father Goriot has financed her handsomely . There is no need to tack a tale together ; the thing is self-evident . So that shows you , sir student , that all the time your Countess was smiling , dancing , flirting , swaying her peach-flower crowned head , with her gown gathered into her hand , her slippers were pinching her , as they say ; she was thinking of her protested bills , or her lover's protested bills . "" "" You have made me wild to know the truth , "" cried Eugene ; "" I will go to call on Mme . de Restaud to-morrow . "" "" Yes , "" echoed Poiret ; "" you must go and call on Mme . de Restaud . "" "" And perhaps you will find Father Goriot there , who will take payment for the assistance he politely rendered . "" Eugene looked disgusted . "" Why , then , this Paris of yours is a slough . "" "" And an uncommonly queer slough , too , "" replied Vautrin . "" The mud splashes you as you drive through it in your carriage--you are a respectable person ; you go afoot and are splashed--you are a scoundrel . You are so unlucky as to walk off with something or other belonging to somebody else , and they exhibit you as a curiosity in the Place du Palais-de-Justice ; you steal a million , and you are pointed out in every salon as a model of virtue . And you pay thirty millions for the police and the courts of justice , for the maintenance of law and order ! A pretty slate of things it is ! "" "" What , "" cried Mme . Vauquer , "" has Father Goriot really melted down his silver posset-dish ? "" "" There were two turtle-doves on the lid , were there not ? "" asked Eugene . "" Yes , that there were . "" "" Then , was he fond of it ? "" said Eugene . "" He cried while he was breaking up the cup and plate . I happened to see him by accident . "" "" It was dear to him as his own life , "" answered the widow . "" There ! you see how infatuated the old fellow is ! "" cried Vautrin . "" The woman yonder can coax the soul out of him . "" The student went up to his room . Vautrin went out , and a few moments later Mme . Couture and Victorine drove away in a cab which Sylvie had called for them . Poiret gave his arm to Mlle . Michonneau , and they went together to spend the two sunniest hours of the day in the Jardin des Plantes . "" Well , those two are as good as married , "" was the portly Sylvie's comment . "" They are going out together to-day for the first time . They are such a couple of dry sticks that if they happen to strike against each other they will draw sparks like flint and steel . "" "" Keep clear of Mlle . Michonneau's shawl , then , "" said Mme . Vauquer , laughing ; "" it would flare up like tinder . "" At four o ' clock that evening , when Goriot came in , he saw , by the light of two smoky lamps , that Victorine's eyes were red . Mme . Vauquer was listening to the history of the visit made that morning to M. Taillefer ; it had been made in vain . Taillefer was tired of the annual application made by his daughter and her elderly friend ; he gave them a personal interview in order to arrive at an understanding with them . "" My dear lady , "" said Mme . Couture , addressing Mme . Vauquer , "" just imagine it ; he did not even ask Victorine to sit down , she was standing the whole time . He said to me quite coolly , without putting himself in a passion , that we might spare ourselves the trouble of going there ; that the young lady ( he would not call her his daughter ) was injuring her cause by importuning him ( _importuning ! _ once a year , the wretch ! ) ; that as Victorine's mother had nothing when he married her , Victorine ought not to expect anything from him ; in fact , he said the most cruel things , that made the poor child burst out crying . The little thing threw herself at her father's feet and spoke up bravely ; she said that she only persevered in her visits for her mother's sake ; that she would obey him without a murmur , but that she begged him to read her poor dead mother's farewell letter . She took it up and gave it to him , saying the most beautiful things in the world , most beautifully expressed ; I do not know where she learned them ; God must have put them into her head , for the poor child was inspired to speak so nicely that it made me cry like a fool to hear her talk . And what do you think the monster was doing all the time ? Cutting his nails ! He took the letter that poor Mme . Taillefer had soaked with tears , and flung it on to the chimney-piece . ' That is all right , ' he said . He held out his hands to raise his daughter , but she covered them with kisses , and he drew them away again . Scandalous , is n't it ? And his great booby of a son came in and took no notice of his sister . "" "" What inhuman wretches they must be ! "" said Father Goriot . "" And then they both went out of the room , "" Mme . Couture went on , without heeding the worthy vermicelli maker's exclamation ; "" father and son bowed to me , and asked me to excuse them on account of urgent business ! That is the history of our call . Well , he has seen his daughter at any rate . How he can refuse to acknowledge her I can not think , for they are as alike as two peas . "" The boarders dropped in one after another , interchanging greetings and empty jokes that certain classes of Parisians regard as humorous and witty . Dulness is their prevailing ingredient , and the whole point consists in mispronouncing a word or a gesture . This kind of argot is always changing . The essence of the jest consists in some catchword suggested by a political event , an incident in the police courts , a street song , or a bit of burlesque at some theatre , and forgotten in a month . Anything and everything serves to keep up a game of battledore and shuttlecock with words and ideas . The diorama , a recent invention , which carried an optical illusion a degree further than panoramas , had given rise to a mania among art students for ending every word with _rama_ . The Maison Vauquer had caught the infection from a young artist among the boarders . "" Well , Monsieur-r-r Poiret , "" said the _employe_ from the Museum , "" how is your health-orama ? "" Then , without waiting for an answer , he turned to Mme . Couture and Victorine with a "" Ladies , you seem melancholy . "" "" Is dinner ready ? "" cried Horace Bianchon , a medical student , and a friend of Rastignac's ; "" my stomach is sinking _usque ad talones_ . "" "" There is an uncommon _frozerama_ outside , "" said Vautrin . "" Make room there , Father Goriot ! Confound it , your foot covers the whole front of the stove . "" "" Illustrious M. Vautrin , "" put in Bianchon , "" why do you say _frozerama_ ? It is incorrect ; it should be _frozenrama_ . "" "" No , it should n ' t , "" said the official from the Museum ; "" _frozerama_ is right by the same rule that you say ' My feet are _froze_ . ' "" "" Ah ! ah ! "" "" Here is his Excellency the Marquis de Rastignac , Doctor of the Law of Contraries , "" cried Bianchon , seizing Eugene by the throat , and almost throttling him . "" Hallo there ! hallo ! "" Mlle . Michonneau came noiselessly in , bowed to the rest of the party , and took her place beside the three women without saying a word . "" That old bat always makes me shudder , "" said Bianchon in a low voice , indicating Mlle . Michonneau to Vautrin . "" I have studied Gall's system , and I am sure she has the bump of Judas . "" "" Then you have seen a case before ? "" said Vautrin . "" Who has not ? "" answered Bianchon . "" Upon my word , that ghastly old maid looks just like one of the long worms that will gnaw a beam through , give them time enough . "" "" That is the way , young man , "" returned he of the forty years and the dyed whiskers : "" The rose has lived the life of a rose -- A morning's space . "" "" Aha ! here is a magnificent _soupe-au-rama_ , "" cried Poiret as Christophe came in bearing the soup with cautious heed . "" I beg your pardon , sir , "" said Mme . Vauquer ; "" it is _soupe aux choux_ . "" All the young men roared with laughter . "" Had you there , Poiret ! "" "" Poir-r-r-rette ! she had you there ! "" "" Score two points to Mamma Vauquer , "" said Vautrin . "" Did any of you notice the fog this morning ? "" asked the official . "" It was a frantic fog , "" said Bianchon , "" a fog unparalleled , doleful , melancholy , sea-green , asthmatical--a Goriot of a fog ! "" "" A Goriorama , "" said the art student , "" because you could n ' t see a thing in it . "" "" Hey ! Milord Gaoriotte , they air talking about yoo-o-ou ! "" Father Goriot , seated at the lower end of the table , close to the door through which the servant entered , raised his face ; he had smelt at a scrap of bread that lay under his table napkin , an old trick acquired in his commercial capacity , that still showed itself at times . "" Well , "" Madame Vauquer cried in sharp tones , that rang above the rattle of spoons and plates and the sound of other voices , "" and is there anything the matter with the bread ? "" "" Nothing whatever , madame , "" he answered ; "" on the contrary , it is made of the best quality of corn ; flour from Etampes . "" "" How could you tell ? "" asked Eugene . "" By the color , by the flavor . "" "" You knew the flavor by the smell , I suppose , "" said Mme . Vauquer . "" You have grown so economical , you will find out how to live on the smell of cooking at last .

628,A11,"Work Opportunities - Ajay My name is Ajay and I have tried lots of jobs . I have done hairdressing for my school work experience . I really enjoyed it . I washed hair and swept the floor and made teas and coffees . I would also take appointments and payment from customers with some help from the staff . After college , I went to the job centre to see a Disability Employment Adviser ( DEA ) . The DEA told me about work and benefits . Some of it was really hard to understand . We talked about work-based training and she said she would look for a job for me . She told me it might take some time . I was out of work , so I had to go on a benefit called Job Seekers Allowance . I had to go to the job centre every 2 weeks to say that I was still looking for work . Then I went to a supported employment agency . The people at the supported employment agency were very nice to me , they asked me lots of questions about jobs I might like to do . They also gave me English and maths tests . They also wanted to know if I could count money and give out the correct change . I worked at Newco Products for 6 months . This work was similar to being in a factory . I learned new skills that could help me find a job at the end of training . I had to manufacture and assemble kitchen units . The placement was for 23 hours per week . On my first day I had to take along my bank details so that they could pay my wages straight into my bank account . I got paid every 2 weeks . They also explained what I should do if I was late for work or off sick . I had to ring the supervisor . I also had to book my holidays in advance so that they could make sure that everyone did n't take the same time off . When I had finished my training at Newco Products I went to do some more work experience at Matalan . I worked on different sections throughout the store . I helped with deliveries ; unpacking and putting out items . I also helped out in the fitting room and customer services . I worked every Monday and Tuesday . I started work at 10 . 00a . m . and I finished at 3 . 00p . m . I had a half-hour lunch break at 1 . 00p . m . I would take sandwiches and eat them in the staff room and play pool with other members of staff . When my work experience ended I asked the manager if I could work weekends but he said that they only had evening work available and I did n't want that . Then I started work for MacIntyre . I work for the Transition project and I am an illustrator . I am creating all the images to be used in the resource pack . I work for 14 hours a week in the office and at home . I get paid for this work so I had to have a meeting to stop all my benefits . I get paid monthly like everyone else . I really enjoy this work and I hope to continue with my illustration work when the project ends . </doc>

143,A11,"The value of nothing : out of nothing comes something . That was an essay I wrote when I was 11 years old and I got a B + . ( Laughter ) What I 'm going to talk about : nothing out of something , and how we create . And I 'm gonna try and do that within the 18-minute time span that we were told to stay within , and to follow the TED commandments : that is , actually , something that creates a near-death experience , but near-death is good for creativity . ( Laughter ) OK . So , I also want to explain , because Dave Eggers said he was going to heckle me if I said anything that was a lie , or not true to universal creativity . And I 've done it this way for half the audience , who is scientific . When I say we , I do n't mean you , necessarily ; I mean me , and my right brain , my left brain , and the one that 's in between that is the censor and tells me what I 'm saying is wrong . And I 'm going do that also by looking at what I think is part of my creative process , which includes a number of things that happened , actually -- the nothing started even earlier than the moment in which I 'm creating something new . And that includes nature , and nurture , and what I refer to as nightmares . Now in the nature area , we look at whether or not we are innately equipped with something , perhaps in our brains , some abnormal chromosome that causes this muse-like effect . And some people would say that we 're born with it in some other means , and others , like my mother , would say that I get my material from past lives . Some people would also say that creativity may be a function of some other neurological quirk -- van Gogh syndrome -- that you have a little bit of , you know , psychosis , or depression . I do have to say , somebody -- I read recently that van Gogh was n ' t really necessarily psychotic , that he might have had temporal lobe seizures , and that might have caused his spurt of creativity , and I do n't -- I suppose it does something in some part of your brain . And I will mention that I actually developed temporal lobe seizures a number of years ago , but it was during the time I was writing my last book , and some people say that book is quite different . I think that part of it also begins with a sense of identity crisis : you know , who am I , why am I this particular person , why am I not black like everybody else ? And sometimes you 're equipped with skills , but they may not be the kind of skills that enable creativity . I used to draw . I thought I would be an artist . And I had a miniature poodle . And it was n ' t bad , but it was n ' t really creative . Because all I could really do was represent in a very one-on-one way . And I have a sense that I probably copied this from a book . And then I also was n ' t really shining in a certain area that I wanted to be , and you know , you look at those scores , and it was n ' t bad , but it was not certainly predictive that I would one day make my living out of the artful arrangement of words . Also , one of the principles of creativity is to have a little childhood trauma . And I had the usual kind that I think a lot of people had , and that is that , you know , I had expectations placed on me . That figure right there , by the way , figure right there was a toy given to me when I was but nine years old , and it was to help me become a doctor from a very early age . I have some ones that were long lasting : from the age of five to 15 , this was supposed to be my side occupation , and it led to a sense of failure . But actually there was something quite real in my life that happened when I was about 14 . And it was discovered that my brother , in 1967 , and then my father , six months later , had brain tumors . And my mother believed that something had gone wrong , and she was gonna find out what it was . And she was gonna fix it . My father was a Baptist minister , and he believed in miracles , and that God's will would take care of that . But of course , they ended up dying , six months apart . And after that , my mother believed that it was fate , or curses -- she went looking through all the reasons in the universe why this would have happened . Everything except randomness . She did not believe in randomness . There was a reason for everything . And one of the reasons , she thought , was that her mother , who had died when she was very young , was angry at her . And so I had this notion of death all around me because my mother also believed that I would be next , and she would be next And when you are faced with the prospect of death very soon , you begin to think very much about everything . You become very creative , in a survival sense . And this , then , led to my big questions . And they 're the same ones that I have today . And they are : Why do things happen , and how do things happen ? And the one my mother asked : How do I make things happen ? It 's a wonderful way to look at these questions , when you write a story . Because after all , in that framework , between page one and 300 , you have to answer this question of why things happen , how things happen , in what order they happen . What are the influences ? How do I , as the narrator , as the writer , also influence that ? And it 's also one that I think many of our scientists have been asking . It 's a kind of cosmology , and I have to develop a cosmology of my own universe , as the creator of that universe . And you see , there 's a lot of back and forth in trying to make that happen , trying to figure it out -- years and years , oftentimes . So when I look at creativity , I also think that it is this sense or this inability to repress my looking at associations in practically anything in life . And I got a lot of them during what 's been going on throughout this conference , almost everything that 's been going on . And so I 'm going to use , as the metaphor , this association : quantum mechanics , which I really do n't understand , but I 'm still gonna use it as the process for explaining how it is the metaphor . So in quantum mechanics , of course , you have dark energy and dark matter . And it 's the same thing in looking at these questions of how things happen . There 's a lot of unknown , and you often do n't know what it is except by its absence . But when you make those associations , you want them to come together in a kind of synergy in the story , and what you 're finding is what matters . The meaning . And that 's what I look for in my work , a personal meaning . There is also the uncertainty principle , which is part of quantum mechanics , as I understand it . ( Laughter ) And this happens constantly in the writing . And there 's the terrible and dreaded observer effect , in which you 're looking for something , and you know , things are happening simultaneously , and you 're looking at it in a different way , and you 're trying to really look for the about-ness . Or what is this story about . And if you try too hard , then you will only write the about . You wo n ' t discover anything . And what you were supposed to find , what you hoped to find , in some serendipitous way , is no longer there . Now , I do n't want to ignore the other side of what happens in our universe , like many of our scientists have . And so I am going to just throw in string theory here , and just say that creative people are multi-dimensional , and there are eleven levels , I think , of anxiety . ( Laughter ) And they all operate at the same time . There is also a big question of ambiguity . And I would link that to something called the cosmological constant . And you do n't know what is operating , but something is operating there . And ambiguity , to me , is very uncomfortable in my life , and I have it . Moral ambiguity . It is constantly there . And just as an example , this is one that recently came to me . It was something I read in an editorial by a woman who was talking about the war in Iraq . And she said , "" Save a man from drowning , you are responsible to him for life . "" A very famous Chinese saying , she said . And that means because we went into Iraq , we should stay there until things were solved . You know , maybe even 100 years . So there was another one that I came across , and it 's "" saving fish from drowning . "" And it 's what Buddhist fishermen say , because they 're not supposed to kill anything . And they also have to make a living , and people need to be fed . So their way of rationalizing that is they are saving the fish from drowning , and unfortunately in the process the fish die . Now what 's encapsulated in both these drowning metaphors -- actually , one of them is my mother's interpretation , and it is a famous Chinese saying because she said it to me : "" Save a man from drowning , you are responsible to him for life . "" And it was a warning -- do n't get involved in other people's business , or you 're going to get stuck . OK . I think if somebody really was drowning , she 'd save them . But both of these sayings , saving a fish from drowning , or saving a man from drowning , to me they had to do with intentions . And all of us in life , when we see a situation , we have a response . And then we have intentions . There 's an ambiguity of what that should be that we should do , and then we do something . And the results of that may not match what our intentions had been . Maybe things go wrong . And so , after that , what are our responsibilities ? What are we supposed to do ? Do we stay in for life , or do we do something else and justify and say , well , my intentions were good , and therefore I can not be held responsible for all of it ? That is the ambiguity in my life that really disturbed me , and led me to write a book called Saving Fish From Drowning . I saw examples of that , once I identified this question . It was all over the place . I got these hints everywhere . And then , in a way , I knew that they had always been there . And then writing , that 's what happens . I get these hints , these clues , and I realize that they 've been obvious , and yet they have not been . And what I need , in effect , is a focus . And when I have the question , it is a focus . And all these things that seem to be flotsam and jetsam in life actually go through that question , and what happens is those particular things become relevant . And it seems like it 's happening all the time . You think there 's a sort of coincidence going on , a serendipity , in which you 're getting all this help from the universe . And it may also be explained that now you have a focus . And you are noticing it more often . But you apply this . You begin to look at things having to do with your tensions . Your brother , who 's fallen in trouble , do you take care of him ? Why or why not ? It may be something that is perhaps more serious -- as I said , human rights in Burma . I was thinking that I should n ' t go because somebody said if I did , it would show that I approved of the military regime there . And then after a while , I had to ask myself , "" Why do we take on knowledge , why do we take on assumptions that other people have given us ? "" And it was the same thing that I felt when I was growing up , and was hearing these rules of moral conduct from my father , who was a Baptist minister . So I decided that I would go to Burma for my own intentions , and still did n't know that if I went there , what the result of that would be if I wrote a book -- and I just would have to face that later , when the time came . We are all concerned with things that we see in the world that we are aware of . We come to this point and say , what do I as an individual do ? Not all of us can go to Africa , or work at hospitals , so what do we do if we have this moral response , this feeling ? Also , I think one of the biggest things we are all looking at , and we talked about today , is genocide . This leads to this question , when I look at all these things that are morally ambiguous and uncomfortable , and I consider what my intentions should be , I realize it goes back to this identity question that I had when I was a child -- and why am I here , and what is the meaning of my life , and what is my place in the universe ? It seems so obvious , and yet it is not . We all hate moral ambiguity in some sense , and yet it is also absolutely necessary . In writing a story , it is the place where I begin . Sometimes I get help from the universe , it seems . My mother would say it was the ghost of my grandmother from the very first book , because it seemed I knew things I was not supposed to know . Instead of writing that the grandmother died accidentally , from an overdose of opium while having too much of a good time , I actually put down in the story that the woman killed herself , and that actually was the way it happened . And my mother decided that that information must have come from my grandmother . There are also things , quite uncanny , which bring me information that will help me in the writing of the book . In this case , I was writing a story that included some kind of detail , period of history , a certain location . And I needed to find something historically that would match that . And I took down this book , and I -- first page that I flipped it to was exactly the setting , and the time period . And the kind of character I needed was the Taiping rebellion , happening in the area near Guilin , outside of that , and a character who thought he was the son of God . You wonder , are these things random chance ? Well , what is random ? What is chance ? What is luck ? What are things that you get from the universe that you ca n ' t really explain ? And that goes into the story too . These are the things I constantly think about from day to day . Especially when good things happen , and in particular , when bad things happen . But I do think there 's a kind of serendipity , and I do want to know what those elements are , so I can thank them , and also try to find them in my life . Because , again , I think that when I am aware of them , more of them happen . Another chance encounter is when I went to a place -- I just was with some friends , and we drove randomly to a different place , and we ended up in this non-tourist location , a beautiful village , pristine . And we walked three valleys beyond , and the third valley , there was something quite mysterious and ominous , a discomfort I felt . And then I knew that had to be setting of my book . And in writing one of the scenes , it happened in that third valley . For some reason I wrote about cairns -- stacks of rocks -- that a man was building . And I did n't know exactly why I had it , but it was so vivid . I got stuck , and a friend , when she asked if I would go for a walk with her dogs , that I said , sure . And about 45 minutes later , walking along the beach , I came across this . And it was a man , a Chinese man , and he was stacking these things , not with glue , not with anything . And I asked him how is it possible to do this ? And he said , well , I guess with everything in life , there 's a place of balance . And this was exactly the meaning of my story at that point . I had so many examples -- I have so many instances like this when I 'm writing a story , and I can not explain it . Is it because I had the filter that I have such a strong coincidence in writing about these things ? Or is it a kind of serendipity that we can not explain , like the cosmological constant ? A big thing that I also think about is accidents . And as I said , my mother did not believe in randomness . What is the nature of accidents ? And how are we going to assign what the responsibility and the causes are , outside of a court of law ? I was able to see that in a firsthand way , when I went to beautiful Dong village , in Guizhou , the poorest province of China . And I saw this beautiful place . I knew I wanted to come back . And I had a chance to do that when National Geographic asked me if I wanted to write anything about China . And I said yes , about this village of Singing people , Singing minority . And they agreed , and between the time I saw this place and the next time I went , there was a terrible accident . A man , an old man , fell asleep , and his quilt dropped in a pan of fire that kept him warm . 60 homes were destroyed , and 40 were damaged . Responsibility was assigned to the family . The man's sons were banished to live three kilometers away , in a cow shed . And of course , as Westerners , we say , "" Well , it was an accident . That 's not fair . It 's the son , not the father . "" And when I go on a story , I have to let go of those kinds of beliefs . It takes a while , but I have to let go of them and just go there , and be there . And so I was there on three occasions , different seasons . And I began to sense something different about the history and what had happened before , and the nature of life in a very poor village , and what you find as your joys , and your rituals , your traditions , your links with other families . And I saw how this had a kind of justice in its responsibility . I was able to find out also about the ceremony that they were using , a ceremony they had n ' t used in about 29 years . And it was to send some men -- a Feng Shui master sent men down to the underworld on ghost horses . Now you , as Westerners , and I , as Westerners , would say well , that 's superstition . But after being there for a while , and seeing the amazing things that happened , you begin to wonder whose beliefs are those that are in operation in the world , determining how things happen . So I remained with them , and the more I wrote that story , the more I got in to those beliefs , and I think that 's important for me -- to take on the beliefs , because that is where the story is real , and that is where I 'm gonna find the answers to how I feel about certain questions that I have in life . Years go by , of course , and the writing , it does n ' t happen instantly , as I 'm trying to convey it to you here at TED . The book comes and it goes . When it arrives , it is no longer my book . It is in the hands of readers , and they interpret it differently . But I go back to this question of , how do I create something out of nothing ? And how do I create my own life ? And I think it is by questioning , and saying to myself that there are no absolute truths . I believe in specifics , the specifics of story , and the past , the specifics of that past , and what is happening in the story at that point . I also believe that in thinking about things , my thinking about luck , and fate , and coincidences and accidents , God's will , and the synchrony of mysterious forces , I will come to some notion of what that is , how we create . I have to think of my role . Where I am in the universe , and did somebody intend for me to be that way , or is it just something I came up with ? And I also can find that by imagining fully , and becoming what is imagined , and yet is in that real world , the fictional world . And that is how I find particles of truth , not the absolute truth , or the whole truth . And they have to be in all possibilities , including those I never considered before . So there are never complete answers . Or rather , if there is an answer , it is to remind myself that there is uncertainty in everything , and that is good . Because then I will discover something new . And if there is a partial answer , a more complete answer from me , it is to simply imagine . And to imagine is to put myself in that story , until there was only -- there is a transparency between me and the story I am creating . And that 's how I 've discovered that if I feel what is in the story -- in one story -- then I come the closest , I think , to knowing what compassion is , to feeling that compassion . Because for everything , in that question of how things happen , it has to do with the feeling . I have to become the story in order to understand a lot of that . We 've come to the end of the talk , and I will reveal what is in the bag , and it is the muse , and it is the things that transform in our lives , that are wonderful and stay with us . There she is . Thank you very much ! ( Applause ) </content> </doc>

1540,A7,"Search form Burns and scalds : how to handle Burns and scalds are a major cause of injury , including serious injury , in children up to the age of 14 – and little children are most at risk , says Kidsafe . Burns and scalds are one of the topics covered in Elastoplast's First Aid Guide , which covers what parents should – and should n't – do when their child suffers a minor burn or scald . ' There is an increased risk of infection with burns and scalds because damage to the skin reduces protection against bacteria , ' the Guide says . Burns can be categorised as : deep partial thickness , which causes mottled red or white skin with blistering and some damage to blood supply and sensation ; and full thickness , which results in white , tan or black skin that 's dry and leathery . This means major damage to blood supply and sensation . Mike Berry , business unit manager at Beiersdorf , which supplies Elastoplast , says it 's important that pharmacy assistants know when to refer concerned parents to seek further medical advice . ' We refer to burns as minor burns if they 're smaller than about the size of a 20 cent coin , as the Elastoplast First Aid booklet states , ' says Mike . If there 's anything sticking to the burn , such as clothing , do n't try to remove it yourself – seek medical advice . A small , superficial and lightly weeping burn can be treated by using a self-adhesive island dressing , such as Elastoplast Antibacterial . </doc>

1126,A17,"Man Booker Prize 2016 winner Paul Beatty 's The Sellout is an outrageous racial satire – review W hen Barack Obama became President of the United States , many hoped the nation's racial traumas might start to heal . Instead , his presidency has exposed disturbing bigotry and anger , notably in this election year . For African-American writers this paradox is a particular problem . How to write literature dramatising racial oppression when a black man is in the White House ? The approach of Paul Beatty , born in 1962 in Los Angeles , is to throw caution to the wind . His fourth novel , The Sellout , is an outrageous scattergun satire taking aim at racism and what racism has done to black Americans . Earlier this year , it won the National Book Critics Circle Award , and is now on the Man Booker Prize shortlist . The Sellout aims to do for race relations what Joseph Heller's Catch-22 – a favourite novel of Beatty's – did for the Second World War . Paul Beatty becomes first US author to win the Man Booker prize with racial satire The Sellout Play ! 00 : 32 T he novel begins with our narrator Bonbon on trial at the Supreme Court . His opening line : "" This may be hard to believe , coming from a black man , but I 've never stolen anything . "" It 's a fair reflection of the book 's gleefully provocative tone . What he is actually on trial for is – wait for it – trying to reinstitute slavery and segregation in his Los Angeles suburb . T he ghetto is called Dickens ( a nod to another literary inspiration ) and resembles the real-life Compton . Bonbon was raised by a single father , a thoughtful man who specialises in quietly calming down angry black men . After his father is shot dead by police , Bonbon is on his own . Consumed by guilt and anger , he takes on an ageing black actor and makes him his slave . The twisted logic ( if there is one ) is that to become successful , he needs to become "" white "" , and to do that he must first dominate another black person . His painful comic riffs on what it means to be accepted by mainstream ( in other words , white ) culture are the book's highlight : "" I was the ' diversity ' the school trumpeted so loudly in its glossy literature , but there was n't enough financial aid in the world to get me to suck the gristle from a leg bone in front of the entire freshman class . "" Beatty is just as harsh on the foibles of black America : "" I did n't ruin his dreams by telling him that black people do all think alike . They wo n't admit it , but every black person thinks they 're better than every other black person . "" One of the funniest characters is a permanently outraged academic called Foy Cheshire , who re-writes Huckleberry Finn replacing the "" repugnant ' n-word ' "" with "" warrior "" , and "" slave "" with "" dark-skinned volunteer "" . At one point , Bonbon confesses that he fell asleep while reading Toni Morrison's Paradise , a novel about an all-black town in Fifties America . But clearly he takes some inspiration from it , hence his devilish plan to reinstate black pride by segregating the races . "" Apartheid united black South Africa , why could n't it do the same for Dickens ? "" he asks . B eatty's sharp humour challenges pieties from all sides , while never losing sight of the fundamental issue : America's racism and the legacy of slavery . Intelligent and entertaining as it is , though , I 'm not sure The Sellout adds up to a novel . It 's more a series of stand-up routines stitched together , the author barely drawing breath before the next joke . It 's exhilarating but exhausting . The reader is left little time to reflect and must largely do without the traditional pleasures of a novel – well-made characters and a consistent plot . I 'm not sure Beatty cares . His novel takes cracks at the expense of more conventional authors , whom he mocks for performing to white audiences . But his own novel is on the dangerous path to success – a literary double-bind encapsulated in the title . If Beatty's book is likely to sell out , must he also have sold out ? The novel ends , appropriately , at a stand-up show . The narrator sees a black comedian berating a white couple for laughing at jokes aimed at his community . "" Get out , "" he says . "" This is our thing . "" Beatty seems to be asking : is it all right for non-black people to laugh at The Sellout ? Bonbon's answer is , characteristically , also a question : "" So what exactly is our thing ? "" The Sellout is published by Oneworld at £ 12 . 99 .

237,A1,"Agenda Post-conflict peacebuilding The meeting was called to order at 9.45 a . m . Adoption of the agenda The agenda was adopted . Post-conflict peacebuilding The President ( spoke in Russian ) : I should like to inform the Council that I have received letters from the representatives of Afghanistan , Argentina , Brazil , Canada , Chile , Croatia , Egypt , El Salvador , Germany , Guatemala , Jamaica , Japan , Nigeria , the Republic of Korea , Senegal and Uruguay , in which they request to be invited to participate in the consideration of the item on the Council's agenda . In conformity with the usual practice , I propose , with the consent of the Council , to invite those representatives to participate in the consideration of the item , without the right to vote , in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Charter and rule 37 of the Council's provisional rules of procedure . There being no objection , it is so decided . At the invitation of the President , the representatives of the aforementioned countries took the seats reserved for them at the side of the Council Chamber . The President ( spoke in Russian ) : In accordance with the understanding reached among Council members , I am pleased to invite the following participants under rule 39 of the provisional rules of procedure of the Security Council : His Excellency Mr. Dalius Čekuolis , President of the Economic and Social Council ; His Excellency Mr. Ismael Abraão Gaspar Martins , Chairman of the Organizational Committee of the Peacebuilding Commission ; Ms. Carolyn McAskie , Assistant Secretary-General in the Peacebuilding Support Office ; Mr. Oscar Avalle , Special Representative of the World Bank to the United Nations ; and Mr. Reinhard Munzberg , Special Representative of the International Monetary Fund to the United Nations . Also in accordance with the understanding reached among Council members , I am pleased to invite the following participants under rule 37 of the provisional rules of procedure of the Security Council : the Permanent Representative of Burundi , His Excellency Mr. Joseph Ntakirutimana ; the Permanent Representative of the Netherlands , His Excellency Mr. Frank Majoor ; the Permanent Representative of Norway , His Excellency Mr. Johan Løvald ; and the Deputy Permanent Representative of Sierra Leone , His Excellency Mr. Sylvester Ekundayo Rowe . At the invitation of the President , Mr. Ntakirutimana ( Burundi ) , Mr. Majoor ( the Netherlands ) , Mr. Løvald ( Norway ) and Mr. Rowe ( Sierra Leone ) took the seats reserved for them at the side of the Council Chamber . The President ( spoke in Russian ) : The Security Council will now begin consideration of the item on its agenda . The Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its prior consultations . This morning's meeting of the Security Council deals with one of the most significant challenges on the agenda of the United Nations – that is , how to help countries emerging from crisis to overcome the consequences of conflict , to prevent the renewal of those conflicts and to put those countries on the path to sustainable development . It was for this very reason that it was decided at the United Nations summit in 2005 to create the Peacebuilding Commission . The beginning of the Commission's work was one of the most important and tangible achievements reached by Member States in the reform of the Organization . We hope that the discussion in the Security Council and the forthcoming discussion in the General Assembly will give additional impetus to a mutually supportive partnership between these two organs and among all those who are contributing to the peacebuilding process , and that it will facilitate the constructive work of the Peacebuilding Commission . In accordance with the understanding reached among Council members , I should like to remind all speakers to limit their statements to no more than five minutes in order to enable the Council to carry out its work expeditiously . Speakers with lengthy statements are kindly requested to circulate their texts in the Chamber and to deliver a condensed version when speaking . I shall now give the floor to the President of the Economic and Social Council , His Excellency Mr. Dalius Čekuolis . Mr. Čekuolis : I wish to thank the Russian presidency of the Council for convening today's meeting and for inviting me to this debate , which , together with other relevant steps , will help us to improve the contributions of the United Nations bodies to the success of the Peacebuilding Commission , in line with their specific competencies and mandates . Time and again it has been noted that there is a strong correlation between low levels of development and violent conflict . Nine out of 10 countries with the lowest human development indicators have experienced conflict at some point or another since 1990 . According to World Bank estimates , a civil war lasts at least seven years on average , with the growth rate of the local economy reduced by 2.2 per cent each year . This downward spiral of poverty , conflict and added impoverishment is difficult to reverse . In broader terms , given the linkage between development , peace and security , more focused efforts should be made to advance and oversee the implementation of internationally agreed goals , including the Millennium Development Goals . The Economic and Social Council was given the mandate by the 2005 World Summit to focus on this implementation through its annual ministerial reviews . In doing so , the Council intends to continually assess how conflict is affecting the implementation of the United Nations development agenda . International assistance can play a major role in addressing the challenges faced by conflict-prone countries and in filling some of their capacity gaps . The recommendations made by experts on the volume and sustainability of international aid to fragile States and countries emerging from conflicts , therefore , deserve our full consideration . In particular , research suggests that the optimal period for absorbing increased aid is about six years after a peace settlement , by which time donors tend to move on to another country in crisis . The Economic and Social Council is ready to assist the Peacebuilding Commission in utilizing these insights in its plans and activities . We believe that our respective intergovernmental bodies should exchange views , analyses and policy recommendations on these and other matters . Another example of the perspectives the Economic and Social Council can share with the Peacebuilding Commission is related , for instance , to policy actions on youth employment , because unemployed young people in countries where this phenomenon is massive are an easy target for recruitment into armed groups . As recently as last year , the Council considered the issue and developed policy recommendations regarding the mainstreaming of youth employment into national development plans and development cooperation programmes . The Council continues to be concerned about the situation in some regions of the world , particularly in Africa and the Middle East , where the two phenomena of youth unemployment and conflict continue to feed on each other . Through increased interaction and readiness to share relevant experience , we can contribute to strengthening the value added by the Peacebuilding Commission . In this respect , the Economic and Social Council is ready to share its lessons learned , especially given that the pioneering work of the Council's ad hoc advisory groups on countries emerging from conflict was , in a way , a forerunner of this qualitatively new organ – the Peacebuilding Commission , a body meant to ensure an integrated approach to peacebuilding on the basis of the links between security , development , rule of law and human rights . The Economic and Social Council's Ad Hoc Advisory Groups on Haiti , Guinea-Bissau and Burundi have been successful in promoting coordinated support to post-conflict countries through a comprehensive approach to relief , peace and development . In an effort to assess and constantly improve its work , the Council has carried out a lessons-learned exercise through the experience of the ad hoc advisory groups , including the one on Burundi , which is now being considered by the Peacebuilding Commission . I would like to share some of these lessons learned with members of the Security Council . First of all , the experience of the Ad Hoc Advisory Groups on Burundi and Guinea-Bissau highlighted the need for appropriate mechanisms to mobilize donors and to promote the translation of pledges into disbursements . Secondly , there is a need to go beyond immediate problem-solving in the countries considered to defining , from the very beginning , a vision towards longer-term rehabilitation and support , in order to ensure that assistance is sustainable and is not undermined by organizational and functional problems encountered on the ground . Thirdly , the international community should maintain concrete development support to a country in question , even when factors on the ground – for example , an electoral process – may incline donors to adopt a "" wait and see "" approach . Fourthly , it is essential to make good coordinated use of the work of United Nations entities to complement the policy approach of the intergovernmental body through strong support at the technical and operational level . Fifthly and finally , a good articulation must be ensured between United Nations actors and regional partners of the countries concerned , including regional and subregional organizations , regional development banks and the United Nations Regional Commissions . These and other lessons emerging from the continued work of the Economic and Social Council's ad hoc advisory groups can be further discussed and brought to bear on the future work of the Peacebuilding Commission . We hope that we can further explore practical modalities for interaction between the Economic and Social Council and the Peacebuilding Commission , in line with General Assembly resolutions . Our common objective should be to mobilize the whole institutional machinery of the United Nations to promote across-the-range policy approaches and best practices to develop answers to the complex and difficult needs of post-conflict countries and prevent their relapse into conflict . The meeting today is a good step in that direction . For its part , the Economic and Social Council is ready to contribute to the best of its ability , collectively or through its individual members on the Peacebuilding Commission's Organizational Committee , to developing the strategic goals and defining a viable peacebuilding strategy of the Commission , thereby ensure its lasting added value . The President ( spoke in Russian ) : I thank Mr. Čekuolis for his statement . I shall now give the floor to the Chairman of the Organizational Committee of the Peacebuilding Commission , His Excellency Mr. Ismael Abraão Gaspar Martins . Mr. Gaspar Martins : Mr. President , I am pleased and wish to thank you and the Russian presidency for the opportunity to participate in this meeting on the work of the Peacebuilding Commission in my capacity as Chairman of that Commission . This is indeed an important occasion to reflect on the work of the Peacebuilding Commission with one of the principal bodies that created it , through its resolution 1645 ( 2005 ) . I am equally pleased that the General Assembly has scheduled for 6 February a similar debate , which I hope will provide an opportunity for the wider participation of the membership of our Organization – a fact which we in the Peacebuilding Commission welcome . Although the Peacebuilding Commission has been in existence for less than a year , questions are already being asked about the results it has achieved during that period . That is a legitimate concern and it speaks to the high expectations that the international community , in particular the Member States , have for that new organ of the United Nations . Yet , we should recognize that peacebuilding is by nature a complex and long-term process which requires persistent and long-term commitment by all . This debate today will , I hope , contribute to mobilizing the commitment needed so that we can move faster , providing more clarity in the discussion of some outstanding procedural issues in the workings of the Commission . Let us all agree that our theoretical differences in New York are meaningless to those who are directly suffering from the consequences of conflict on the ground . What matters for them are concrete actions and not just eloquent statements . The Peacebuilding Commission will be relevant and succeed only if it paves the way for an engaged partnership and practical actions by its members , as well as by the donor community , regional organizations , multilateral financial institutions and the Governments , civil society and private sectors of countries under consideration by the Peacebuilding Commission . It is that active partnership that will produce the incremental and tangible results we are seeking . Our common efforts are and should be aimed at reinforcing confidence in post-conflict communities , ensuring that countries do not relapse into conflict and that they move swiftly on the path to stability , recovery and development . The fact that allocations were made from the Peacebuilding Fund for both Burundi and Sierra Leone is an important first step in underlining international commitment and attention . That will certainly have a catalyzing effect , but we do need a long-term commitment from donors to remain engaged with the countries throughout the peacebuilding effort . Equally , the two countries need to make greater efforts to lay the foundations for sustainable peace . I am particularly pleased that we are about to decide on country-specific plans of action and a programme of action for the Organizational Committee , which I believe will allow the Commission to review and monitor the implementation of its decisions on a more regular basis . The recent staffing of the Peacebuilding Support Office is also a welcome development . The Office should continue to be given the necessary attention and resources , as it constitutes a vital instrument for the functioning of the Commission . I am pleased by the contributions recently made to the Peacebuilding Fund . That is an encouraging trend , though the amount available is still insufficient when compared to the needs of the two countries and the urgency of meeting those needs . The Peacebuilding Commission is a body to which the Council has dedicated much valuable time to establishing . It is the Council's body , and it will perform only in accordance with the means that the Council and the international community put at its disposal in order to meet the high expectations of the populations of countries emerging from conflict . In order to meet the objectives expected from it on the ground , the Commission must be a real bridge for all stakeholders to marshal resources and to advise on and propose integrated strategies for post-conflict peacebuilding and recovery , in conformity with the decision made by the heads of State at the September Summit . I would like to seize this opportunity to commend the Governments of Burundi and Sierra Leone for providing a legal and political framework by establishing national bodies and a suitable environment to facilitate the work of the Commission on the ground . That is their primary responsibility and the role of national ownership . As stated by former Secretary-General Kofi Annan , "" [ w ] here peacebuilding succeeds it is always the leadership of domestic actors that is the essential ingredient of success . No amount of international engagement can substitute for domestic political leaders shouldering their responsibilities and leading their people towards peace and development "" ( A / 61 / 1 , para . Finally , I want to acknowledge the fact that the new body has a number of issues to address in order to improve its effectiveness and enhance its impact . While we have to acknowledge that the Peacebuilding Commission is still in the early phase of its existence , we also need to be decisive in tackling some of the critical challenges in relation to its working methods and strategic vision . That requires a collective commitment , and I hope that , as we move forward , all members of the Commission and of the United Nations will contribute to that effort . The President ( spoke in Russian ) : I thank Mr. Gaspar Martins for his statement . I shall now give the floor to the Assistant Secretary-General in the Peacebuilding Support Office , Ms. Carolyn McAskie . Ms. McAskie : I thank the Security Council for the opportunity to be here today . I am very pleased to provide a short statement in my capacity as head of the Peacebuilding Support Office . The links between the Commission and the Security Council , the General Assembly and the Economic and Social Council are critical , and I know that members of the Commission are exploring how to make the relationships among and between those bodies as effective as possible . How to deal with the critical post-conflict period has escaped our collective best efforts , despite several attempts to address the issue through transitional mechanisms . The creation of those new mechanisms – the Peacebuilding Commission , the Peacebuilding Support Office and the Peacebuilding Fund – offers a new opportunity to address that critical and fragile period in the life of a country ravaged by conflict . For that to happen , the Peacebuilding Commission has an important role to play in bringing all the actors together . That means that it must and will take on board the work of the Council , as well as that of the Economic and Social Council , the General Assembly , the United Nations agencies and all the partners , be they the financial institutions and other donors , the regional players , internal actors – such as civil society – and any others , as appropriate . That does not mean duplication ; that does not mean overlap . Rather , it is the strategic way in which the Commission will work by bringing everyone together . There is general agreement that , if it is to be most effective , the work must play out at the country level . The test of relevance for all of us will be to apply that approach in a way that will bring results for Burundi and Sierra Leone , in the first instance , and others as time goes on . The Chair and the Vice-Chairs will be working closely over the next several weeks with members of the Commission and with the Governments of Burundi and Sierra Leone to frame the next stage of the Commission's work , building on the first round of work accomplished so far . For its part , the Support Office will do everything it can to support the Commission in that important work . The Office must work with the players in the United Nations system , both in the field and at Headquarters , to ensure that the strategies of the Commission are applied to all relevant areas of the United Nations work . An important part of the Commission's mandate will be to marshal resources . While we all agree that the Peacebuilding Commission is not another donor forum , its work should generate significant additional resources for countries committed to staying on track for peace , to prevent their becoming , once again , the forgotten crises . The Secretary-General just announced , a few days ago , the first allocation under the Peacebuilding Fund – $ 35 million for Burundi – and will soon make an announcement regarding Sierra Leone . The Fund , however , can act only as a catalyst . Alone , it can not address the peacebuilding resource needs of countries emerging from conflict . The role of the Peacebuilding Commission in marshalling resources will be much broader , although the Peacebuilding Fund – which has been set up rapidly and which has attracted very significant contributions from donors – is an extremely useful start . It is only by bringing all the actors together that the Peacebuilding Commission can fulfil its mandate to advise on and propose integrated strategies for peacebuilding and to identify critical elements of peacebuilding in the countries under its consideration , bringing them together under an integrated strategic approach . It is in that way that the Commission can work inclusively to define its own objectives , enter into agreements with the countries under its consideration and provide guidance to the various actors as to how they can meet the broad goals of peacebuilding across the range of political , security , human rights and economic and social interventions – always under the lead of the country concerned itself . As I said , my Office is committed to supporting the Commission and the overall efforts of the international community in that important endeavour , including through extracting lessons learned and becoming the repository for peacebuilding advice within the United Nations Secretariat . We are now closer to completing the staffing requirements for that stage of the Office's work , and will continue to discuss with members of the Commission their vision for the work of the Support Office , in particular in the context of this year's budget discussions . Under the leadership of El Salvador , in its capacity as Vice-Chair of the Peacebuilding Commission , work on lessons learned will begin soon , with the establishment of a working group that will include broad participation by all Commission members . In the long run , peacebuilding must not be another layer of work for Governments or the United Nations or donors on the ground . Instead , it should define the way in which we frame our interventions to ensure that we can most effectively respond to the immediate needs of a post-conflict society and keep hard-won peace processes on a sustainable track . The President ( spoke in Russian ) : I thank Ms. McAskie for her statement . I now give the floor to Mr. Johan Løvald , Permanent Representative of Norway . Mr. Løvald ( Norway ) : Today's discussion – like the subsequent discussion in the General Assembly on 6 February – is an important occasion to highlight the importance of peacebuilding . We must maintain and , if possible , further increase the momentum behind our peacebuilding efforts . While our focus at all times must be on concrete results at the country level , we are all also conscious of the importance of this endeavour for the United Nations and the international community as a whole . Since entering office , the Government of Burundi has embarked on a series of planning and consultation processes in order to prepare development strategies to move Burundi from an emergency situation to a more normal pattern of development . Those strategies include the Government's emergency programme , the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper , the United Nations Common Humanitarian Action Plan and Joint Road Map and the United Nations Development Assistance Framework . Finally , I should also mention the establishment by the Government of Burundi of a joint Government-United Nations peacebuilding committee . Thus , much is already being done at the country level . Burundi has made progress in consolidating peace . However , the situation is still fragile , and continued international support is needed . The Peacebuilding Commission held two meetings on the situation in Burundi last fall . The Government of Burundi participated actively at the ministerial level on both occasions . I should like to thank the Government of Burundi for the very close cooperation extended to the Peacebuilding Commission , including myself , during my visit to Bujumbura last fall . The identification of priorities for peacebuilding and how to address them was the focus of those two country-specific meetings . At the first country-specific meeting three main critical peacebuilding challenges were identified in Burundi , namely : promoting good governance , strengthening the rule of law and the security sector and ensuring community recovery . Based on those critical challenges , a number of important peacebuilding priorities were identified . Among other things , those included strengthening national dialogue , continued efforts to include women in the consolidation of peace , sustained political support from countries in the region and strengthening of the Government's ability to deliver on basic services , inter alia through budgetary support . The Peacebuilding Commission's engagement with Burundi is now entering a new phase . The Commission will , in the near future , finalize its work plan and commence work on an integrated approach to peacebuilding , clearly outlining Burundi's commitments and the response to be provided by the international community in critical areas . At the same time , we should continue to work with the Government to monitor progress in the critical areas already identified . In that regard , I would like to welcome the decision by the second Summit of the International Conference on the Great Lakes Region to establish a regional follow-up mechanism – to include a Conference secretariat – and to establish its offices in Bujumbura . I am sure that the Peacebuilding Commission would like to discuss how we can also support peacebuilding in that regional perspective . On 29 January , at the African Union Summit held in Addis Ababa , the Secretary-General formally announced a Peacebuilding Fund country envelope of $ 35 million for Burundi . I welcome that development . In the Peacebuilding Commission , we must now decide how we can build on that and achieve a catalytic effect . We recognize , of course , that funding through the Peacebuilding Fund can only provide initial support . Much more will be needed from other sources . Donor per capita assistance to Burundi remains low . The international community must support national efforts to address the priorities and gaps identified by the Government . The upcoming donors' round table to be held at Bujumbura from 15 to 16 March will provide an opportunity to respond to those challenges . The Peacebuilding Commission would obviously like to consider that event and discuss how integrated peacebuilding efforts can complement the results of the round table . Let me also offer a very brief national point of view . We are humbled by the enormous challenges facing Burundi . The Norwegian Government is committed to doing what it can in order to achieve durable peace and economic development . The visit to Burundi by Norway's Minister for Development Cooperation last month laid the groundwork for a bilateral programme in support of development and peacebuilding . In consequence , Norway will in the near future establish an embassy in Bujumbura . To sum up , successful peacebuilding will necessitate sustained political and material support in the years to come , from all stakeholders : the United Nations system , the international financial institutions , donors , civil society and regional actors . Similarly , continued national ownership will be key , based on an inclusive approach within which all relevant segments of society can contribute . The President ( spoke in Russian ) : I thank Mr. Løvald for his statement . I now give the floor to Mr. Frank Majoor , Permanent Representative of the Netherlands . Mr. Majoor ( Netherlands ) : I very much welcome this opportunity , early in the new year , to participate in the Security Council's discussion on the Peacebuilding Commission , and to do so in my capacity as Chairperson of the Commission's country-specific meeting on Sierra Leone . Allow me to refer to my statement before the Security Council made on 22 December 2006 ( see S / PV . 5608 ) , when I was invited to brief Council members on the outcome of the country-specific meetings on Sierra Leone that had taken place in October and December 2006 . While various activities have been ongoing in Sierra Leone itself , as well as at an informal level within the Peacebuilding Commission , I believe that my 22 December statement still very much reflects the state of play as concerns the Commission's involvement with Sierra Leone . Allow me , therefore , to refrain from repeating the overview that I presented at that time and instead make a number of additional remarks that may feed into today's discussions . First , I very much welcome the interest shown by the Security Council in the activities of the Peacebuilding Commission , as demonstrated by today's debate . The same is true for the interest shown by other bodies within the United Nations , such as the General Assembly – which intends to discuss the Commission's work next week – and the Economic and Social Council , and by those outside the United Nations . Today represents a good opportunity to strengthen our common focus on our shared interests , that is , to assist Sierra Leone and Burundi – as the first countries under consideration – in building peace and in preventing any possible relapse into conflict . Secondly , I wish to stress that good progress has been made in Sierra Leone in addressing the identified gaps in critical areas . Allow me to highlight just a few recent developments . A national steering committee on peacebuilding has been established by the Government of Sierra Leone and the United Nations to relate to the work of the Peacebuilding Commission and the Peacebuilding Fund . It will bring together Government , the United Nations , donors and civil society representatives to jointly address peacebuilding priorities . Also in Sierra Leone , consultations are ongoing to finalize the priority plan for funding from the Peacebuilding Fund . Once the review process stipulated in the terms of reference for the Fund is completed , it is expected that a country envelope in excess of the initially indicated $ 25 million will be made available . At the Peacebuilding Commission's most recent country-specific meeting on Sierra Leone , members of the Commission urged the international community to lend support to the Government of Sierra Leone in order to broaden its donor base and secure assistance , including further debt relief . I am pleased to note that the World Bank's International Development Association and the International Monetary Fund have agreed that Sierra Leone has made sufficient progress to reach the completion point under the enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative . The Commission also called on the international community to provide , in a timely manner , adequate resources and support for the upcoming presidential and parliamentary elections , including capacity-building to ensure women's equal participation in the political process . In this area a great deal of progress has been observed . The initial resource gap of $ 7 million for the election has been reduced to less than $ 3 million , with further pledges expected . Progress has been made in establishing an independent National Electoral Commission to prepare credible elections . The signing of an electoral code of conduct by eight political parties , the strengthening of the Sierra Leone police and the countrywide discussions on a media code of conduct for electoral reporting are other examples of progress . Finally , allow me to revert to the process of the Peacebuilding Commission's discussions in New York . Next week , members of the country-specific meetings on Sierra Leone will discuss a work plan for the work of the Commission on Sierra Leone . This work plan is to guide our activities in the coming months leading up to the next country-specific meeting on Sierra Leone , due to take place in March or April . It sets a timeline and defines the actions to be undertaken by the Sierra Leone Government , the United Nations system and other stakeholders . Ownership , especially at the national level , and close coordination between New York and national actors are crucial . A key focus of the work of the Commission on Sierra Leone in these coming months will be the development of an integrated approach to outline clearly the commitments made by the Government of Sierra Leone and the international community . I am confident that in the spirit that has guided the Commission's discussions thus far , we will be able to continue to engage in meaningful discussions in the country-specific meetings on Sierra Leone and , in the process , contribute to the building of peace in Sierra Leone . It will require the involvement of all the stakeholders : the Government of Sierra Leone , the full membership of the Peacebuilding Commission , potential other donors , the United Nations country team and the individual United Nations bodies on the ground , non-governmental organizations , civil society and the private sector . It will also require continued support by the Security Council , and I therefore very much welcome the Council's continued engagement regarding the Peacebuilding Commission and Sierra Leone in particular . The President ( spoke in Russian ) : I shall now give the floor to Mr. Oscar Avalle , Special Representative of the World Bank to the United Nations . Mr. Avalle ( spoke in Spanish ) : It is a privilege to address the Security Council on behalf of the World Bank during this open debate on post-conflict peacebuilding . I wish to reaffirm the full support and commitment of the World Bank to the work of the Peacebuilding Commission , in all its aspects and at all levels . As members of the international community , we can not afford to ignore the urgent problems currently faced by countries in crisis . It is our obligation to speedily provide the urgent assistance necessary to respond to the needs of those countries . In this context , we believe that the United Nations system plays a critical role in conflict prevention and resolution , but we can not forget that after the conflict is over the work must continue , with support for reconstruction and the economic and social recovery and development of the countries affected . Like Ms. McAskie , we believe that the Peacebuilding Commission is a useful and effective instrument which makes it possible to deepen our engagement with the United Nations system and to continue to work together in a coordinated manner , responding to the needs of affected countries . It should be recalled that more than 16 per cent of the population of the world , a billion people , live – or rather , exist – in extreme poverty and are directly affected by civil war or are at high risk of being so affected in the very near future . The legacy of conflict is well known ; it is a terrible legacy , and that is why over the last decade the World Bank has significantly expanded its conceptual work in the area of the reconstruction of countries affected by conflict . Our research has confirmed that security and development are inherently connected . But we must also work together with all stakeholders , offering the necessary holistic support for peacemaking processes and drawing up genuine long-term development plans that turn into concrete action on the ground . This is why we believe that the work of the Peacebuilding Commission is critical and should yield concrete results in the real world and in the field . The work of the Commission and all of our work will thus be judged not only by our work here in New York , but primarily by the concrete results achieved in the countries concerned . The World Bank has actively supported the work of the Peacebuilding Commission , with the main objective of improving coordination and cooperation of all of the actors involved . The World Bank is committed to cooperating even more closely with the Commission both in New York and in the field , with all of the resources that we can provide , and that have been requested , insofar as possible . We welcome all of the efforts being made by the Commission in order to create a more focused agenda that would lead to specific results for the benefit of the affected countries . Unfortunately , thus far , we have still have not been able to take part directly in all of the Commission's meetings , as originally stipulated in resolution 1645 ( 2005 ) . I would conclude by saying that we are ready to work jointly with all of our partners to ensure that there is international support and the necessary strategic cooperation among all of the parties that are committed to promoting the peacebuilding processes and to achieve sustainable development . The President ( spoke in Russian ) : I thank Mr. Avalle for his statement . I now give the floor to Mr. Reinhard Munzberg , Special Representative of the International Monetary Fund to the United Nations . Mr. Munzberg : Mr. President , we would like to thank you for the opportunity to intervene at this meeting of the Security Council on the Peacebuilding Commission . The Peacebuilding Commission is a very useful forum where all relevant aspects of a country in a post-conflict situation can be addressed in a comprehensive fashion . We are prepared to cooperate actively with that forum . As members know , the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) is already involved in a number of post-conflict cases , including in the two countries that are on the agenda of the country-specific meetings of the Commission . We share the Commission's emphasis on work on concrete country cases and on country ownership of strategies . Our activities and those of the Commission need to be well integrated in those country-owned strategies . The Commission has made good progress , together with the countries concerned , in identifying priority areas that need to be addressed . We have interacted with the Commission in the country meetings and also in the field . Interactive discussions are of particular value . We appreciate the fact that the IMF will be invited to meetings of the Commission , as stated in the resolution establishing the Peacebuilding Commission . In that regard , it would be useful if the issue of attendance at meetings of the Organizational Committee could be clarified . We are satisfied that the Commission will be an advisory body , and , accordingly , we will inform our governing organs of the progress of the Commission's work in order to ensure that their decisions are informed by the Commission's deliberations on the whole spectrum of aspects relevant to a specific case . The President ( spoke in Russian ) : I thank Mr. Munzberg for his statement . I now give the floor to His Excellency Mr. Joseph Ntakirutimana , Permanent Representative of Burundi . Mr. Ntakirutimana ( Burundi ) ( spoke in French ) : It is an honour for me to be able to speak before the members of the Security Council on an important topic , peacebuilding in post-conflict countries . This subject is today of concern to the various stakeholders determined to offer space for stability , development and hope to countries shattered by conflicts . On behalf of my delegation and on my own account , I would like to thank you , Mr. President , for having invited Burundi to this debate . I would also like to express my gratitude , and that of the people of Burundi , to all the members of the Peacebuilding Commission for the extensive support and encouragement they provided during the country-specific meetings where Burundi was on the Commission's agenda . Similarly , I would also like to express appreciation for the efforts of the Peacebuilding Support Office , which , in a new and difficult context , is trying to make the Commission a success . In July 2006 , the delegation of Burundi was able to offer to the members of the Peacebuilding Commission a comprehensive view of the situation in Burundi . Commission members were able to become familiar with the desolation and poverty through which my country is struggling after more than 10 years of civil war . During the country-specific meeting on Burundi last October , the delegation of Burundi offered a detailed picture of the effects of war in several areas of national life . The members of the Commission were able to see for themselves the immense needs facing the Government of Burundi . Our delegation was also able to stress the many efforts being made by the Government in order to help Burundi emerge from an economic , political and social situation that is significantly impacted by the adverse consequences of conflict . Those efforts were also noted and welcomed by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund , which have been tracking the evolution of the Burundian economy and which were also invited to the same meeting . Following the October meeting , the delegation of Burundi returned home with the task of preparing a presentation for the country-specific meeting on Burundi that was planned for December 2006 . The Government of Burundi had to establish a list of urgent priorities , formulate the technical specifications of those priorities , and so on . My Government immediately set up a national peacebuilding commission , which has worked day and night , untiringly , in synergy with the United Nations Operation in Burundi ( ONUB ) , the diplomats on the ground and civil society . Following that country-specific meeting on Burundi on 12 December 2006 , the Peacebuilding Support Office pledged to the Burundian delegation a package designed to finance the projects presented at that meeting . We are extremely grateful for that . Once again , I would like to thank all of the countries that have already contributed to the Peacebuilding Fund . By doing so , they have made it possible for the new Commission to be operational and to get down to brass tacks . While welcoming the work that has already been done by the Commission , my delegation would like to make the following observations . First of all , seven months after its creation , the Commission should finally become operational and deal with the implementation of projects that were selected in December 2006 . Secondly , my delegation would like to understand the mechanism or mechanisms for disbursing the allocated funds and would especially hope that these mechanisms might be made more flexible . Thirdly , my country is organizing a donor round table in March 2007 , for which I would like to request the support of the Commission at three levels . First , we would like to see members of the Commission attend the donor round table , which we plan to hold on 14 March 2007 . Secondly , we would like the Peacebuilding Commission to provide ongoing support to the Burundian Government so as to galvanize donors , ensuring the success of the round table . Thirdly , given the fact that most of the donors are members of the Peacebuilding Commission , we urge each member to be present at the March meeting and possibly to announce a contribution . The President ( spoke in Russian ) : I thank Mr. Ntakirutimana for his statement . I now give the floor to His Excellency Mr. Sylvester Ekundayo Rowe , Deputy Permanent Representative of Sierra Leone . Mr. Rowe ( Sierra Leone ) : It is an honour for Sierra Leone to have been selected as one of the first two countries to be placed on the agenda of the Peacebuilding Commission . It is also an honour for my delegation to speak as a country-specific participant at this meeting of the Security Council . We are grateful to the United Nations and the international community for their continued engagement with the situation in Sierra Leone following the devastating rebel war . That engagement has been demonstrated in many practical ways . For instance , following the successful peacekeeping operation – the United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone – the Organization established its first Integrated Office in Sierra Leone . The Office – now in its second year – is , indeed , an experiment , and hopefully it will become a model of United Nations post-peacekeeping . It has set the pace for a similar mechanism in Burundi . It will also be recalled that a few years ago Sierra Leone became the subject of another experiment : an experiment in transitional justice , in the form of a hybrid Special Court , based on national and international criminal law , to try individuals accused of war crimes and crimes against humanity . Incidentally , as we all know , that experiment has been working well but is facing funding problems . The Special Court can not become a model without the financial resources necessary to conclude its work within the established time frame . Now Sierra Leone finds itself the subject of yet another experiment in post-conflict cooperation , namely , as a specific country under consideration by the new Peacebuilding Commission . We are occupying an enviable position . My delegation would like to assure the Security Council that Sierra Leone will make good use of its position in this worthy experiment . We are committed to the integrated approach to peacebuilding that the United Nations has adopted in post-conflict peacebuilding leading to sustainable development . Sierra Leone had great expectations regarding the Commission . We saw it – and still see it – as a supplementary but effective instrument for facilitating the process of early post-conflict recovery . We have faith in its commitment to help us to address some of the problems and challenges that require urgent attention , and our expectations remain high . As others have pointed out , the Peacebuilding Commission is new . It is still going through the proverbial teething stage . Perhaps one could say that it is even too early to make a definitive and objective evaluation of its substantive work . However , in the view of my delegation , the results of the recent country-specific meetings augur well for the future success of the Commission . For Sierra Leone , a highlight of those meetings was the conclusion that an envelope of approximately $ 25 million was expected to be made available as an initial – I stress : initial – contribution towards the implementation of our priority programmes . It is in this regard that my delegation would like to emphasize that any assessment of the work of the Peacebuilding Commission must be based on its objectives and mandate as outlined in the relevant resolutions of the Security Council and the General Assembly . First of all , we should always bear in mind that the Commission is a special mechanism created to address the special needs of a special group or category of countries . Accordingly , the process of meeting those special needs may require some elements of creativity , flexibility and adaptability . Secondly , the mandate of the Peacebuilding Commission reflects a sense of urgency – we are in a hurry . If , indeed , the Commission is to help ensure that countries emerging from conflict do not relapse into conflict , and if provision has been made for the Commission to deal with any situation where a country is at risk of or already relapsing into armed conflict , it follows that the Commission and the international community must act speedily to avert imminent crisis . As far as achieving the objectives of the Peacebuilding Commission is concerned , the bottom line is "" resources , resources , resources "" . Indeed , throughout the mandate of the Commission , the key words are "" assistance "" and "" resources "" – and we can look at the mandate and objectives again . Of course , the Commission was created to provide advice and propose integrated strategies for post-conflict recovery . Of course , its job – or part of its job – is to mobilize sustained international attention on the needs of our countries , even beyond the period of post-conflict recovery . However , we should bear in mind – and I would like to emphasize this – that the Commission is expected to assist our countries in laying the foundation for sustainable development , to mobilize assistance and , I stress , to bring together all relevant actors to marshal resources and help ensure predictable financing for early recovery activities . This brings me to the issue of delivery , which is very close to our heart . My delegation believes that the most effective way that the international community can continue to demonstrate its continued engagement with Sierra Leone and other least developed countries emerging from conflict is through the timely delivery of the necessary assistance to meet the special needs of the countries concerned . My delegation notes with satisfaction that the most recent country-specific meeting of the Commission stressed that every effort should be made to deliver the Peacebuilding Fund country assistance envelope for Sierra Leone in January 2007 so that implementation of the agreed short-term priorities can commence immediately . The Sierra Leone delegation is aware that the processes of mobilizing and marshalling resources are complex . They obviously require extensive coordination and consultations at various levels – at the national level and at the international level . However , timely delivery of assistance is crucial to the success of the whole recovery process . We are encouraged by the commitment of the Peacebuilding Commission and the international community , especially those countries that have made generous contributions to the Peacebuilding Fund . We applaud them . We want just to take this opportunity today to make an appeal , in the form of a reminder that before the ruthless rebel war , Sierra Leone was one of the least developed countries of the world . The conflict made an already precarious situation even worse . While we share many or most of the problems that other post-conflict countries face , we should realize that Sierra Leone is , in a sense , unique . It should be treated according to its own particular circumstances . My delegation is confident that within the next few days the Secretary-General will announce the allocation of an appreciable amount from the Peacebuilding Fund that is commensurate with the special needs and critical priorities that we outlined in the Peacebuilding Commission last year . The President ( spoke in Russian ) : I thank Mr. Rowe for his statement . Mr. Arias ( Panama ) ( spoke in Spanish ) : The delegation of Panama believes that this is an opportune moment to recall that heads of State or Government , meeting during the 2005 World Summit , acknowledged the need for the Organization to carry out a coordinated , consistent and integrated peacebuilding and reconciliation effort in countries that have emerged from conflict . To meet that need , they established the Peacebuilding Commission with the participation of the General Assembly , the Security Council and the Economic and Social Council . That is why Panama believes it is appropriate that both the General Assembly and the Security Council have decided to conduct an initial review of how , in terms of form and substance , the Commission is carrying out the task entrusted to it . After all , the maintenance of international peace and security is a task entrusted to both the Assembly and the Council by the Charter itself . The mission of Panama believes that that task must be carried out in a coherent , coordinated and comprehensive manner . The objective of this consultation process should be an initial assessment of the Commission's working mechanisms and decision-making processes so that all of these organs , each within its own perspective , can have the information and knowledge they need in order to provide the Commission , if necessary , with timely assistance or advice so that it can carry out the task entrusted to it by the heads of State and Government . We acknowledge that the Peacebuilding Commission is still in the process of finding its own identity . However , we applaud the efforts of the Organizational Committee and the Peacebuilding Support Office in preparing for meetings on specific cases , assessing the progress on those cases and drawing up a plan based on the requests of the Governments of Sierra Leone and Burundi . We expect and are resolved that the Peacebuilding Commission will distinguish itself through effective and efficient performance . To that end , each and every one of us who are involved must maintain a firm commitment to act with the promptness and transparency that this responsibility requires . The Commission's function must be to coordinate the available resources in a comprehensive , rigorous and coherent manner in order to make it easier for the countries under its auspices to have the programmes , institutions and capacities that will enable them to take the necessary measures to achieve economically sustainable and socially responsible development . Mr. Voto-Bernales ( Peru ) ( spoke in Spanish ) : My delegation welcomes the fact that the Security Council is today considering the role of the Peacebuilding Commission . We highlight the participation in this debate by the President of the Economic and Social Council , the Chairman of the Organizational Committee of the Peacebuilding Commission and the delegations in charge of following up on the cases of Sierra Leone and Burundi , as well as representatives of the major international financial institutions , whose statements will enrich this debate . The Peacebuilding Commission is one of the outcomes of the 25 Summit , which reaffirmed our confidence in multilateralism as a way to face the new challenges arising in the transition from the maintenance of international peace and security to stability and development . If it is to carry out that mandate , this new organ must be as useful and effective as possible . That is undoubtedly the spirit that , we are sure , we all share as we take part in this debate . Peru supports the efforts to sustain the peacemaking and reconstruction processes in countries emerging from violent armed conflict , and it participates in peacekeeping operations dealing with such cases . We are aware that recent history has demonstrated that the premature withdrawal of peace operations puts countries back into a situation of crisis and violence , which no one wants ; that conflicts seemingly overcome have re-emerged ; and that the populations involved lose faith in the effectiveness of these peacemaking processes . Prolonged conflicts create a perverse dynamic of force and destruction as permanent instruments of power and even of survival . To counteract that , we must reconstruct the social fabric , establish a culture of peace and convey the notion that the best security and the most benefits are to be found in peace , thus enhancing its social value . That requires a comprehensive approach that includes the military and police component that restores the security environment ; the rebuilding of public institutions , the rule of law and the promotion of human rights ; and attention to the structural economic and social elements , the poverty , marginalization and exclusion that are at the root of many of these conflicts . A fundamental component of peacebuilding is development . There will always be a greater risk of relapse into conflict to the extent that people feel vulnerable and see no improvement in their situation . We must lay the foundations for development in the form of institution-building , justice and respect for human rights , but also in the provision of services such as health , education , security and opportunities for economic inclusion . In order to build a viable and sustainable peace process , it is essential that the local actors in these conflicts be committed to that process and carry it out responsibly . That element must underlie peacebuilding initiatives and is ultimately the only guarantee that armed violence will not destroy the progress that has been made . In that connection , inclusive processes are necessary to create links of interdependence and mutual commitments and obligations among the parties involved . Thus , through the path of participation , we create common spaces for aspirations and objectives , and national identity and a feeling of belonging are affirmed . That is why reconstruction programmes must not repeat the events that made the States fail in the first place . We must build democratic societies with viable economies – that is , States that emerge from disorder and backwardness and take charge of their own destiny . These processes must be adapted to each specific situation , in which the Peacebuilding Commission must promote the development of national capacities and institutions capable of developing organic plans and projects that provide continuity and consistency to the national effort and attract international cooperation . It is important to appropriately define areas of work and , when possible , to establish suitable indicators that let us know about progress in the management capacity of a country emerging from conflict . Likewise , such indicators will make it possible to assess progress and the relevance of the recommendations and assistance of the Peacebuilding Commission . We also believe that the Commission must help to improve the coordination between the United Nations and the system's agencies so that there will be appropriate leadership on the ground and a clear mandate for the tasks of peacebuilding . Moreover , reconstruction is a process that must arouse the interest of national and international private enterprise . That is why we need to formulate programmes capable of attracting such business participation . It also means that we must redouble our efforts to strengthen State institutions so as to ensure that special interests coincide with the general interest , that reconstruction programmes are transparent and that the resources generated – including those derived from the exploitation of natural resources – have increased benefits among the population . This should also be a requirement in programmes of the international financial institutions . Let me conclude by noting that we are closely following the way in which the cases of Sierra Leone and Burundi are currently being addressed by the Peacebuilding Commission . Without doubt , it is a challenge to all of us to enable those countries are able to make a successful transition to stability and development . Mr. Lacroix ( France ) ( spoke in French ) : My delegation wishes at the outset to thank the Russian Federation for its initiative to organize today's debate during its presidency of the Security Council . I wish also to welcome the President of the Economic and Social Council , the Chairman of the Organizational Committee of the Peacebuilding Commission and Ms. Carolyn McAskie , and to thank them , and the other previous speakers , for their statements . Those statements clearly indicated everything that is at stake in ensuring that the Peacebuilding Commission is successful in its mission and outlined the all challenges that it must meet to achieve that success . In our view , it is vital that flexible and effective interaction between the Commission and the Security Council be developed in practice ; we hope that the Council will regularly consider the work of the Peacebuilding Commission . We hope too that the General Assembly and the Economic and Social Council will devote particular attention to the new body's work , as provided for in the resolutions that established the Commission . While we fully endorse the statement that will be made by the presidency of the European Union , I wish to speak of some particular aspects of the work of the Peacebuilding Commission . The Peacebuilding Commission's added value derives from its capacity to deal in a concentrated manner with problems that are specific to peacebuilding processes , by tackling the most urgent challenges . The participation in the Commission's work of all relevant actors on the ground , in particular States of the region and institutional and bilateral donors , is fundamental in that regard . Here , my delegation fully supports participation in the meetings of the Peacebuilding Commission by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund , as their representatives have proposed today . Most often , issues of institution-building – related to such areas as the rule of law , good governance and security-sector reform – are key post-conflict priorities . In many cases , those areas fall outside the realm of intervention and the capacity of development actors . By their very nature , they require close coordination of activities undertaken on the ground . I am thinking in particular of disarmament , demobilization and reintegration processes , which lie at the intersection of peacekeeping and development concerns . By making it possible to identify goals and priorities shared by all actors and to coordinate their activities in accordance with a timetable for intervention that is robust but adapted to immediate priorities , the Peacebuilding Commission can become an essential instrument for setting countries emerging from crisis firmly on the path to peace and sustainable development . The first country-specific meetings , on Burundi and Sierra Leone , have made it possible to start identifying areas that are critical for the peacebuilding processes in those countries on the basis of analyses carried out by their national authorities . That is at the core of the work of the Peacebuilding Commission , and it must continue with a view to precisely identifying priority actions and measures to be undertaken in areas seen as crucial to the peacebuilding process . At the end of the process , all actors in the field , first and foremost the authorities of the countries concerned , should have a road map that can form the basis for an appropriate and lasting commitment by the international community . In that spirit , we consider that the Commission should focus its efforts at this stage on preparations for country-specific meetings concerning the countries on its agenda . The Peacebuilding Support Office , which is now operational , has a critical role to play here . We consider that speedy and appropriate distribution to Commission members of information relating to the countries concerned is essential . An inventory of actions undertaken in each of the areas critical for the peacebuilding process has already been carried out . It should now be the basis for identifying gaps and improving coordination among all peacebuilding actors in the two countries . In addition to projects financed by the Peacebuilding Fund , the Commission's work should lead to better allocation of resources and enhanced involvement by all actors , starting with the authorities of the countries concerned . Those authorities should , of course , be closely involved in the preparation and implementation of the work of the Commission . Here , I want to pay tribute to the endeavours carried out by the authorities of Burundi and of Sierra Leone in liaison with the United Nations and other actors . My delegation wishes in conclusion to reaffirm the importance it attaches to the goal of being able collectively and in the very near future to achieve tangible results for the countries being considered by the Commission . I wish also to stress that at the appropriate time the Security Council should fully integrate those results into its work . The Council ought to be able to share in the added value that the Peacebuilding Commission should bring to our collective effort to promote peace and security . Mr. Verbeke ( Belgium ) ( spoke in French ) : I wish at the outset to thank you , Mr. President , for your initiative in organizing a debate on the work of the Peacebuilding Commission . My comments supplement those that our colleague , the representative of Germany , will make on behalf of the presidency of the European Union , with which my delegation aligns itself . Belgium has been closely involved in the initial work of the Peacebuilding Commission because we believe in the Commission and will continue to do so . I shall limit my statement to a few brief comments . It should be recalled that the Peacebuilding Commission is multidimensional in nature . It stands at the intersection of questions relating to such concepts as security , good governance , justice , the rule of law , reconstruction and development . That is because it has two parents : the Security Council and the General Assembly . Its multidimensional nature is reflected in the Commission's primary task : to make use of the various existing reconstruction and development plans and strategies to promote the use of an integrated approach taking account of the specific needs of fragile States and the potential threats to peace and stability . The goal is not a package of limited , short-term measures , but comprehensive medium-term and long-term support enabling us to provide guidance to all bilateral and multilateral actors both within the United Nations system and outside it – as well , of course , as in the country itself . But such an integrated approach must not exist only in the abstract : it must specifically and concretely identify the risks , priorities , shortcomings and weaknesses that require specific attention . It is essentially the quality and credibility of this approach that will convince donors to support it by working together and by being actively involved , including in financial terms . The Commission , the Peacebuilding Support Office and the Peacebuilding Fund should not be substitutes for current donors but should inform them and guide them , as appropriate , in order to supplement their action . Here , of course , it is vital that all players , beginning with the country concerned , and including civil society and the private sector , be fully involved in the design of these strategies . I would like to conclude with some more practical considerations . The work of the Peacebuilding Commission takes place , first and foremost , in the country-specific meetings , which could benefit from informal discussions on specific aspects of the action to be taken in a given country with regard to peacebuilding . More sustained work could also be enhanced by relevant documents produced by various players , but above all by the Peacebuilding Support Office . We too , as the Security Council , can support the work of the Peacebuilding Commission by creating more regular and more systematic interaction with the Commission – for example , through briefings to the Council by the Chairs of the country-specific meetings . Beyond the request for general comments , we could ask the Peacebuilding Commission for guidelines on specific peacebuilding issues , and we could do so in a timely way , so that the Commission's views could be usefully integrated into our own work . Mr. Spatafora ( Italy ) : I think the timeliness of this debate is reflected in the food for thought it is generating . At the outset , I would like to express deep appreciation and support for what Ambassador Gaspar Martins , Chairman of the Organizational Committee of the Peacebuilding Commission , said earlier in this meeting , and to draw the attention of Council members to it . Let me quote him briefly . He said , "" Let us all agree that our theoretical differences in New York are meaningless to those who are directly suffering from the consequences of conflict on the ground . What matters for them are concrete actions ... "" ( Supra ) . I think that this is a benchmark that must remain clear in our minds . What we do has an effect on the ground . In general terms , I think we have to express the strongest support for the Chairman of the Organizational Committee . If he does not feel that he has the House behind him , he will not be able to be effective . As our colleague the representative of Sierra Leone has said , we will need creativity , flexibility and adaptability . When it comes to the Commission , it will be mainly the responsibility of the Chair to inspire flexibility and creativity . But he will not be able to be creative if he does not feel that the House is behind him . That was the first point I wanted to make . Secondly , I fully endorse the statement that my colleague , the representative of Germany , will deliver later on behalf of the European Union . I want to stress the importance of the points that he will make . Because of time constraints I will not repeat his words , except to quote briefly from what he will say , according to his advance text : "" If the Commission is to add value to peacebuilding efforts worldwide ... it will have to be ambitious . It will have to be more than the tools we already have : more than a mere coordination mechanism and more than a donors conference . Promoting the development of a viable peacebuilding strategy is where the Peacebuilding Commission can really create added value . "" Here , we should bear in mind what Assistant Secretary-General McAskie said on this matter . I will now limit myself to a few additional remarks . I think that , in shaping and implementing our strategies , we will need , first , to focus strongly on institution-building , as mentioned in operative paragraph 2 ( b ) of Council resolution 1645 ( 2005 ) and General Assembly resolution 60 / 180 , in line with the inspiration of the Peacebuilding Commission : to strengthen the sovereignty of post-conflict States by increasing the effectiveness and credibility of national policies and institutions , with particular reference to the rule of law . As my Belgian colleague said , this will increase the attractiveness of such States to private foreign investors . Secondly , we will need to include a clear sequencing of actions and clear indications to all stakeholders , including donors , of what needs to be done . Thirdly , the strategy should be based on a broad sense of ownership . National responsibility should be at the centre of the peacebuilding process . Institutional donors and relevant regional organizations should be fully on board , through regular consultations both in New York and at the country level . I hope involvement , like that we have seen today , by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) will be structured and will continue in the future . Fourthly , the involvement of civil society , including the national and international private sectors , should be deepened and widened . I will not elaborate further here . Finally , the Peacebuilding Commission should also elaborate a system of benchmarks to monitor progress in implementation . We need monitoring , but monitoring is not just making reports after a certain number of months on what has been done . We are submerged in reports . What is needed is proactive monitoring along the way . It should not point out who is doing well or who is doing badly , but it should just point out where we stand week after week and what has to be done . We know what proactive monitoring is . This is an aspect that has to be injected into the work of the Peacebuilding Commission and into that of the parent bodies of the Commission : the General Assembly and the Security Council . Of course , we should start developing objective criteria for phasing out the involvement of the Peacebuilding Commission in countries that are under consideration and that are successful . We should also start thinking – as we are , in fact , doing – about possible new entries on the Commission's agenda . On a final note , we believe that the Security Council should work together with the Peacebuilding Commission with a view to designing conflict-sensitive peacekeeping and peacebuilding strategies . When I say "" work together "" , I mean not only having a meeting like today 's from time to time , but rather having more interactive meetings where we can see a ways and means process , together with the General Assembly . As we are all aware , and as has to be clear in our minds , the issue is not only how the Commission can assist or advise the Council ; it is also how the Council can provide the Peacebuilding Commission with operational input . We , therefore , believe that the Security Council should , for example , request the advice of the Commission when renewing the mandates of existing peacekeeping missions or when establishing new ones , with a view to developing integrated mission planning processes . The renewal of the peacekeeping mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo , for example , could present the first opportunity for an early peacebuilding planning process . Then , it would act on the advice of the Commission by supporting the crucial functions of the United Nations Integrated Office in Sierra Leone and the United Nations Operation in Burundi on the ground , with a clear mandate and ad hoc expertise . In particular , the role of the United Nations Integrated Offices in facilitating coordination and consultation among all stakeholders , including donors , should be strengthened , as has been mentioned by some of my colleagues . Finally , the promptness of the Commission's responses to Security Council requests for advice should be promoted . We need timely advice . The Department of Peacekeeping Operations , the Department of Political Affairs and the Peacebuilding Support Office should pool their resources and coordinate their efforts in support of the Commission – and I am very grateful to Assistant Secretary-General McAskie for her earlier statement in that regard – in order to ensure smooth and efficient interaction between the two bodies and , of course , between the Peacebuilding Commission and the General Assembly . Mr. Al-Bader ( Qatar ) ( spoke in Arabic ) : We thank you , Sir , for convening this open debate , the first of its kind in the Council since the Peacebuilding Commission started its work . It gives us a timely opportunity to review the Commission's activities and the best ways to support it . I also wish to commend and thank Ambassador Ismael Gaspar Martins , Chairman of the Organizational Committee of the Peacebuilding Commission , and Assistant Secretary-General Carolyn McAskie of the Peacebuilding Support Office for their efforts in a new field . We wish them every success in their work . The establishment of the peacebuilding mechanism composed of the Peacebuilding Commission , the Peacebuilding Support Office and the Peacebuilding Fund is among the most practical and tangible steps taken by the international community to date in the context of operationalizing the indisputable concept that the dedication of resources necessary to peacebuilding in countries emerging from conflict is critical to the consolidation of stability , peace and development . Similarly , the assistance received by those countries from the international community plays a pivotal role in safeguarding against their relapse into conflict . The Commission is still an infant entity and struggling to identify the best ways and means to achieve the objectives for which it was established . Since its inception , it has received encouraging and positive responses from the two countries on its agenda , Burundi and Sierra Leone , where national and international efforts have succeeded in ending their respective conflicts . The success of the peacebuilding phase there will no doubt consolidate those positive results . Given that the Security Council is the primary organ responsible for the maintenance of international peace and security , the success of the peacebuilding process in Burundi and Sierra Leone will be a valuable complement to the efforts of the Council , which is engaged in ongoing follow-up on the situations there . Peacebuilding is an integrated process and a multidimensional endeavour undertaken by various United Nations entities , and can not be broken down into its component tasks . In recognition of that vision , it was decided at the 2005 Summit to establish the Peacebuilding Commission as a consultative organ , under two resolutions of the General Assembly and the Security Council , respectively . Thus , the Commission must work within the mandate given to it by the General Assembly and the Security Council . If the Commission is to meet its objectives , there must be close coordination between it and the Peacebuilding Support Office and the other principal bodies of the United Nations , including the General Assembly , the Security Council and the Economic and Social Council . Peacebuilding activities embody one aspect of such coordination aimed at fulfilling the vision set out in the Organization's Charter . Moreover , the Commission's mandate encourages consultation with civil society , non-governmental organizations and the private sector in order to ensure that it receive the input of international organizations in its peacebuilding activities . There is no doubt that several other countries are appropriate candidates for inclusion on the Commission's agenda . In every case , we must take the fundamental principles of peacebuilding into consideration by acknowledging the unique specificity of each country and hence the different methods by which peacebuilding operations should be conducted . It is important that the Commission and countries emerging from conflict agree on the methodology for undertaking peacebuilding activities if the desired objectives are to be reached . As we have noted , the Peacebuilding Commission is an advisory body seeking to assist countries emerging from conflict in identifying the optimal approach to conducting the peacebuilding process . Its mandate also includes the mobilization of necessary international resources to attain its goals . Consequently , the Peacebuilding Fund and the Commission together constitute an integrated mechanism . We therefore appeal to the international community to donate generously and to mobilize the resources necessary to maintaining the process of peacebuilding and reconstruction . Mr. Gayama ( Congo ) ( spoke in French ) : The delegation of the Congo thanks you , Sir , for allowing the Council today to make an initial assessment of the work of the Peacebuilding Commission , which held its first meeting on 23 June 2006 . We welcome the participation in this important debate of the President of the Economic and Social Council , the Chairman of the Organizational Committee of the Peacebuilding Commission , and representatives of the World Bank , the International Monetary Fund , bilateral partners of the Commission and , of course , the Peacebuilding Support Office , headed by Ms. Carolyn McAskie . The creation of the Peacebuilding Commission was a major step taken as a result of a joint effort and as the expression of a desire clearly identified by world leaders at the 2005 World Summit , in accordance with the purposes and principles of our Organization . When we recall that the official launch of the Peacebuilding Fund took place as recently as 11 October 2006 , we must note along with many others who have spoken here today that the Peacebuilding Commission is just a little child that has not yet reached adolescence . If a useful assessment is to be made at this stage , it should focus on the level of attention and assistance that the Commission enjoys from those who created it , rather than on the Commission itself , which is still seeking to define itself . This debate is timely nonetheless . It allows us to consider potential interaction and synergies between the various partners and stakeholders in this common undertaking . Such a collective and constructive commitment should be made on the basis of adherence to a few simple rules , including respect for the Commission's mission , as established under resolution 1645 ( 2005 ) ; appropriate distribution of work among the partners involved in order to avoid duplication ; and open and transparent debate within the Commission in order to promote concerted action to mobilize all local , regional and international actors . Of course , such a comprehensive approach to addressing issues should take into account the elements associated with integrated strategies for peacebuilding and the re-establishment of peace . But it should also take into account those related to conflict prevention . In order to gain full credibility , the Peacebuilding Commission must not give the appearance of being just another body cut off from reality . The Commission has the advantage that its main area of operations is in the field , where it is called upon to be a catalyst that can mobilize all the necessary elements to ensure the success of its mandate . Two countries are currently on the agenda of the Peacebuilding Commission : Burundi and Sierra Leone . Country-specific meetings devoted to those countries began on 13 October 2006 . In that regard , concerns arose in connection with the mobilization of financial resources – a matter that has now become a central issue . Moreover , it is clear that there continue to be social and political obstacles , which pose real threats to stability in those two countries . The high level of youth unemployment and the critical state of social infrastructure in both Burundi and Sierra Leone can lead to popular unrest , which could give rise to unforeseen problems . In addition , the security services do not yet have the necessary means to ensure public order . However , in order to build peace it is clear that we will need to enhance the capacities of those countries , especially their economic and social capacities . We must also help them improve the administration of public resources , combat corruption , ensure respect for human rights , promote good governance and the rule of law and launch and nurture national dialogue . Economic progress and improved living conditions for the people concerned are therefore essential to the stability we seek . The 2005 World Summit Outcome ( General Assembly resolution 60 / 1 ) correctly recalled that development , peace and security and human rights are interlinked and mutually reinforcing . Thus , a situation that may appear to be back to normal can always conceal threats that can emerge if we ignore certain unforeseen elements . The experience in Timor-Leste has been a good lesson for us all in that regard . It is clear from its first experiences in Burundi and Sierra Leone that the Peacebuilding Commission needs sustained support from the international community . To that end , we will have to put in place strategic options adapted to each situation . Of course , the areas for intervention must be identified in partnership with the Governments concerned and with civil society , while at the same time endeavouring to establish a hierarchy of priorities . Experience in these first cases should provide a basis for improving the Commission's intervention mechanisms . Success in those cases will make it possible for us more clearly to consider future cases , such as Timor-Leste , Haiti the Democratic Republic of the Congo and others . We should not lose sight of the fact that , to be reliably successful , all peacebuilding efforts should have the support of the relevant national authorities , provided progressively beginning at a specific stage of the undertaking . The Peacebuilding Fund is certainly not a development fund as such , but it should be able to assist us in finding solutions to various urgent problems in a holistic way . It is therefore important to ensure that the Fund has predictable resources . The appeal made by the Secretary-General at the launching of the Fund – in which he emphasized the vital importance of donor support , without which the objectives of the Peacebuilding Commission will not be achieved – should be repeated today , and that is what we are doing . The new Commission will of course not replace existing bodies . The principle of complementarity is at the very heart of the interaction between the various bodies of the United Nations system . In order to benefit from that , however , the Security Council , the General Assembly and the Economic and Social Council should all continue to adapt to ensure that they too achieve a level of effectiveness that meets both their Charter objectives and general expectations . In other words , to use the metaphor of parent and child , the existence of the Peacebuilding Commission should ease the conscience of those who established it , just as parents pass on to their children the dreams and ambitions that they themselves could not realize . The Commission would otherwise be just another body in an insufficiently reformed international institutional framework . Of course , that is not what we want . We believe that the establishment of the Peacebuilding Commission is a promising beginning as regards the reform of the entire United Nations system . In conclusion , we therefore appeal for enhanced coordinated efforts to ensure the continued growth of the Peacebuilding Commission in the spirit of coherence so badly needed by the United Nations system today . Mr. Burian ( Slovakia ) : Slovakia fully aligns itself with the statement that will be delivered shortly by the Permanent Representative of Germany on behalf of the European Union . I shall therefore limit my statement to a few additional comments . At the outset , Mr. President , I wish to commend your initiative to convene this open debate on the work of the Peacebuilding Commission . In our view , this is an important and timely opportunity to explore ways and mechanisms for interaction between the Council and the Peacebuilding Commission in order to strengthen the synergy of efforts aimed at helping post-conflict countries to manage the difficult transition from war to peace . We believe that the Peacebuilding Commission could benefit from more structured interaction with the relevant principal organs of the United Nations . In addition , the Council could benefit from a proactive approach and the advice of the Peacebuilding Commission in dealing with specific post-conflict situations . The Peacebuilding Commission was established to bridge a critical gap in the peacebuilding architecture . In that respect , the first results of the work of the Peacebuilding Commission demonstrate that the decision to create that new United Nations body was a step in the right direction . At the same time , we must continue to seek its proper place in the system of United Nations institutions , so as to avoid unnecessary duplication of effort and to efficiently utilize its unique capabilities and comparative advantages . The Peacebuilding Commission should continue to develop its mechanisms to better serve as a forum for coordination and exchange of views among major stakeholders , donors and countries with experience in peacebuilding , with a view to defining integrated and tailored country-specific post-conflict strategies . In that regard , we share the belief that , as the Permanent Representative of Italy rightly pointed out , the best added value will come not from formal reports or decisions , but rather from operational outcomes envisaged in the interaction stimulated by Peacebuilding Commission meetings in the field that bring together all stakeholders and donors . That will be more helpful , in our view , than trying to reach negotiated agreements on formal decisions and reports . The measure of its success should be gauged by fewer numbers of countries relapsing from fragile peace to conflict , and not by a greater number of reports and more paperwork . In our view , the work of the Peacebuilding Commission will be most effective in the country-specific mode in the field , where its work should be focused . We also believe that the Peacebuilding Commission should be oriented towards seeking practical solutions to complex problems in the area of post-conflict peace consolidation . In that respect , we support the idea of establishing working groups to comprehensively discuss some of the specific aspects of peacebuilding in country-specific meetings , such as the rule of law and other crucial elements of peace consolidation processes . These working groups could bring together different parts of the United Nations that have been involved in the peacebuilding process , major stakeholders and donors . During its presidency of the Security Council in February , Slovakia will organize an open debate on one important aspect of peacebuilding , and that is security-sector reform . We believe that a more coherent and systematic approach by the international community is needed to address this issue and to secure the proper functioning of security forces and institutions in a post-conflict country . We believe the Commission might play a crucial role in this regard in helping countries to address this problem in a comprehensive manner and could generate long-term support and resources to ensure the coherence and sustainability of the process over the long term . Last but not least , we believe that in the future the Security Council should make better use of the Peacebuilding Commission as a source of advice on peacebuilding strategies and mandates . Finally , we believe that the number of situations on the Commission's agenda could be gradually expanded to include such countries as Haiti , Timor-Leste or the Democratic Republic of the Congo . An important prerequisite for this would be proper definition of the Commission's role and mechanisms to manage an increased number of highly complex situations . Here again , we want to underline the importance of country-specific mechanisms in the field as a way to meet this goal . Based on the concrete proposals and observations we have heard this morning , we believe that today's discussion will generate useful ideas that could help to bring new dynamics to the work of the Commission and strengthen the interaction of the Council with the Commission . Mr. Miller ( United States of America ) : Mr. President , I appreciate your initiative in scheduling this open discussion of the Peacebuilding Commission . I will be brief , as I think it is more important that we listen to our guests here today , including the President of the Economic and Social Council , Assistant Secretary-General McAskie , the Chairman of the Organizational Committee of the Peacebuilding Commission and the chairs of the country-specific meetings of that Commission , the representatives of the World Bank , and the International Monetary Fund and particularly the Permanent Representatives of Burundi and Sierra Leone . I suggest that we look at this debate and the discussion on the Peacebuilding Commission to take place soon in the General Assembly as opportunities to re-energize our common effort to better contribute to concrete results on the ground . No one working in post-conflict situations , no citizen of a country trying to emerge from months or years of fighting cares at all about United Nations lines of authority or the institutional breakdown of seats around the conference room table . They care and we should care – about results . What we all agree on is the goal of strengthening the Commission's ability to make a real difference in strategies to support countries emerging from conflict , to help these societies establish the institutions and systems necessary to prevent a relapse into violence . From the United States perspective as a member of the Security Council , the goal of the Commission must be to facilitate better coordination between the Council's security component and the broader post-conflict stabilization efforts of the international community . The Commission should provide a forum for the various agencies , Governments and organizations involved in a particular post-conflict situation to come together and share their assessments and work plans and to better coordinate and target their respective efforts , and for the Council to benefit from their common advice and best recommendations . The strength of the Peacebuilding Commission will be found through pragmatic , action-oriented and country-specific recommendations to address the problems of post-conflict peacebuilding . The problems encountered by countries emerging from conflict are not solely – and for some , not even mainly – a lack of resources . In any event , this is something for which the Commission will not be able to compensate . Rather , the problems have rather to do with how to ensure that the activities of the national Government and outside partners are well coordinated , that the significant funds available through existing donor mechanisms are best utilized and that the international community's attention to these countries' needs does not fade . We will take this same practical spirit into the discussions that take place in the General Assembly , in the Organizational Committee of the Peacebuilding Commission itself and , most importantly , in the Commission's country-specific meetings . We hope others do too . We appreciate the opportunity today to hear the views of others , both inside this Council and out , on how we can help the Commission better serve our common goal . Ms. Pierce ( United Kingdom ) : May I join others in congratulating you , Mr. President , for holding this debate and for giving us the opportunity to hear so many valuable contributions in the Chamber today . It is now seven months since the Peacebuilding Commission was established , and it is appropriate that we in its parent body take stock . In this vein , we , along with others , very much look forward to the debate in the General Assembly next week . We are optimistic about the value the Commission can add . It is a new body and is still feeling its way , but we believe the Commission membership is committed to practical steps to improve peacebuilding across key aspects of the work of the United Nations . The Commission was created , as many speakers have noted , because there was in a gap in the market . Countries emerging from conflict had no natural home at the United Nations , and several slipped back into conflict when international scrutiny was diverted elsewhere . This has cost too many lives . So the Commission ensures that countries emerging from conflict remain on our agenda – the joint agenda of the Security Council , the Economic and Social Council and the General Assembly , that these countries benefit from the respective scrutiny we can provide and that they align countries , troop-contributing countries , donors , international financial institutions and other actors in a coordinated set of priorities across the social , security , economic and rule of law areas . I should like to align myself with the statement to be made soon by Germany on behalf of the European Union and will therefore confine my intervention to concentrating on some core elements of the Commission's work on which we hope we can all focus in the coming months . By the time of the Commission's first anniversary , we should be proud of the positive impact this new body is having on the ground . First , we believe that the core mandate of the Peacebuilding Commission is its country-specific work with strong national leadership . When the Commission reviews a country , there are six fundamental things we believe it should do . First , the Commission should take a comprehensive look at peacebuilding to identify the most pressing priorities and make recommendations covering governance , human rights and aid , as well as peace and security . Second , it should involve a wide range of actors , including civil society and the private sector , to agree upon a common vision of how to build peace and promote exchanges of information , coordination and best practice . Third , it should provide scrutiny and honest assessment of progress and problems . Fourth , it should , through frank dialogue with the Government concerned , provide recommendations for action to be followed up on by the Security Council , the international financial institutions , United Nations agencies and other partners . Fifth , it should ensure follow-up to those recommendations through regular progress reviews . Sixth , it should ensure that lessons learned are compiled and disseminated . The United Kingdom believes that within this framework and with the establishing resolution serving as a foundation , there are three key areas where the Security Council and the Peacebuilding Commission can develop an effective working relationship . I note from the important contributions we have heard today that there seems to be a wide measure of agreement on how this partnership might work . First , the Security Council can use the Peacebuilding Commission for advice . The timing of the request for advice is important – for example , before a mandate renewal , or before the establishment of a new peacekeeping operation . But the nature of the request is also important . The Council could ask for an overview of the situation or advice on a specific issue . Secondly , the Security Council receives the advice and acts on it appropriately . Sometimes the Council might simply take note of the advice . At others , the advice or recommendation for action will need further evaluation and action by the Council . Thirdly , the Commission provides early warning to the Council , for instance , drawing the attention of the Security Council to setbacks and risk factors in countries on the Council's agenda . We see this particular area is one where the Security Council can add value . I am also sure that there is complementarity in the value on the economic and social side that the Economic and Social Council will be able to add . I want to stress that there is no exclusivity here . We look forward to discussion in other bodies of the United Nations . All contributions are equally valid . Finally , I can not mention the development of the Peacebuilding Commission's work without mentioning the Peacebuilding Support Office . I would like to thank the Assistant Secretary-General for all her efforts so far in bringing this office to life . The Support Office has a number of critical roles . It acts as a secretariat to the Commission , it supports the United Nations country teams in their work with the Commission , and it is a repository for relevant lessons learned so that we can all benefit from best practices . We hope that by the time of the Commission's first anniversary it will have an important impact on the ground . That means that the peacebuilding priorities identified by the Commission are being implemented in Sierra Leone and Burundi , it means that the United Nations and international actors are being more joined up in support of these priorities , and it means that by July we would hope that the Peacebuilding Commission has an annual calendar of meetings agreed , that there should be well-established in-country consultation mechanisms with national Governments taking the leading role , and that the Peacebuilding Support Office should be working at full strength . With the help of all the colleagues on the Peacebuilding Commission , we believe that we can reach these goals . Mr. Kumalo ( South Africa ) : We thank the delegation of the Russian Federation for organizing this important meeting on post-conflict peacebuilding . My delegation is pleased that the Security Council extended an invitation to the Chairman of the Organizational Committee of the General Assembly , the President of the Economic and Social Council , the President of the Peacebuilding Commission and other important actors that are participating in this debate today . We also appreciate the fact that the Security Council has opened this meeting to other States Members of the United Nations as a way of demonstrating that peacebuilding is a responsibility for all . Last year , both the General Assembly and the Security Council established the Peacebuilding Commission . Now that the Commission is soon to be a year old , it is time for each organ – the General Assembly and the Security Council – according to its respective mandate , to reflect further on the purpose and mission of the Peacebuilding Commission . At present , my delegation is concerned that the Commission means different things to different people . To quote briefly the ambassador of Angola and Chair of the Organizational Committee of the Peacebuilding Commission , "" Let us all agree that our theoretical differences in New York are meaningless to those who are directly suffering from the consequences of conflict on the ground . What matters for them are concrete actions and not just eloquent statements . "" For example , it is easier to explain that the Peacebuilding Commission is not a donor agency , since it can not have the resources of the United Nations Development Programme , the World Bank or even the International Monetary Fund . Also , the Commission can not simply meet in New York to discuss far-away countries that are struggling to emerge from conflict . What the Peacebuilding Commission is , and should be , is more complicated and difficult to explain . According to the founding resolutions passed by both the Security Council and the General Assembly , the Peacebuilding Commission has three main purposes . The first is to bring together all relevant actors to marshal resources and to advise on and propose integrated strategies for post-conflict peacebuilding and recovery . Its second purpose is to focus attention on the reconstruction and institution-building efforts necessary for recovery from conflict and to support the development of integrated strategies in order to lay the foundation for sustainable development . The third purpose is to provide recommendations and information to improve the coordination of all relevant actors within and without the United Nations , to develop best practices , to help to ensure predictable financing for early recovery activities and to extend the period of attention given by the international community to post-conflict recovery . Certainly , the aims and purposes of the Peacebuilding Commission are phrased in language that is vague . What is clear , however , is that the Commission has to make its impact on the ground , which means that it needs to embrace strategies for post-conflict recovery that enjoy the confidence of the countries concerned . Without country ownership , the Commission is likely to be regarded as a structure that imposes solutions that may be unacceptable to the countries that are supposed to benefit from its expertise and advice . The Peacebuilding Commission has to be knowledgeable about the actors on the ground that are promoting post-conflict recovery , since it is in the best position to enhance coordination and cooperation among various stakeholders . The Commission can bring together the United Nations agencies , the donors , civil society and the Governments in a common purpose of building peace and thereby fill the gap that is always present when various organizations and agencies are trying their best to achieve the same goal from different perspectives and mandates . In this way , the Commission may be able to identify a niche for itself . We welcome the recognition by the Security Council of the link between peace and development , which is reflected in the integrated approach to peacekeeping . In response , the civilian components of peacekeeping operations are structured under a development pillar and a security pillar . Peacekeeping is an integral part of peacebuilding , and therefore it is important that peacekeeping operations create an enabling environment for those involved in peacebuilding efforts , including the promotion of human rights , so that their efforts could be integrated from the point of the deployment of a mission . This integrated manner is already reflected in the Council mandates for recent complex missions such as the United Nations Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo , the United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone , the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti , the United Nations Operation in Côte d ' Ivoire , and others . The Security Council could seek advice from the Peacebuilding Commission before peacekeeping operations are deployed and after the Council has decided on mandates , so as to ensure greater cohesion between the United Nations peacekeeping operations and other actors involved in peacebuilding . Before scaling down the activities of peacekeeping operations in a country emerging from conflict , the Security Council could also consult with the Commission , so that the transition is smooth and everything is in place when the peacekeepers leave . The holding of elections has often been considered as a benchmark for declaring that a country has emerged from conflict and is ready for the next stage of peacebuilding . Yet there have been occasions when the donors , including the Bretton Woods institutions , have needed more assurance beyond the holding of elections , no matter how free and fair those elections may be . I pause here again to quote the President of the Economic and Social Council , who put it much better in his statement by calling this tactic "" a wait-and-see approach "" . While the holding of elections is an important indicator of future stability , it may not indicate that a country emerging from conflict is beyond a relapse to its past . A more comprehensive indicator of stability may be a combination of the holding of democratic elections , disarmament , demobilization and reintegration ( DDR ) , reconstruction and security sector reform . Yet in some countries emerging from conflict , the World Bank and the United Nations Development Programme have been slow in funding or implementing DDR activities because of large unpaid debts owed to them – usually by the previous regime or Government . The Peacebuilding Commission could provide a forum through which problems relating to the slow pace of funding peacebuilding activities could be resolved quickly . The quick injection of resources into a country emerging from conflict is often the glue that keeps that country from falling apart once again . Here , I would like to refer to the statement made earlier by the Representative of Sierra Leone , who said simply that the mandate of the Peacebuilding Commission reflects a sense of urgency . For that reason , we believe that the donor community needs to be flexible and to remain engaged , particularly in the early post-conflict stages . The Peacebuilding Fund was created for the specific purpose of assisting in the facilitation of peacebuilding activities . The Fund was understood to be a catalyst for attracting much-needed resources – particularly at a time when there may be little hope of success towards recovery . It is for that reason that we hope that the role of the Peacebuilding Fund will be clearly defined . It would be unfortunate if , because of the Peacebuilding Fund , the Peacebuilding Commission were to be mistaken for a donor agency . Finally , there are fundamental practices that the Commission should follow if it is to become successful . One of these is ensuring that countries emerging from conflict have full ownership of the building of the peace for the benefit of their people . Another is to make certain that the Peacebuilding Commission develops rules of procedure that are permanent and predictable . It should be clear to everyone what the Commission is about and what it can and can not do . Lastly , the Peacebuilding Commission will soon be requested to consider taking on other countries , beyond Sierra Leone and Burundi . We hope that such requests will be considered in the light of the experience gained in assisting the first two countries on the Commission's agenda . The Peacebuilding Commission is very important for the lives of people in countries that are emerging from conflict . It needs to be a beacon of hope and promise . Its impact must be felt on the ground . In other words , the Commission should soon meet in Freetown or Bujumbura . New York meetings alone are not going to make a great difference in the lives of people in Freetown and Bujumbura , who are supposed to be the beneficiaries of the Peacebuilding Commission . Nana Effah-Apenteng ( Ghana ) : At the outset , I , too , would like to commend the delegation of the Russian Federation for having organized this debate , which affords us the opportunity to highlight the importance and review the performance of the Peacebuilding Commission . In this regard , we are grateful to the various officials and the representatives of Sierra Leone and Burundi for their briefings and statements . I associate myself with the statement to be made later by the representative of Jamaica on behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement . We all clearly have a stake in the Peacebuilding Commission , whose creation is but one important step in the implementation of the institutional reforms needed to enable the United Nations to respond to the needs identified in the 2005 World Summit Outcome for an institutional , systematic and seamless connection between peacekeeping and post-conflict peacebuilding . Only an effective Peacebuilding Commission can ensure that the huge investments made by the international community in peace and stability in those volatile parts of the world will achieve the most positive , sustainable and irreversible outcomes . The success of the Commission will certainly bring encouragement and hope to millions of people – especially those in Africa – caught in the vicious cycle of conflict and poverty . We are very pleased , therefore , that the Organizational Committee held meetings during which Burundi and Sierra Leone were selected as pioneers in post-conflict peacebuilding under the auspices of the Peacebuilding Commission . They deserve all the support they can get in their recovery efforts because , as pilot projects , their success will impact on the future of the Commission . The danger of relapse is all too real and ever-present in societies that are still emerging from conflict . In a climate of high expectations and lurking distrust , the transition from peacekeeping to post-conflict recovery poses enormous institutional challenges that can easily overwhelm any Government . Above all , we must understand that as long as the underlying causes of conflict remain unaddressed , we could be on shaky ground . In our view , therefore , the most important role of the Peacebuilding Commission will be to identify , to prioritize and to target its limited resources with a view to addressing those fundamental problems . In this way , the Commission can be a worthy partner and help national Governments to adopt the best practices in governance that are so critical to long-term reconciliation and stability and ensure a seamless transition from conflict to the promotion of sustainable peace and development . As a member of the Organizational Committee , Ghana recognizes that the Peacebuilding Commission , like any new body or agency , will have teething problems . However , we are of the considered view that we need to agree early on our modus operandi . In this regard , we should avoid creating unnecessary bureaucratic layers and procedures and focus more on the delivery or implementation of agreed national strategies . As has been evident from some of the statements made today – especially the passionate appeal by the representative of Sierra Leone – we should strive to reduce the time lag between approval and disbursement of resources . Previous speakers have rightly highlighted the organic relationship that must exist between the Security Council and the Peacebuilding Commission and , by extension , the other organs of the United Nations , especially the General Assembly and the Economic and Social Council . It can not be otherwise , because of the inextricable link between peace , security and development . Indeed , the Peacebuilding Commission offers a unique opportunity to test the efficacy of the growing preference for an integrated approach to United Nations missions and , probably , to point the way towards improved foreign aid management . Since the Peacebuilding Commission is not a donor agency , we should all participate in decisions relating to the disbursement of its resources . Everything must be done to avoid the known pitfalls of donor practices , which have been criticized for duplication of effort , politicization and lack of local ownership , as well as for high administrative costs . The Commission is expected to take a broad approach in its work and to bring together all relevant actors in order to serve as a forum for dialogue and cooperation between national actors and the international community . It is therefore well placed to blaze a new trail in international cooperation by drawing on the knowledge , expertise and experience accumulated by the United Nations , donor agencies , international financial institutions , women , non-governmental organizations and civil society over the years so as to develop programmes that can effectively address the often complex and interrelated problems which are peculiar to each post-conflict situation . It is precisely because each conflict is sui generis that we think the Peacebuilding Commission should be encouraged to have technical meetings in the countries concerned with a view to better appreciating and understanding the internal or local situation . The Peacebuilding Commission , as it develops , should also pay due attention to the regional and subregional dimensions of peacebuilding , seeking to reinforce regional organizations in their peacebuilding efforts and to utilize their expertise . It is also our candid view that , as a newly created body , the Commission has an ideal opportunity to incorporate a gender dimension into its mandate and its work from the start . In consonance with resolution 1325 ( 2000 ) , the Peacebuilding Commission should seek to involve women in all aspects of the peacebuilding process . While we share the view that the Peacebuilding Commission can not be expected to assume the responsibilities of an elected Government , we also believe that the nature of its operations requires an appreciable level of involvement in order to win the confidence and trust of its clients . After all , it is expected to play the role of a coordinating body that leverages national and international resources . The presence of the Commission must be felt throughout the receiving State , as the traumatized population needs to be assured that the international community remains fully engaged in finding solutions to their problems . Needless to say , in order to meet the challenges of effective peacebuilding , the Peacebuilding Commission needs adequate resources . We doubt whether the quantum of money so far pledged , although commendable , is commensurate with the tasks and urgent needs in post-conflict countries . Finally , we recognize that the Peacebuilding Commission can only facilitate peace ; it can not build it . Although adequate financial resources are crucial to successful peacebuilding , it is the will and determination of the Governments and the peoples concerned to preserve the peace and change the course of their own history that ultimately constitute the most decisive factor and the best guarantee of sustainable peace and development . Mr. Kleib ( Indonesia ) : We are grateful to you , Mr. President , for convening this important meeting on post-conflict peacebuilding . Indonesia associates itself with the statement to be made shortly by the representative of Jamaica on behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement . The Peacebuilding Commission is truly a unique platform , in that it serves to bridge the current critical gap in the international post-conflict peacebuilding system . Although the Commission is still in its early stages , we recognize that the expectations are high . It is therefore the view of my delegation that this public debate should be intended as a forum for the exchange of views among the stakeholders in order to explore practical ways of strengthening the Commission and enabling it to perform its work in an effective and efficient manner . Enhanced interaction and complementarity among various United Nations organs aimed at supporting the work of the Peacebuilding Commission would be beneficial . In that context , we look forward to the expected debate on the Commission in the General Assembly , which will provide important input on how to better assist the Commission in its tasks . While the Peacebuilding Commission is expected to contribute to the advancement of global peace and stability , we are of the view that it can have a particular impact in its role as a coordinating body that leverages international and national expertise . An inclusive and well-coordinated approach would systematically synergize peacebuilding efforts at both the national and international levels . It is our opinion that the work of the Commission would be more results-oriented if integrated peacebuilding strategies fully reflect the priorities of the countries concerned . Each integrated strategy needs to be broken down into manageable phases laying out a credible set of tasks and identifying the actors concerned . It should have a degree of flexibility in order to adapt to changes on the ground . The priorities have to come from national Governments , and ownership of the post-conflict recovery process is paramount . We feel that a better coordinated , more coherent and well organized international support system , provided through the Peacebuilding Commission , would facilitate better access and response for the countries in need . Here , we would like to underline that the work of the Commission should not create a separate layer of complexity for existing processes and that the Commission should not try to micromanage the activities being carried out in the countries concerned . We must be careful , however , not to end up creating a donor-recipient culture in the Peacebuilding Commission . Due care must be exercised so that the donors to the Commission are not perceived as controlling it , because that would only draw unnecessary criticism towards the United Nations . My delegation takes note that the resolutions establishing the Peacebuilding Commission do not clearly provide modalities for the involvement of regional and subregional actors . We therefore feel that there is also a need to provide practical tools and guidance for engaging regional and subregional actors in country-specific configurations . The positive role of the relevant stakeholders is crucial to a successful transition from the post-conflict phase to the normal process of sustainable peace and development . Hence , we are pleased to see the participation of various important entities in this discussion . Their contribution is useful , not only because they provide the Council with additional ideas on how to support the work of the Peacebuilding Commission , but also because the work that they do on the ground for people ravaged by conflict is indeed very valuable and much appreciated . My delegation is also of the view that civil society and non-governmental organizations , including women's organizations , as well as the private sector , should play constructive roles in post-conflict rehabilitation and reconstruction . In the light of that , we would like to underline the need to formulate a modality enabling them to participate actively in peacebuilding activities . We are particularly encouraged by the most recent country meetings on Burundi and Sierra Leone , which were more action-oriented . We look forward to the presentation in the near future of the work plans on both countries by the respective Chairs of those country meetings . The progress made on key elements contained in the Chairs' summaries needs to be evaluated through more frequent meetings of the Peacebuilding Commission . Finally , my delegation would like to state that we need to strike a balance between the work of the Organizational Committee and the country-specific configurations , as success in one aids the other . A properly empowered and robust Committee would serve to strengthen the work of the Commission . Mr. Liu Zhenmin ( China ) ( spoke in Chinese ) : The Chinese delegation wishes to thank you , Mr. President , for organizing this meeting . We would also like to thank the representatives of the relevant bodies of the United Nations system , the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund , for their participation in today's debate . The Peacebuilding Commission was established as an outcome of the 2005 World Summit . For the first time in its history , the United Nations has a mechanism to coordinate and address post-conflict peacebuilding efforts . Despite the remarkable results achieved over the past 60 years by United Nations Blue Helmets operations in putting an end to armed conflicts , the United Nations faces a great many challenges in building sustainable peace . We hope that the Commission's establishment will herald better times for post-conflict countries and their peoples and that it will enable them to realize their dreams of peace and development at an early date . The healthy development of the Peacebuilding Commission , a newborn baby in the United Nations family , will depend on the joint efforts of all Member States ; it is also the joint responsibility of everyone . Peacebuilding in any post-conflict country is , by its very nature , a comprehensive and systematic undertaking and requires that each of the parties concerned fully play its role . First , countries under consideration at the country-specific meetings must enjoy full ownership , which is a prerequisite for successful peacebuilding . One of the Commission's main functions is to provide advice for peacebuilding in post-conflict countries and to help those countries to formulate integrated strategies . In a sense , the countries under consideration are the Commission's clients . It is only by communicating with them as much as possible and by gaining a better understanding of their needs that the Commission can establish clear objectives for its work and develop country strategies that are appropriate to their specific situations . Secondly , the Commission's function in comprehensive coordination must be enhanced . That is the key to successful peacebuilding . Coordination should be carried out at the following three levels . The first is coordination among the different plans for reconstruction in post-conflict countries . Before the Peacebuilding Commission entered the scene , a number of plans for reconstruction and framework documents may have already existed . The Commission should consolidate them into an integrated strategy and programme of action . The second level of coordination is that among different players . Peacebuilding is a complex undertaking , with a host of players , including donors , countries that by tradition are influential , international financial institutions , civil society and so forth . The Commission needs to establish and maintain channels for smooth communication among the players . The third level of coordination is that among different organs of the United Nations . The General Assembly , the Security Council and the Economic and Social Council all play an important role in peacebuilding , according to their respective mandates . The relationship between them should be complementary rather than competitive and should enable them to capitalize on their respective comparative advantages . Thirdly , the focus of the Peacebuilding Commission should be country-specific meetings so that integrated strategies and programmes of action can be formulated promptly for countries under consideration , because they constitute the very soul of peacebuilding . Having finished drafting the guidelines for its work in the initial phase , the Peacebuilding Commission should shift its focus to country-specific meetings in a timely manner . Its work should be practical , efficient , focused and action-oriented , with a view to developing integrated strategies and programmes of action that affect the specific situations of the countries under consideration . The Commission should try not to be over-ambitious and should concentrate its limited energy on solid , down-to-earth work . Only by branding and building up prestige at the outset can it attract more attention from the international community . Fourthly , the role of the Support Office should be brought into full play so as to provide guarantees and support for the effective functioning of the Peacebuilding Commission . The Support Office should not only serve as a secretariat by preparing for meetings and providing conference services , but it should also actively make bold proposals to the Commission in the fields of policy , theory and strategy by taking advantage of its wide access to a great variety of information and its extensive contacts , thereby playing the role of a good adviser . The international community , and developing countries in particular , have high expectations of the Peacebuilding Commission . This June we will celebrate the first birthday of this newborn baby . We hope that with the joint efforts of all , the Peacebuilding Commission will be able to give us a report card that pleases everyone . This will be the best birthday present it can give to itself . China is ready to join the international community in working hard towards this end . The President ( spoke in Russian ) : I shall now make a statement in my capacity as the representative of the Russian Federation . The issue of post-conflict peacebuilding has never been more topical in the context of United Nations activities , in particular those of the Security Council . Experience shows that achieving lasting peace and the effective resolution of armed conflicts is possible only on the basis of a comprehensive approach . This approach must include preventive and peacekeeping efforts , along with peacebuilding measures for post-conflict reconstruction , and ensure continuity and consistency during the transition from one phase to the next . Such an approach will allow us to create firm guarantees of regional stability and the non-renewal of conflict . An important tangible result of the decisions taken at the 2005 summit was the joint establishment by the General Assembly and the Security Council of the Peacebuilding Commission . This body , as this morning's discussion has shown has considerable practical potential and could become one of the important mechanisms of international support for the reconstruction of States that have experienced armed conflicts . In general , the Commission's work on Burundi and Sierra Leone in its first six months of existence is to be commended . We note the efforts of the Chairman of the Organizational Committee of the Commission – the Permanent Representative of Angola , Mr. Gaspar Martins , and his two country coordinators , the Permanent Representatives of Norway , Mr. Løvald , and of the Netherlands , Mr. Majoor . We must also note the considerable work done by the Peacebuilding Support Office , headed by the Assistant Secretary-General , Ms. McAskie . However , there were not just successes during this period . We suggest that the well-known difficulties are largely due to the complexity of this initial stage in setting up a commission . In its activities , particular attention should be given in the future to ensuring close coordination with the recipient countries . In this context , we welcome the participation in today's meeting of representatives of Burundi and Sierra Leone and the confirmation of their readiness to cooperate with the Peacebuilding Commission . It is important that members of the Commission conduct an impartial and collective analysis of priorities for peacebuilding in countries on their agenda , and that they develop agreed recommendations that provide assistance required both by recipient States and by the Security Council . If proper account is taken of recommendations developed together with Governments of recipient countries by the Commission , the General Assembly , the Security Council , United Nations agencies , the donor community , the international financial institutions and other interested parties , this will improve the coordination of international post-conflict support and reduce the risk of a relapse into a crisis . Particular attention must be given to enhancing cooperation between the Commission and the Security Council , particularly at this stage when Burundi and Sierra Leone are on the agenda of both bodies . It is important to establish a timely exchange of information and show a clear division of labour . Of course , this must be done while at the same time developing links between the Peacebuilding Commission , the General Assembly and the Economic and Social Council . There is a clear need for more systematic work by the Commission and more careful preparation of its country-specific meetings in order to increase their effectiveness . It is important to have a sensible mix of closed meetings and open , informal consultations within the Commission and the work of the expert groups on specific questions of Burundi and Sierra Leone . The most important component of the work of the Peacebuilding Commission is its work on the ground with national Governments and involving the United Nations country teams and the donor community . Here , additional attention must be given to harmonizing the activities of the Peacebuilding Support Office and the Commission with existing coordinating mechanisms , first and foremost within the United Nations system itself . What is needed is cooperation between the Peacebuilding Commission and United Nations agencies in the field that does not infringe upon existing United Nations operational activities but rather enhances them , including by taking account of the existence of specific cooperation programmes with recipient countries that have been endorsed by the executive boards of those United Nations agencies . The General Assembly , in our view , is precisely that forum where Member States can find an answer to this question . We welcome the initiative of the Non-Aligned Movement to hold a plenary meeting of the Assembly to discuss the work of the Peacebuilding Commission . We suggest that the interest shown in the Commission by the two main United Nations bodies is a guarantee of the close and constructive cooperation between the General Assembly and the Security Council to achieve our common goal – that is , to increase the effectiveness of international efforts in the area of peacebuilding . I now resume my functions as President of the Council . I give the floor to the representative of Germany . Mr. Matussek ( Germany ) : I have the honour to speak on behalf of the European Union ( EU ) . The candidate countries Turkey , Croatia and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia , the countries of the Stabilization and Association Process and potential candidates Albania and Serbia , and the EFTA country Iceland , member of the European Economic Area , as well as Ukraine and the Republic of Moldova align themselves with this declaration . The European Union would like to thank the Russian Federation , as presidency of the Security Council , for organizing this very timely debate on the work of the Peacebuilding Commission following the first two rounds of country-specific meetings . The European Union sees the establishment of the Peacebuilding Commission as a key achievement of the United Nations reform process . Together with the Peacebuilding Support Office and the Peacebuilding Fund , it forms the core of the United Nations new peacebuilding architecture . As a flexible instrument , the Peacebuilding Commission is "" learning by doing "" . In our view , members should be willing to work creatively within the given framework . From its inception , the European Union has supported the concept of the Commission as a body that will ensure an integrated approach to peacebuilding , taking into account the links between security , development , human rights and the rule of law . That very much corresponds to the European Union's comprehensive approach to conflict prevention , development and peacebuilding . Over the years , the European Union has developed and used an array of instruments . They include political and development-related tools , as well as conflict prevention and crisis management mechanisms . The European Union , the States members of the European Union and the European Community engage in peacebuilding activities worldwide – in Africa and Asia , as well as in the Middle East , Europe , Central Asia and Latin America . European member States and the European Community fund and implement projects in all areas of peacebuilding . A few such important areas include demobilization and reintegration , security sector reform , good governance , reconciliation efforts , child - and gender-related post-conflict assistance , trade-related measures and reconstruction operations . The European Union is committed to actively supporting the work of the Peacebuilding Commission on the basis of its experience , resources and worldwide operability . The Peacebuilding Commission has got off to a good start . After only two sets of country-specific meetings , it has identified areas of priority action for the two countries under consideration . The Commission has also established a dialogue among Governments concerned , the United Nations system , institutional donors , regional actors and members of the Peacebuilding Commission . Now , the recommendations of the Commission must be implemented in the countries concerned and within the institutional framework of the United Nations . Here , the Commission also needs the support of the Security Council , the General Assembly and the Economic and Social Council , and dialogue must be broadened in the countries concerned to include national civil society , the private sector and other relevant parties . One year after its establishment , the Commission will also have to make decisions as to its strategic goals . If the Commission is to add value to peacebuilding efforts worldwide , and particularly in the countries themselves , it will have to be ambitious . It will have to be more than the tools we already have , more than a mere coordination mechanism , and more than a donors' conference . Promoting the development of a viable peacebuilding strategy that has broad ownership is where the Peacebuilding Commission can really add value . The European Union would like to contribute to the discussion among the Commission's members on structuring the future work of the Commission and its interaction with other actors . In doing so , we would draw on our own experience in coordinating European Union programmes , as well as on the experience of the first country-specific meetings . The Commission has defined general areas of priority for each country under consideration . It will now be useful to further prioritize within those areas , in consultation with the countries concerned , United Nations country teams , donors , civil society and the private sector . Defining priorities necessarily means making a selection among a huge number of possible areas of engagement . The Peacebuilding Commission should focus on areas that have a direct and traceable link to the causes of conflict , areas in which instruments of so-called classical development are not available or functional , and areas where coordination and integration are especially needed . All peacebuilding initiatives in the field should be linked to existing strategies and programmes to avoid duplication of efforts . We want the Commission to be able to work coherently , continuously and in a result-oriented way . To achieve that , the Commission should focus on activities in the field . It should enhance cooperation with all relevant actors , including donors and non-State actors . It should make use of regular informal meetings in between formal meetings and find a way to capture and condense lessons learned from its work . The Security Council has started to discuss its relation to the Peacebuilding Commission , how to intensify communication between the Council and the Commission , and how best to achieve implementation of advice from the Commission . A similar dialogue is getting under way between the Commission and the General Assembly with the upcoming open debate in that organ . The European Union welcomes those efforts and also recognizes the contribution that the Economic and Social Council can make . There are many ways to enhance cooperation between the Peacebuilding Commission and the Security Council , the General Assembly and the Economic and Social Council . Regular meetings between the Commission chairs and the presidents of those bodies would be one possibility . Invitations to the chairs and the chairs of country-specific meetings to brief those bodies would be another . The European Union remains committed to working on integrated peacebuilding strategies with the Peacebuilding Commission and with the countries concerned . We are determined to make that key project of United Nations reform a success and to make its impact felt positively in the regions where the Peacebuilding Commission is engaged . The President ( spoke in Russian ) : I now give the floor to the representative of Jamaica . Mr. Wolfe ( Jamaica ) : First , let me congratulate you , Sir , on your assumption of the presidency of the Security Council for the month of January and for the excellent work that you and your delegation have accomplished during that period . As coordinator of the caucus of the Non-Aligned Movement ( NAM ) in the Peacebuilding Commission , I have the honour to speak on behalf of the Movement regarding the activities of the Peacebuilding Commission . There can be no denying that , in the recent past , the United Nations has seen a surge in the requirements for peacekeeping operations around the world . The role of those operations has become more complex and demanding , placing a huge responsibility on the United Nations , and as a consequence has led to a tremendous strain on existing resources . We recall that it was in response to that development that the concept of a Peacebuilding Commission was introduced in December 2004 as a result of a high-level United Nations report . It subsequently gained momentum in March 2005 when then Secretary-General Kofi Annan released his report entitled "" In larger freedom "" . In due deference to and respect for the prerogatives of the Security Council and the role of the presidency in advancing initiatives relating to international peace and security , the Non-Aligned Movement is concerned that the Security Council should at this stage find it necessary to review the work of the Peacebuilding Commission . While it is no secret that the Commission has experienced some difficulties with its internal operations and processes , we think that it is both lacking in merit and premature to have the Security Council review or evaluate its activities at this juncture , in particular in the light of the stipulation by General Assembly resolution 60 / 180 that the Peacebuilding Commission shall submit an annual report to the General Assembly , which shall hold an annual debate to review it . Since its establishment by General Assembly resolution 60 / 180 – which also established its modus operandi , among other working parameters – the Commission has met four times on matters concerning its core functions . The Commission has examined the situations in Burundi and Sierra Leone , and has approved the disbursement of much-needed finances to support crucial areas identified by key stakeholders and the Governments of both countries . The key areas are those pinpointed as most likely to lead to a relapse into conflict . The Non-Aligned Movement places significant value on the Peacebuilding Commission , in particular its role in support of national ownership of post-conflict peacebuilding priority planning and initiatives . Notwithstanding the fact that the Commission is still in its formative stages and still going through the expected teething processes , it has worked as closely as possible , under the circumstances , with national authorities to ensure national ownership of the peacebuilding process . There is concurrence , and indeed broad consensus , within the Commission that economic reconstruction and rehabilitation and a comprehensive set of risk-reduction strategies should be at the forefront of all efforts aimed at sustaining peace , initiating development and promoting post-conflict recovery . The Non-Aligned Movement emphasizes that due respect and regard must be shown for the role of the Organizational Committee in the preparation of country-specific meetings and in evaluating the progress made and charting the way forward after each country-specific meeting , based on the summaries of the meetings prepared by the respective Chairpersons , in addition to the full participation of the countries under consideration in the decision-making process . It is also useful to remind ourselves that the Peacebuilding Commission is not a donor agency , as its activities are carried out in a far broader and more comprehensive and participatory context , consistent with its mandate . Decisions regarding the provision of financial resources should therefore be guided by national priorities and be based on the collective decision of members of the Peacebuilding Commission . Recommendations for assistance must highlight the priority areas established by the Government of the country under review by the Commission . The matter of Government guidance should also be uppermost in planning the way forward , and will certainly serve to strengthen the process of national ownership . The holistic and inclusive approach to evaluation and recommendations adopted at country-specific meetings can only add to the integrity of the process within the Commission . The Non-Aligned Movement would also further like to reiterate that the Peacebuilding Commission's involvement in reconstruction efforts is based clearly on General Assembly resolution 60 / 180 , which stipulates the need for a dedicated mechanism to address the special needs of countries emerging from conflict towards recovery , reintegration and reconstruction , and to assist them in laying the foundation for sustainable development . Despite the seemingly clear channels for the Peacebuilding Commission to work towards achieving its objectives , the Non-Aligned Movement is of course concerned at certain shortcomings that , if not addressed , could have the unwanted effects of stifling its work or threatening to undermine its capability and effectiveness . The Movement would therefore like to see an increase in the frequency of meetings of the Organizational Committee to assess and evaluate strategies , attend to reconstruction and institution-building efforts and work towards developing recommendations and information to improve the coordination of all relevant actors within and outside the United Nations , among other things . Additionally , the Peacebuilding Commission must identify the means by which funds that are approved for disbursement reach recipient countries in the shortest possible time . It is not sufficient to identify the urgency of the need while paying scant regard to , or becoming lax in , follow-up actions at the most crucial stage . It is necessary to strengthen the role and the work of the Organizational Committee as the entity governing the work of the Peacebuilding Commission . In that regard , the Commission is the body responsible and entitled to elaborate on the guidelines regarding meetings in the country-specific format , as well as the work of the Peacebuilding Support Office . We would therefore call on all to avoid any action that could be construed as undermining the authority of the Organizational Committee . Looking ahead , the Non-Aligned Movement is convinced that the upcoming debate in the General Assembly will undoubtedly enrich the awareness of the general membership as to the progress being made within the Peacebuilding Commission , notably in addressing the outstanding organizational and substantive issues . That debate will of course add value to the open debate now taking place in the Security Council , and will not only increase the momentum of the follow-up to the multi-dimensional aspects of the cases under consideration within the Commission but will also enhance its effectiveness , in line with the respective prerogatives and responsibilities of both organs . The caucus of the Non-Aligned Movement in the Peacebuilding Commission would like to take this opportunity to express its appreciation to the Ambassador of Angola , Chairperson of the Organizational Committee of the Peacebuilding Commission , as well as to the Chairpersons of the country-specific meetings and the Peacebuilding Support Office , for the successful outcome of the country-specific meetings held to date . The Movement would also like to encourage the wider membership of the Peacebuilding Commission to remain unrelenting and vigilant in efforts to consolidate the gains and achievements made to date , so as to mitigate the possibility of countries under consideration relapsing into conflict . The President ( spoke in Russian ) : I now give the floor to the representative of Chile . Mr. Muñoz ( Chile ) ( spoke in Spanish ) : I would first like to associate myself with the statement made by the Permanent Representative of Jamaica on behalf of the member countries of the Non-Aligned Movement members of the Peacebuilding Commission . The Peacebuilding Commission is currently in the process of establishing its identity in order to put its imprint on its efforts , in line with the mandates conferred upon it by the resolutions that established it . We believe that the central matter as regards the Commission's future is the issue of its relevance . Since it is not a new donor entity – notwithstanding the importance of the Peacebuilding Fund – it is essential that the Commission be given the leadership role in mobilizing and coordinating resources and efforts in support of countries emerging from conflict . The Peacebuilding Commission must not become a body for academic debates . It should instead be in the field providing advice and working with countries emerging from conflict . To that end , it is essential to strengthen ties with international financing institutions , such as the World Bank , the International Monetary Fund and regional banks , as well as with the community of donor countries . We welcome the efforts made in that regard . Likewise , we believe it is necessary to adopt the necessary measures to ensure the broadest possible participation by all relevant actors in the search for solutions to the most pressing problems encountered by countries emerging from conflict , including participation by civil society . In the future it will be necessary to strengthen the role and work of the Organizational Committee as the managerial body of the Commission – in particular its country-specific format , which is key . We believe it is urgent to avoid competing visions that could weaken the work of the Peacebuilding Commission . This requires action agreed between the General Assembly and the Security Council , as well as proper coordination with the Economic and Social Council . With a view to strengthening the work of the Organizational Committee of the Peacebuilding Commission , we believe it is necessary to establish an annual calendar of formal meetings , leaving the necessary flexibility to carry out informal meetings whenever necessary , either in a country-specific format or another format . We observe with concern the persistence of discussion on how to carry out the work of the Peacebuilding Commission . National ownership in determining and carrying out national priorities is , of course , a basic premise in this respect . National priorities are identified as a result of an internal process of consultation carried out by the national Government , with participation of various national actors . But in our opinion , defining national priorities is a two-way street , and the Peacebuilding Commission can not be excluded . One of the main purposes of the Peacebuilding Commission , according to resolution 1645 ( 2005 ) is "" To bring together all relevant actors to marshal resources and to advise on and propose integrated strategies for post-conflict peacebuilding and recovery "" ( para . We are pleased that in the months since its work began , the Peacebuilding Commission has addressed the cases of Burundi and Sierra Leone . During this period , specific plans of action were reviewed for both countries , with the active participation of the national authorities of those countries ; the contribution of the Peacebuilding Support Office in approving the disbursement of significant assistance for both countries was valuable . This year we should follow up on the status of the implementation of the agreed programmes . It will also be necessary for all of us to make efforts to replenish the resources of the Peacebuilding Fund . Lastly , beyond the required reports mandated by the resolutions , we feel that at this stage the most important thing is for the Peacebuilding Commission to make active cooperation with countries emerging from conflict a priority . The President ( spoke in Russian ) : There are still a number of speakers remaining on my list for this meeting . As announced at the outset of the meeting , I intend , with the concurrence of members of the Council , to suspend the meeting until 3.30 p. m . sharp . The meeting was suspended at 12.55 p. m . This record contains the text of speeches delivered in English and of the interpretation of speeches delivered in the other languages . The final text will be printed in the Official Records of the Security Council . Corrections should be submitted to the original languages only . They should be incorporated in a copy of the record and sent under the signature of a member of the delegation concerned to the Chief of the Verbatim Reporting Service , room C-154A . </doc>

1413,A7,"Most people who have moderately arched feet mistakenly think they require motion control or shoes for flat feet . People often overestimate the amount their ankles roll inwards during their running cycle . Worse is that new runners often enjoy overpronating excessively . A simple correction of the running gait should be first checked especially for people with moderate arches Ask anyone about beautiful feet and they 'll always describe high arches . Society has attributed high arch feet to beauty and flat feet to strength . Consequently supportive bulky looking shoes for flat feet look like tanks while the pliable neutral shoes for high arches look sexy . This is a problem for some consumers because it has been noted that most buy shoes by the way they look . This is exacerbated by moderately arched women runners who tend to choose shoes that offer little support to their mild overpronation . They key here is to choose shoes for function first then appearance next . Moderately arched runners should realize that the best shoes for them are those that look like a cross between bulky sneakers and light neutrals . Shoes offering stability are flooding the market . But since they tend to cater to people whose gaits range from mild overpronation to moderate overpronation it can be a challenge to find the right one . Truth to be told motion control sneakers will fill better than the wrong pair of stability treads . Read reviews of these running shoes to find out if they provide too little or too much support for your unique foot . Remember not all moderately arched feet require the same amount of overpronation protection . You need the right form of stability to avoid injuries . </doc>

316,A7,"Rats That Bite There is an argument that suggests that any rat that bites should be humanely destroyed , as a biting rat is not acceptable as a pet . While I agree with that in part , there are also a whole host of reasons why this does not have to be the ' unwritten law ' of rat keeping . Pet rats are generally kept in cages - they can not bite anyone outside their cage , only someone who infringes on their territory by putting their fingers through the bars , or their hand through the door . Being a biter does not necessarily make the rat dangerous ( as long as you follow basic rules , like NOT sticking your fingers through the bars ) , neither does it mean that the rat in question ca n ' t have a long and fulfilled life ( it may be perfectly happy with cage mates ) . As an owner , you have to decide whether you are willing to accept the constraints of a biting rat and whether you are willing to put in the time and effort to correct this character flaw . You also have to consider , especially if there are children involved , whether it is realistic to even attempt to do this - it may be wiser to pass the rat over to someone else who is less interested in having the rat as a cuddly pet . It is very rare for pet rats to aggressively bite , but they can and will bite for a whole host of other reasons . Understanding the reason ( s ) can help an owner overcome the problem , or at least allow themselves not to be hurt when dealing with a particular rat , as well as allowing the rat to lead as normal a life as possible . The primary cause of any bite is fear . A well-socialised regularly handled rat is highly unlikely to bite compared to a solitary un-handled rat . Unfortunately , unless you buy your rats from reputable breeders , you will have no way of telling how socialised your new friends are until you try to pick them up - they may be used to the person in the pet shop , picking them up for short periods or shooing them out of the way while their cages are cleaned , but that does not mean they can cope with , or understand , the loving attentiveness of a new owner . As an owner you must be patient and understanding , giving your new friends time to settle into their new environment and introducing yourself to them slowly and carefully . Start off by just resting your hand in their cage , so they can get used to your smell , or try putting an old t-shirt that you 've recently worn in their cage . You will be able to tell , quite easily , which of your new rats are nervous and which are quite happy to see you : nervous rats will cower , run away , move in a jerky manner and make every attempt to avoid your hand at all costs ! This is when you need to be extra patient because the one thing that will get a rat to investigate you is curiosity . By talking calmly to the rats and not making any sudden movements , even the shyest of kittens will try and sneak a sniff , a lick or even a ' is it edible ? ' nip ( which wo n ' t hurt you at all ! ) . Trust building exercises , like letting rats lick yummy stuff from your fingers , help to teach the rat to associate hands with nice things and also that fingers are not for biting , only for licking . When venturing to pick up your baby rats , NEVER EVER pick them up by the tail - either use a scooping motion supporting the tummy , or place your first 2 fingers either side of their neck , just above the shoulders , with your thumb and remaining fingers supporting their tummy . You obviously ca n ' t do this with bigger rats , unless you have big hands ! Once you 've scooped them up you must support their feet : rats feel very vunerable when left dangling in mid-air ! When you first get your baby rats out of their cage , do n't go too far with them - stay close to the cage so that they can still smell it and , if they panic , you can easily put them back . You must handle your baby rats daily , for at least 20 minutes - there is a theory that a baby rat can not stay frightened for more than 20 minutes so , by handling them for at least this length of time in any one go , they will realise that there 's nothing to be frightened of . However , some rats are far more nervous than others , and can show obvious distress at being handled after only a very short time . Stress is very bad for rats so I would suggest that nervous rats should have their handling time gradually increased - a little amount of handling but several times a day . If they are particularly nervous you will need to make sure they do n't associate your visits with just being handled : on one visit to the cage handle them , on the next give them a treat , on the next just have your hand in etc. If you do have nervous babies , it may be worth considering not giving them a covered bed or bolt-hole in their cage : this may seem a bit harsh but most pet shops do not provide cover and , for the first few weeks at least , it will be easier for you to handle the rats if you do n't have to chase them round the cage or fish them out of a hidey-hole ! Gradual but continual ( and that 's the key ! ) trust building will socialise your rats in no time and , though it wo n ' t guarantee a shoulder or lap rat ( that depends on the personality of the rat ) , it will almost certainly guarantee that your baby rats wo n ' t grow up to be biters ! Older rats that bite are more of a problem and the reasons behind their biting can be more complex and harder to figure out . If you ' adopt ' an adult biter , you have no way of telling whether it has been handled regularly , whether it has been mistreated or whether it is insecure and unsocialised . Trust training can also work with adult rats , though will probably take longer and require a lot more persistence on your part . Thick gardening gloves can be worn to minimise the risk of damage to fingers , or some people use a thick towel to scoop or catch the rat in , should it be necessary to handle it . You have to decide whether this will stress the rat out and undo all your hard work of trust training , or whether you should ignore the handling aspect of socialising your rat until it feels safe in your company and is used to you lightly touching or brushing it with your fingers . There is no need to feel rushed in your socialisation and trust training of your new rat - each rat is different and each will take their own time to ' come round ' to your way of thinking ! Being naturally sociable animals , it is very rare for a rat to just be aggressive and unhandleable with no hope of character redemption , but any rat that exhibits outward unprovoked aggression should NEVER be bred from . Responsible breeders breed as much for character as they do for colouring and they socialise their rats almost from birth , getting them used to being handled from an early age - a good reason to consider buying your rats from breeders rather than pet shops , which can sometimes breed and sell rodents for reptile food ( ' feeders ' ) and are consequently uninterested in the character and health of the animals they produce . Whether from a breeder or a shop always get at least a pair of same sex rats . If buying from a pet shop , unless you know the shop to be reputable , get young , recently weaned rats . Wherever you buy your new pets from , the time spent building bonds can be one of the most rewarding experiences of rat ownership , so have fun ! </doc>

1087,A14,"Increases in Sex with Same-Sex Partners and Bisexual Identity Across Cohorts of Women ( but Not Men ) Paula England , Emma Mishel , Mónica L. Caudillo New York University Abstract : We use data from the 2002 – 2013 National Surveys of Family Growth to examine change across U.S. cohorts born between 1966 and 1995 in whether individuals have had sex with same-sex partners only , or with both men and women , and in whether they have a bisexual or gay identity . Adjusted for age , race / ethnicity , immigrant status , and mother's education , we find increases across cohorts in the proportion of women who report a bisexual identity , who report ever having had sex with both sexes , or who report having had sex with women only . By contrast , we find no cohort trend for men ; roughly 5 percent of men in every cohort have ever had sex with a man , and the proportion claiming a gay or bisexual attraction changed little . We speculate that this gender difference is rooted in a broader pattern of asymmetry in gender change in which departures from traditional gender norms are more acceptable for women than men . Keywords : sexualities ; gender ; bisexuality ; homosexuality ; cohorts is often recognized that norms about gender and sexuality are linked , such that one violates gender norms by identifying as gay or bisexual , or by having sex with a same-sex partner ( Pascoe 2007 ; England 2016 ) . What is less often recognized is a link between trends in the gender and sexuality systems . Gender change has been asymmetric , with women taking on traditionally male activities more than vice versa ( England 2010 ) . Consistent with this more general pattern , we will show that the proportion of women who have had sex with a same-sex partner or who identify as bisexual has increased , with no parallel change for men . Several recent papers , focused mostly on period change in the 1990s and early 2000s , note an upward trend in sex with same-sex partners ( Turner et al. 2005 ; Butler 2005 ; Twenge et al. 2016 ) . Our study takes a cohort rather than period perspective , examining change across birth cohorts born between 1966 and 1995 . We use data from the National Surveys of Family Growth ( NSFG ) collected between 2002 and 2013 . Separately for men and women , we examine change across cohorts in sex with same-sex partners and in gay or bisexual identities using models that adjust for respondents' age , race , ethnicity , immigrant status , and socioeconomic background ( measured with mother's education ) . We also examine whether trends have been significantly different along these dimensions . To foreshadow , we find substantial evidence of increases in women's sexual behavior with same-sex partners and in women's bisexual identity , but little change for men . We also find that trends differ little by race , ethnicity , immigration status , or socioeconomic background . I Citation : England , Paula , Emma Mishel , and Mónica L. Caudillo . 2016 .

Using data from the General Social Survey ( GSS ) , Anderson and Stall ( 2002 ) found an increase from 1 to 2 percent to 3 to 4 percent between 1988 to 2000 in the percentage of men who had had sex with a man in the last year . They did not examine trends for women . Turner et al. ( 2005 ) also used GSS data ( 1988 – 2002 ) and found substantial increases in same-sex sexual behavior for women in the 1990s in whether women had sex with a same-sex partner in the last year , the last five years , or ever . For men , they found an increase only on the measure of same-sex activity in the last year , although it was much smaller than the increase for women ; they found no increase for men in same-sex activity in the last five years or ever . Twenge et al. ( 2016 ) used the GSS data from 1988 – 2014 and found that the proportion who had at least one same-sex partner since age 18 increased , from 3.6 to 8.7 percent for women and from 4.5 to 8.2 percent for men . Using 1988 – 2002 GSS data , augmented by the 1992 National Health and Social Life Survey , Butler ( 2005 ) found increases in the percentage of men and women who had sex with a same-sex partner in the previous year across the period , with a faster rate of change for women . A recent analysis by Copen et al. ( 2016 : 5 ) , using a subset of the NSFG data we use , found an increase between the 2006 – 2010 and the 2011 – 2013 NSFG surveys in the proportion of women who reported same-sex contact , but no change for men . Copen et al. ( 2016 ) is the only study of change in sexual orientation ; they found an increase in the proportion of both men and women who claimed a bisexual identity across the very short period from 2006 – 2010 to 2011 – 2013 . Taken as a whole , these studies , all of which focused on period trends centered on the 1990s or early 2000s , suggest increases for women in sex with same-sex partners , with mixed findings on whether there is no change or smaller changes for men . 1 Change Across Cohorts Research on cohort change in sexualities is sparse . Butler ( 2005 ) , whose main analysis focused on period change , provided information on change in having had a same-sex partner since age 18 across cohorts born between 1929 and 1982 , finding significant increases for women , but not for men . These analyses had no control for age or other compositional covariates . Likewise , Turner et al. ( 2005 ) , although focusing on period change , also examined cohort change in the proportions of men and women reporting any same-sex partner since age 18 , finding increases from 1.6 percent for the cohort of women born before 1920 to 6.9 percent for those born 1970 – 1984 , but no cohort change for men . This cohort analysis was from a model with no covariates , even for age , and thus could be a function of period change or compositional demographic change . Twenge et al. ( 2016 ) , discussed above , argued that the upward change in having had sex with a same-sex partner sociological science | www.sociologicalscience.com 952 November 2016 | Volume 3 England , Mishel , and Caudillo Women's Increasing Bisexuality identified in their GSS analysis is a period rather than a cohort effect . However , this conclusion is suspect , given that the techniques they used , proposed by Yang and Land ( 2013 ) , have been shown via simulation not to identify cohort effects in many cases where they exist ( Bell and Jones 2014 ) . Thus , in sum , there are no studies of change across cohorts in sexual orientation , and the studies examining cohort trends in sex with same sex partners are all flawed by lack of sociodemographic controls or an inappropriate method of separating cohort from period effects . We will focus on cohort change , controlling for age and other covariates , but make no claims about how much of the net cohort change we observe is a cohort or period "" effect . "" Limitations of Past Research and Our Contribution As mentioned above , past research suggests an increase in sex with same-sex partners , but all studies focused on period change , and any cohort analyses they provided were flawed . Thus , one of our contributions is to provide an analysis of cohort change sexual behavior and sexual orientation using models that control for age and other sociodemographic variables . None of the studies we reviewed distinguished between those who have sex with both men and women and those who have sex only with same-sex partners ( either ever , or in a given time period ) . 2 Thus , our second contribution is to make this distinction ; as we will show , the proportion of women who have had sex with both men and women , as well as the proportion having sex with women only , has increased . Past research is also limited in that most studies have focused only on behavior . We located no studies examining cohort trends in sexual orientation , so our third contribution is to do so . In sum , our contribution is to provide the first multivariate analysis of cohort change in having sex with same-sex partners only , having sex with same - and other-sex partners , and identifying as bisexual or gay . Data and Methods Data We pooled data from the 2002 , 2006 – 2010 , and 2011 – 2013 waves of the NSFG . In all of these waves , there was an Audio Computer-Assisted Self-Interview ( ACASI ) section administered in private that included questions about one's sexual orientation and whether one had same-sex sexual partners . Because this portion of the questionnaire was not face-to-face ( the interviewer let the respondent answer on the computer after he / she stepped away ) , answers about stigmatized behaviors and identities may have less reporting bias . Two recent studies that compared ACASI to standard methods disagree regarding whether it increases reporting of sexual behavior , attraction , or orientation that is not heteronormative . Villarroel et al. ( 2006 ) find that a higher proportion of respondents report sexual behavior with or attraction to same-sex partners with ACASI , whereas Dahlhamer et al. ( 2014 ) find no significant difference in reporting a nonheterosexual orientation with ACASI . 3 sociological science | www.sociologicalscience.com 953 November 2016 | Volume 3 England , Mishel , and Caudillo Women's Increasing Bisexuality Variables Dependent variables : sexual behavior . To construct our behavioral dependent variables regarding sexual behavior , we used the questions on same-sex sexual partners in the ACASI section and the questions on sexual intercourse with other-sex partners in the main questionnaires to identify whether each respondent had ( 1 ) had sex with other - and same-sex partners or ( 2 ) had sex only with same-sex partners . ( Those not in the preceding categories of interest had had sex only with other-sex partners , or with no one . ) Respondents were asked questions that put them in these categories with respect to their sexual behavior ever and their behavior in the last 12 months . The specific questions we used from the ACASI section are as follows : "" Thinking about your entire life , how many [ same - ] sex partners have you had ? "" and "" Thinking about the last 12 months , how many [ same - ] sex partners have you had ? "" Women were asked these questions if they stated yes to a prior question about whether they had ever had "" sexual experience of any kind with another woman "" or yes to one of two prior questions about whether they had ever given or received oral sex to / from a woman . ( In 2002 only , the oral sex questions were not asked , so women were asked how many same-sex partners they have had , last year or ever , only if they answered yes to ever having had sexual experience with a woman . ) Men were asked their number of male sexual partners , ever or last year , only if they answered yes to either of two previous questions regarding whether they had ever had oral or anal sex with a man . Respondents who did not get asked the questions about number of same-sex partners because of their negative responses to the prior questions were assumed to have had no same-sex partners . To measure other-sex sexual activity , we relied on the NSFG official recodes for number of other-sex sexual partners with whom respondents had intercourse ever , and in the last 12 months , based on information provided in face-to-face interviews using the survey's main questionnaires . Using the combination of these variables allowed us to ascertain whether each respondent had ever had sex with at least one man and woman , or only with one or more women , or only with one or more men . This was our main behavioral dependent variable . In a supplementary analysis , we also used these measures of behavior for the last year . One potential problem in comparing women's and men's levels of sex with same-sex partners is that the different screening questions used to path men and women into questions about same-sex partnerships appear at first glance to have created a higher bar for men than for women to be seen as having had a same-sex partner . That is , men were n't asked how many male sexual partners they had had ( and thus were assumed to have had none ) unless they said they had oral or anal sex with a man , whereas women could be classified as having had sex with a woman if they said they had had any sexual experience with a woman , even if they did not report having had oral sex with a woman . Recent attention to the prevalence of women kissing women on dance floors and at parties ( Rupp et al. 2014 ; Hamilton 2007 ) raises the question of whether women reporting sexual experience with women are referring to experiences such as these or to more private sexual contact involving genitals . In analyses not shown , we ascertained that 91 percent of women of age 18 – 45 who said they had sex with a woman last year sociological science | www.sociologicalscience.com 954 November 2016 | Volume 3 England , Mishel , and Caudillo Women's Increasing Bisexuality ( regardless of whether they also said they had sex with a man ) also reported that they had ever had oral sex with a woman , as did 88 percent of ( the overlapping group of ) women who reported having sex with both men and women last year . 4 This suggests that the vast majority of those who say they have had a female sexual partner have had private sexual experiences with women beyond kissing . We are thus relatively unconcerned that the measures artifactually create a higher bar for men than women reporting on sexual behavior . Dependent variables : identity and attraction . To assess identity , we used a question that asked respondents whether they see themselves as "" heterosexual or straight , "" "" homosexual , gay , or lesbian , "" or "" bisexual . "" 5 Whether we are referring to men or women , we will use the term "" gay "" ( as opposed to "" lesbian "" ) for brevity and to facilitate comparing analyses across genders . One complication is that in the 2002 wave and part of the 2006 – 2010 wave ( through June 2008 ) , respondents were given the option of choosing "" something else "" to describe their sexual orientation ; we treated respondents who gave this response as in the reference category ( with heterosexuals ) . In supplemental analyses , we also use current attraction , a 5-point scale with categories for only attracted to females , mostly attracted to females , equally attracted to males and females , mostly attracted to males , and only attracted to males ( with gender order reversed for female respondents ) . We treated respondents who chose "" not sure "" as having a missing value , so they were eliminated from the analysis . We recoded the categories into heterosexual attraction ( only attracted to the other sex ) , bisexual attraction ( attracted mostly to either sex , or equally to both ) , and gay attraction ( attracted only to one's own sex ) . Independent variables . Our main independent variable of interest is respondent's birth cohort , represented by indicator variables . The categories containing enough respondents for analysis are 1966 – 1974 , 1975 – 1979 , 1980 – 1984 , and 1985 – 1995 ; we eliminated respondents born between 1957 and 1965 . We do not enter period into our main models , but we do employ detailed controls for age – indicator variables for each single year of age at survey . We will focus on cohort change but make no claims about cohort versus period "" effects "" given the difficulty of distinguishing them ( Bell and Jones 2014 ) . Control variables include indicator variables for the following race / ethnic groups : Non-Hispanic White ( hereafter white ) , Non-Hispanic Black ( hereafter black ) , Hispanic , and Other . We also control for immigration status ( = 1 if not born in the United States ) and an interaction for Hispanic X Immigrant that preliminary analysis showed to be needed . The other control we used was respondent's mother's education , represented by indicator variables for completing Less than High School , High School ( including those with some college but not a Bachelor's degree ) , or a Bachelor's degree or higher . These variables enter our main models to control for compositional change along these dimensions , removing its effects from our estimates of cohort change in sexual outcomes . In separate analyses , these variables are also used to examine whether the gender-specific trends in sexual outcomes that we identify vary along these dimensions . sociological science | www.sociologicalscience.com 955 November 2016 | Volume 3 England , Mishel , and Caudillo Women's Increasing Bisexuality Table 1 : Means by gender .

Means on all variables , separately for men and women , are in Table 1 . All of our analyses incorporate survey weights corresponding to the relevant data collection years . Models Main models . We estimated a series of logistic regressions . Each regression is comprised of the cohort indicators as the primary independent variables , as well as all the control variables discussed above . Our goal is to get point estimates of the amount of change in each dependent variable between cohorts . The controls for age are intended to help us distinguish between cohort and life cycle differences , given that the cohorts differ in the age distribution of respondents in the survey . Because of the familiar age-period-cohort identification problem , we do not put the survey year ( period ) in our main models , and , thus , the cohort trends that we estimate may contain a combination of cohort and period effects . We control for race , ethnicity , sociological science | www.sociologicalscience.com 956 November 2016 | Volume 3 England , Mishel , and Caudillo Women's Increasing Bisexuality immigration status , and mother's education because these variables may affect sexual behavior or identity , and , thus , compositional change across birth cohorts might create cohort effects . For example , we will show a much lower rate of samesex sexual behavior by Hispanic immigrants than other groups ; given this , and the fact that the proportion of successive cohorts made up of Hispanic immigrants increased ( results not shown ) , failure to control for this compositional factor would , all else equal , lead to an underestimate of any increase ( or overestimate of any decrease ) in sex with same-sex partners . We seek to identify change across cohorts , which is not driven merely by compositional changes in our measured control variables , but which is driven by changing behavior within these groups ; the controls accomplish this . All models are estimated separately for men and women , allowing us to examine whether trends differ by gender . For each gender , we estimate logistic regression models that predict the following dependent variables : • Model 1 : Has had male and female sexual partners ever . • Model 2 : Has had only same-sex sexual partners ever . Each of these has a reference category that contains all categories other than the one listed . Thus , the reference categories for models 1 and 2 are overlapping , such that those who have had no sexual partners or only those of the other sex are in the reference category for both models , whereas those with both sexes as partners are in the reference category only for model 2 , and those with only same-sex partners are in the reference category only for model 1 . To examine cohort change in sexual orientation ( identity ) , we estimate two logistic regression models that predict dependent variables measuring the sexual orientation the respondent identifies with • Model 3 : Bisexual • Model 4 : Gay Each of these has a reference category that includes the other and also includes those who answered heterosexual ( and , in the years when it was an option , something else ) . Supplementary analyses . In an analysis discussed but for which full regression results are not presented , we estimated models parallel to 1 and 2 , regarding sex with same - and other sex partners , or same-sex partners only , but referring to partners in the last year ( rather than ever ) . In another supplementary analysis discussed but not displayed in our regression tables , we ran models parallel to 3 and 4 but taking bisexual and gay attraction ( as specified above ) as the dependent variables rather than identifying as bisexual or gay . We also undertake supplementary analyses to examine whether cohort trends we identify in any of our main models discussed above differ by race , ethnicity , or nativity . To do this , we estimate separate models for whites , blacks , U.S. - born Hispanics , Hispanic immigrants , and others . We then examine the significance of sociological science | www.sociologicalscience.com 957 November 2016 | Volume 3 England , Mishel , and Caudillo Women's Increasing Bisexuality differences between cohort coefficients in the models for whites and each other group . We discuss these findings , but they are not shown in our regression tables . Analogously , to see if those from different socioeconomic backgrounds experienced distinct trends , we estimate separate models for each group defined by mother's education and examine the significance of differences between cohort coefficients for those whose mothers had not completed high school and each other group . Predicted probabilities . From all of our models , we calculated predicted probabilities of observing the sexual behaviors , identities , or attractions of interest across cohorts . We used the "" Margins "" procedure in STATA , thus using an average marginal effects approach , which assumes the control variables to have the distribution observed for the whole ( male or female ) sample in each cohort . Sensitivity tests . These tests are described , along with their results , in the online supplement . None of them changed the substantive conclusions from our main analyses . Results : Changes in Women's Behavior and Identity Overall Trends Table 2 presents our main regression analyses for women , in which cohort change is estimated under controls , as detailed above . Model 1 reveals the cohort change in whether women have had sexual partners of both sexes ( ever ) , whereas model 2 does the same for having had only women as partners . Each successive cohort shows a significant elevation from the reference birth cohort ( 1966 – 74 ) , and increases are monotonic . Model 3 also shows significant monotonic upward trends in identifying as bisexual . Model 4 shows some increase in identifying as gay in the last two cohorts , but not enough to be statistically significant . We can see the levels of these behaviors and identities and the magnitude of change more clearly in Table 3 , containing predicted probabilities for each cohort , calculated from the models in Table 2 and some of our supplementary models on related outcomes . Table 3 shows that the predicted percent of women who had ever had sex with both men and women increased from 10.3 percent in the 1966 – 74 birth cohort to 19.7 percent in the 1985 – 95 cohort . The percentage of women who had ever had sex with only female partners , always very small , nonetheless rose significantly from 0.2 percent to 1.5 percent from the first to last birth cohort . Having had partners of both sexes , as well as having had only female partners in the last year , also increased , but the regressions ( not shown ) do n't show these increases to be significant . Bisexual identity increased significantly from 2.7 percent to 7.2 percent across the four cohorts , whereas bisexual attraction increased significantly from 13.8 percent to 19.5 percent . Gay identity , always much smaller than bisexual identity , did not rise significantly , whereas gay attraction , also much rarer than bisexual attraction , rose at marginal significance . In sum , across the four cohorts spanning those born from 1966 to 1995 , we find that having had sex with same-sex partners , bisexual identity , and attraction to sociological science | www.sociologicalscience.com 958 November 2016 | Volume 3 England , Mishel , and Caudillo Women's Increasing Bisexuality Table 2 : Odds ratios from four logistic regressions predicting whether women ( 1 ) have had male and female sexual partners ( ever ) , ( 2 ) have had only female sexual partners ( ever ) , ( 3 ) identify as bisexual , and ( 4 ) identify as gay . 1 2 3 4 1.467 † ( 0 . 153 ) 1.733 † ( 0 . 229 ) 2.178 † ( 0 . 328 ) 4.012 † ( 1 . 860 ) 7.287 † ( 4 . 847 ) 8.760 † ( 5 . 805 ) 1.673 † ( 0 . 325 ) 1.949 † ( 0 . 452 ) 2.847 † ( 0 . 721 ) 0.944 ( 0 . 260 ) 1.12 ( 0 . 443 ) 1.436 ( 0 . 582 ) 0.692 † ( 0 . 078 ) 0.86 ( 0 . 077 ) 0.609 † ( 0 . 110 ) 0.451 † ( 0 . 085 ) 0.376 † ( 0 . 107 ) 2.168 ( 0 . 862 ) 1.38 ( 0 . 467 ) 1.666 ( 0 . 821 ) 1.533 ( 0 . 777 ) 0.134 ∗ ( 0 . 115 ) 0.738 ( 0 . 115 ) 0.8 ( 0 . 108 ) 1.117 ( 0 . 275 ) 0.824 ( 0 . 189 ) 0.349 † ( 0 . 125 ) 1.205 ( 0 . 366 ) 1.329 ( 0 . 296 ) 1.728 ( 0 . 560 ) 0.978 ( 0 . 328 ) 0.304 ∗ ( 0 . 148 ) 1.124 ( 0 . 090 ) 1.05 ( 0 . 117 ) 19,699 0.81 ( 0 . 294 ) 1.577 ( 0 . 577 ) 18,929 0.744 ∗ ( 0 . 106 ) 0.625 † ( 0 . 102 ) 19,577 0.671 ( 0 . 159 ) 1.009 ( 0 . 288 ) 19,577 Cohort ( ref : 66 – 74 ) Born 75 – 79 Born 80 – 84 Born 85 – 95 Race ( ref : White ) Hispanic Black Other Immigrant Hispanic x Immigrant Mother's Education ( ref : < HS ) HS / Some College BA or more N † p < 0.01 ; ∗ p < 0.05 , two-tailed test .

The increases for behavior and identity can be seen in Figures 1 and 2 . Do Trends Differ by Race , Ethnicity , and Immigrant Status ? The same general picture of increases across cohorts in sexual experience with same-sex partners applies to all groups of women , as Figures 3 and 4 show . To ascertain this , for the four outcomes in Table 2 , we estimated separate regressions for the following groups : Non-Hispanic whites , Non-Hispanic blacks , U.S. - born Hispanics , and Hispanic immigrants .

Trends in having ever had sex with both sexes are not significantly different between groups , except that increases for black women are much steeper than those for whites , starting at a ( non-significantly ) lower level in the first cohort and rising to a much higher level . The other difference is that the upward trend in bisexual identity is not seen for Hispanic immigrants . Predicted values show that Hispanics , especially Hispanic immigrants , have the lowest level of any of these behaviors or identities that indicate lack of exclusive heterosexuality . Overall , the conclusion is that all of these groups have upward trends in sex with same-sex partners that are the same as or steeper than those for non-Hispanic whites . Other than Hispanic immigrants , whose bisexual identity did not rise across cohorts , all had a rise in bisexual identity no different than that for white women . We also examined whether cohort trends vary by socioeconomic background , as measured by mother's education , finding almost no differences . Specifically , there were no significant differences between the cohort effects for these groups of women in having had sex with both sexes , having had sex only with women , or gay identity . The upward cohort effects on bisexual identity were larger for the group with the lowest mother's education , and one of these differences ( the elevation between the first and second of the four cohorts ) was significant . Overall , these monotonic upward cohort trends occurred among women of all socioeconomic backgrounds . Thus , it is certainly incorrect to say that the rise of nonheterosexual behaviors and identities is occurring primarily among socioeconomically privileged white women . sociological science | www.sociologicalscience.com 960 November 2016 | Volume 3 England , Mishel , and Caudillo Women's Increasing Bisexuality Figure 1 : Women's and men's predicted probability of having had sex with same-and other-sex partners , by birth cohort . Rather , these trends largely transcend race and class , and , if anything , some are steeper in less privileged groups . Results for Men We find no upward trend across cohorts in whether men have had sex with only men , or with both men and women , ever or last year , and no upward trend in either gay or bisexual identity or attraction . The last cohort is never significantly above the first in any of the outcomes ( Tables 4 and 5 ) . On one of the four outcomes ( gay identity ) , the likelihood went down significantly between the first and second cohort . The overall lack of upward trend is not significantly different for groups of men from varying class backgrounds , defined by their mother's education ( results not shown ) . The lack of trend is true within race / ethnic and nativity groups as well for most outcomes ( race-specific regression results not shown , but see Figures 5 and sociological science | www.sociologicalscience.com 961 November 2016 | Volume 3 England , Mishel , and Caudillo Women's Increasing Bisexuality Figure 2 : Women's and men's predicted probability of identifying as bisexual or gay , by birth cohort . 6 for trends in same-sex sexual behavior and gay or bisexual identity separately by race ) . 6 Our findings differ by gender , not only in the lack of an upward trend for men but also in the lower baseline levels of departures from exclusive heterosexuality for men , as can be seen in Figures 1 and 2 . As Table 5 , giving predicted probabilities , shows , in every cohort , between 3.5 percent and 4.8 percent of men have ever had both sexes as partners , and between 0.8 percent and 1.5 percent had had only same-sex partners , with no significant upward trend in either . Adding the two groups together , between 4 percent and 6 percent of men had ever had a same-sex partner in each cohort ( Table 5 ) ; by contrast , for women this was 10.5 percent in the first cohort and 21.2 percent in the last ( Table 3 ) . The percentage of men identifying as gay did not rise , estimated at 2.8 percent , 1.4 percent , 1.6 percent , and 1.7 percent , respectively , in the four cohorts ( Table 5 ) . Men's bisexual identity did rise from 1.3 percent to 2.4 percent ( Table 5 ) , but this is not significant ( Table 4 ) . Thus , the clear conclusion is that things changed for women , but not for men , and that by the most sociological science | www.sociologicalscience.com 962 November 2016 | Volume 3 England , Mishel , and Caudillo Women's Increasing Bisexuality Figure 3 : Women's predicted probability of having had sex with same-and other-sex partners , by birth cohort and race . recent cohort , a much higher proportion of women than men had had sex with both sexes and claimed a bisexual identity . 7 Discussion and Conclusion We have shown a steady increase across cohorts in women's experience with samesex partners . The upward trend is present for women having had sex only with women , as well as having sex with both sexes . The proportion of women identifying as bisexual and reporting bisexual attraction has also grown . These upward trends are no less steep among blacks , U.S. - born Hispanics , and Hispanic immigrants than among whites ; indeed , for some outcomes , increases are steeper for minority groups . Hispanic immigrants differ from other groups of women in being less likely to identify as something other than heterosexual or to have had sex with a same-sex partner ; their levels are lower , but their upward trends are typically sociological science | www.sociologicalscience.com 963 November 2016 | Volume 3 England , Mishel , and Caudillo Women's Increasing Bisexuality Figure 4 : Women's predicted probability of identifying as bisexual or gay , by birth cohort and race . not significantly different . The upward trends were also largely the same across socioeconomic background groups ( measured by mother's education ) . By contrast , there is no apparent trend in having only same-sex sexual partners , or partners of both sexes , for men . Nor is there an increase in the proportion of men who identify as gay or bisexual , or report such attraction . For the most part , these "" non-trends "" among men are not significantly different for whites than for blacks , U.S. - born Hispanics , or Hispanic immigrants , nor do they differ across groups of men defined by their mother's education . A limitation of our analysis is its inability to address how sexual experiences and identities that are not exclusively heterosexual evolve across the life cycle in recent cohorts among whom they are most common . The NSFG data include no one more than 45 years of age and contain only a limited range of cohorts . Because of this , for example , we were unable to see how many of the women in recent cohorts who had sex with both sexes in their early years continued to do so in their 30s , 40s , or later , or whether most of them transitioned to long-term relationships with either a man or a woman . We hope that future work will explore this . sociological science | www.sociologicalscience.com 964 November 2016 | Volume 3 England , Mishel , and Caudillo Women's Increasing Bisexuality Table 4 : Odds ratios from four logistic regressions predicting whether men ( 1 ) have had male and female sexual partners ( ever ) , ( 2 ) have had only male sexual partners ( ever ) , ( 3 ) identify as bisexual , and ( 4 ) identify as gay . 1 2 3 4 0.711 ( 0 . 143 ) 0.942 ( 0 . 254 ) 0.895 ( 0 . 287 ) 0.683 ( 0 . 262 ) 0.908 ( 0 . 413 ) 1.398 ( 0 . 707 ) 0.9 ( 0 . 353 ) 1.584 ( 0 . 799 ) 1.828 ( 1 . 002 ) 0.508 ∗ ( 0 . 161 ) 0.554 ( 0 . 220 ) 0.625 ( 0 . 271 ) 1.103 ( 0 . 232 ) 0.825 ( 0 . 128 ) 0.444 † ( 0 . 111 ) 0.589 ( 0 . 208 ) 0.756 ( 0 . 326 ) 1.556 ( 0 . 530 ) 0.538 ∗ ( 0 . 158 ) 2.207 ∗ ( 0 . 857 ) 0.526 ( 0 . 240 ) 0.797 ( 0 . 551 ) 0.97 ( 0 . 290 ) 0.829 ( 0 . 187 ) 1.297 ( 0 . 391 ) 0.337 ∗ ( 0 . 150 ) 1.926 ( 1 . 148 ) 1.225 ( 0 . 341 ) 0.809 ( 0 . 148 ) 1.065 ( 0 . 364 ) 0.735 ( 0 . 229 ) 0.615 ( 0 . 294 ) 1.095 ( 0 . 188 ) 1.092 ( 0 . 258 ) 15,242 2.562 † ( 0 . 867 ) 1.78 ( 0 . 677 ) 15,238 0.686 ( 0 . 199 ) 0.842 ( 0 . 283 ) 15,201 1.541 ( 0 . 342 ) 1.092 ( 0 . 304 ) 15,201 Cohort ( ref : 66 – 74 ) Born 75 – 79 Born 80 – 84 Born 85 – 95 Race ( ref : White ) Hispanic Black Other Immigrant Hispanic x Immigrant Mother's Education ( ref : < HS ) HS / Some College BA or more N † p < 0.01 ; ∗ p < 0.05 , two-tailed test . Standard errors in parentheses . Indicator variables for ages 18 – 45 were also included in all models , but odds ratios not shown . Another limitation of our analysis is that our data are not rich enough to allow us to test various possible explanations of the cohort trends that we find . What we can offer is a speculative explanation that comports with the central fact shown by our analysis – that movement away from exclusively heterosexual behavior and identity has occurred for women , not men . Our speculation is that two factors facilitated such change across cohorts of women : the gender revolution and increased acceptances of gay rights . One prominent message of the gender revolution was that it is all right for women to do things only men could previously do . This increased the sense that it was permissible for women to engage in sex with women , even though doing so is still a violation of traditional gender conformity . Increased tolerance for gay rights furthered the sense of permission . sociological science | www.sociologicalscience.com 965 November 2016 | Volume 3 England , Mishel , and Caudillo Women's Increasing Bisexuality Table 5 : Men's predicted probabilities .

None of the predicted probabilities for the last cohort is significantly higher than for the first cohort . 1 These predicted probabilities are from logistic regression models not shown , the same as those in Table 4 , but changing the dependent variable . One might have thought that the same two factors , greater acceptance of gay rights and greater acceptance of nonconforming gender expressions , would have furthered acceptance of men's same-sex relationships in a parallel fashion . Although some feminists urged an acceptance of men doing things seen as feminine and a revalorization of traditionally feminine activities , this was certainly not the message the average person received from the gender revolution , which mostly involved women changing by moving into traditionally male positions and styles . Thus , we speculate that the continued devaluation of the feminine , combined with the fact that same-sex relationships were still seen as gender-bending , meant that engaging in them entailed losing status for men more than it did for women . Therefore , women interested in sex with same-sex partners felt freer than men to engage in such behavior and even to identify as bisexual . Of course , some men and women have always expressed their same-sex desire , despite stigma , and we do not want to understate the social costs women still experience for departures from exclusive heterosexuality ( Mishel 2016 ) . Nonetheless , our conjecture is that changes in norms about gender and heterosexism intersected in a way that provided more of an opening for women than men to have same-sex sexual relations . Whether or not this is the correct explanation , we have shown that women have exhibited much more increase than men across cohorts in reported sex with same-sex partners and in bisexual identity . sociological science | www.sociologicalscience.com 966 November 2016 | Volume 3 England , Mishel , and Caudillo Women's Increasing Bisexuality Figure 5 : Men's predicted probability of having had sex with same-and other-sex partners , by birth cohort and race . Notes 1 We focus on the United States , but note that Johnson et al. ( 2001 : 1839 ) , studying the 1990s , found increases for British men and women in same-sex contact during the preceding five years . 2 Twenge et al. ( 2016 ) do state that most of the period change in having ever had a same-sex partner they document comes from individuals who have had sex with both sexes , but they do not show whether this is true for men and women separately . 3 Two qualitative studies in the United Kingdom also suggest , albeit indirectly , that ACASI would reduce under-reporting . Some gay or bisexual respondents reported to Betts ( 2009 ) that they would more likely reveal that they were not heterosexual if a survey used a method where neither the interviewer nor people in the household could hear or see their response . Similarly , some gay and bisexual participants in the study by Ellison and Gunstone ( 2009 ) said that they would reveal their sexual orientation in an online survey but would say they were heterosexual if asked by an interviewer . sociological science | www.sociologicalscience.com 967 November 2016 | Volume 3 England , Mishel , and Caudillo Women's Increasing Bisexuality Figure 6 : Men's predicted probability of identifying as bisexual or gay , by birth cohort and race . 4 By contrast , only 71 percent of women 18 – 45 years of age who called themselves bisexual report ever having had oral sex with a woman . Indeed , Brown and England ( 2016 ) found that 23 percent of bisexual women have never had sex with a woman ( 16 percent have had only male partners and 7 percent no partners of either sex ) . 5 The exact words used for the "" gay "" option varied by sex and year . In 2002 , the option was "" homosexual "" for both men and women . In 2006 and later , the "" gay "" option for women was "" homosexual , gay , or lesbian , "" while for men it was "" homosexual or gay . "" 6 There are no significant differences in cohort coefficients between whites and blacks , U.S. - born Hispanics , or Hispanic immigrants on sex with other and same-sex partners ever , sex with only same-sex partners ever , or bisexual identity . The only exception for the outcomes in Table 4 is that U.S. - born Hispanics had a significant increase in identifying as gay the last compared to first cohort ; no such increase was present for whites , and the differences between the two group's coefficients for the last cohort are significantly different . 7 This conclusion could be challenged under some assumptions about under-reporting . We might think that , due to the greater stigma for men than women of gay sex , men would under-report more . If the gender gap in under-reporting remained constant , but sociological science | www.sociologicalscience.com 968 November 2016 | Volume 3 England , Mishel , and Caudillo Women's Increasing Bisexuality men always under-reported more , then we might be overestimating the gender gap in behavior and identities , but our estimates of trends in behavior , although not levels , should be accurate . Another possibility is that women's under-reporting decreased , but their behavior did not change ; this could possibly yield an increase for women but not men like the one we observe .

1644,A16,"Victor Englebert / Photo Researchers Like hiking ? Then come and explore the plants and animals of seven of the world's major mountain ranges ! From the towering Himalayas to the austere Atlas Mountains , mountain ecosystems are chock full of interesting organisms . Often considered biological hotspots , many of these regions feature life forms with amazing adaptations to enable survival in rugged terrain and extreme weather conditions . Learn more about montane flora and fauna with this quick tour through a variety of mountains across the globe . Great Dividing Range Ron Dorman – Bruce Coleman Inc. A hike along Australia's Great Dividing Range would reveal a series of plateaus and low mountain ranges roughly paralleling the coasts of Queensland , New South Wales , and Victoria . The mountain range extends some 2,300 miles ( 3 , 700 km ) from the Cape York Peninsula , Queensland , to the Grampians in Victoria Bass Strait between Australia and Tasmania . In Queensland , the mountains average is 2,000 – 3 , 000 feet ( 600 – 900 meters ) in elevation , but they rise as high as 5,000 feet ( 1 , 500 meters ) in the Bellenden Ker and McPherson ranges and the Lamington Plateau . Farther south , a segment known as the Australian Alps , near the New South Wales – Victoria border , contains Australia's highest peak , Mount Kosciuszko ( 7 , 310 feet ) . Since the Great Dividing Range is not very high compared to other mountain ranges , few animals specifically adapted to mountainous environments occur there . Tree kangaroos and bird-wing butterflies occur in the rainforests of the mountainous northeast . Some bird species , such as the galah and the Australian magpie are found throughout Australia . Much of the Great Dividing Range is defined by forested areas of acacias , eucalyptus ( see photo ) , and casuarinas , with hummock grasses and flowering plants , including banksias , in the undergrowth . The vegetation on the western slopes is predominately subtropical or temperate woodlands of eucalyptus and scrub . The Wollemi pine is a "" living fossil "" that was discovered in Wollemi National Park in 1994 . Ethiopian Highlands Although Ethiopia's complex relief defies easy classification , of the five topographic regions in the country only two ( the Western Highlands and the Eastern Highlands ) might be classified as mountain ecosystems . The most spectacular portion is the North Central massifs in the Western Highlands ; these form the roof of Ethiopia , the highest being Mount Ras Dejen at 14,872 feet ( 4 , 533 meters ) . Lake Tana ( see photo ) – Ethiopia's largest inland lake and the main reservoir for the Blue Nile River – is located in this region , at an elevation of about 6,000 feet ( 1 , 800 meters ) . Another region , the Western Lowlands , are not what one would call low . They stretch north-south along the border with Sudan and South Sudan and include the lower valleys of the Blue Nile , Tekeze , and Baro rivers . With elevations of about 3,300 feet ( 1 , 000 meters ) , these "" lowlands "" are some of the hottest places on the planet . Several familiar African mammals live in Ethiopia , such as lions , leopards , elephants , giraffes , rhinoceroses , and wild buffalo , but these species rarely venture into the mountains . Uniquely Ethiopian mountain-dwelling species include the walia ibex of the Simien Mountains , the mountain nyala ( a kind of antelope ) , the Simien jackal , and the gelada monkey . These creatures are endangered , and they appear in both the Western and Eastern highlands in numbers ranging from a few hundred for the walia ibex to a few thousand for the others . The primary vegetation types of the Ethiopian Highlands are moorland , grassland , and herb meadow . While much of the region is predominantly grass and heathland , a number of other plants are also characteristic . Punctuating the landscape is the lovely Rosa abyssinica , an endemic rose bush that towers up to 6.5 feet ( 2 meters ) high . The kosso tree is used in traditional medicine as a vermifuge , and the wild African olive tree is found in many places throughout the range . One of the most unusual species is the giant lobelia , which reaches a height of 20 feet ( 6 meters ) when flowering . Himalayas Steven Powers / The Wildlife Collection For thousands of years the Himalayas have held a profound significance for the peoples of South Asia , as their literature , mythologies , and religions reflect . Since ancient times the vast glaciated heights have attracted the attention of the pilgrim mountaineers of India , who coined the Sanskrit name Himalaya – from hima ( "" snow "" ) and alaya ( "" abode "" ) – for this great mountain system . In contemporary times the Himalayas have offered the greatest attraction and the greatest challenge to mountaineers throughout the world . The Himalayas have more than 110 peaks rising to elevations of 24,000 feet ( 7 , 300 meters ) or more above sea level , including Kanchenjunga at the border of India ( Sikkim state ) and Nepal ( see photo ) . One of these peaks is Mount Everest ( Tibetan : Chomolungma ; Chinese : Qomolangma Feng ; Nepali : Sagarmatha ) , the world's highest , with an elevation of 29,035 feet ( 8 , 850 meters ) . The fauna of the eastern Himalayas is similar to that of the southern Chinese and Southeast Asian region . The animal life of the western Himalayas , however , have more in common with the Mediterranean , Ethiopian , and Turkmenian regions . Elephants and rhinoceroses are restricted to parts of the forested Tarai region – moist or marshy areas , now largely drained – at the base of the low hills in southern Nepal . Asiatic black bears , clouded leopards , langurs ( a long-tailed Asian monkey ) , and Himalayan goat antelopes ( e.g. , the tahr ) are some of the denizens of the Himalayan forests . In the foothills one may find the Indian rhinoceros , musk deer , and the Kashmir stag ( hangul ) , but in small numbers . In remote sections of the Himalayas , at higher elevations , snow leopards , brown bears , lesser pandas , and Tibetan yaks have limited populations . Above the tree line the most numerous animals , however , are diverse types of insects , spiders , and mites , which are the only animal forms that can live as high up as 20,700 feet ( 6 , 300 meters ) . The Himalayas are rich in floral biodiversity . On the western side of the range , the lower shrublands are defined by beautiful rhododendrons and meadows of grasses . In the eastern region , broadleaf forests receive almost 80 inches ( 200 centimeters ) of annual rainfall and feature indigenous oaks and maples with orchids and ferns in the understory . As one ascends the mountains , the temperate sub-alpine conifer forests dominate the landscape with pine , hemlock , spruce , and fir . The Himalayan balsam and other small , flowering plants can be found above the treeline in the alpine regions . Atlas Mountains Tom McHugh / Photo Researchers The Atlas system is a series of mountain ranges in northwestern Africa that run generally southwest to northeast across Morocco , Algeria , and Tunisia . They extend for more than 1,200 miles ( 2 , 000 kilometers ) from the Moroccan port of Agadir in the southwest to the Tunisian capital of Tunis in the northeast . Mount Toubkal at 13,665 feet ( 4 , 165 meters ) is the highest point in the Atlas Mountains . Other imposing peaks in the Atlas include Mount Tidirhine at 8,058 feet ( 2 , 456 meters ) , the rugged bastion of the Ouarsenis Massif ( which reaches a height of 6,512 feet ) , the Great Kabylie , which reaches 7,572 feet ( 2 , 308 meters ) at the peak of Lalla Khedidja , and Mount Chelia ( 7 , 638 feet ) . Much of the land in the Atlas has been cleared for agriculture , and a small fraction of the forest cover remains . Animal life in the mountains is also in retreat . There remain only a few jackals , a few tribes of monkeys ( Barbary macaques , the only African ape found north of the Sahara ) at higher elevations , and occasional herds of wild boars in the oak woods – found in the northern part of the range . With low rainfall and high rates of soil erosion , the Atlas Mountains are fairly sparsely vegetated . The areas with the highest rainfall feature moist forests of cork oaks with an undergrowth of arbutus ( cane apple ) and heather shrubs dotted with carpets of rockroses and lavender . Dry regions are populated with green oak and arborvitae ( a species of pine tree ) which form light , dry forests with a thin and bushy undergrowth . Stands of cedar dominate the higher altitudes , though the dry summits are often reduced to scattered stands of green oak and juniper trees . 1 Rocky Mountains Donnie Sexton / Travel Montana The Rocky Mountains are a massive cordillera made up of more than 100 separate mountain ranges stretching from Alberta and British Columbia to New Mexico . The spectacular vistas of the Rockies , such as St. Mary's Lake in Montana's Glacier National Park ( see photo ) , have inspired countless mountain climbers , explorers , and even songwriters ; John Denver wrote his famous anthem "" Rocky Mountain High "" about these uplands in 1972 . Among the large mammals emblematic of the rugged backcountry are the black bear , grizzly bear , mountain lion , and wolverine . Bighorn sheep and mountain goats inhabit the high crags in summer and migrate to the lower slopes for the winter months . Members of the deer family , such as the caribou , elk ( wapiti ) , mule deer , and white-tailed deer also migrate between alpine meadows and subalpine forests ; the solitary moose lumbers across northern lakes , streams , and marshy areas , feeding on willow foliage and aquatic plants . Wolves , brought to near extinction by human predation , remain rare but have resurged since 1970 as their importance in the wilderness ecosystem has come to be appreciated . Smaller mammals of the lower elevations include the least chipmunk , red squirrel , Columbian ground squirrel , black-footed ferret , and marmot . Far below the tree line , one can walk amongst beautiful forests dominated by ponderosa pines and quaking aspen . Ascend a bit higher and the forests change to subalpine spruces and firs that get progressively more gnarled and stunted with the increase in elevation . Above the tree line , one will find alpine meadows of small , herbaceous plants that are hardier than their appearance would have you believe . These include blue columbine , snow buttercup , and pink phlox . </doc>

1462,A14,"Forgiveness and Psychology Until the 1980s the theory and practice of forgiveness remained largely the province of the world's religious traditions . However during the last two decades of the 20th Century and into the 21st , the topic has attracted increasing interest within the field of Psychology . In 2006 , the American Psychological Association ( APA ) published a brochure summarizing examples of research on the topic of forgiveness . That the APA would publish such a brochure shows the degree to which forgiveness has gained traction as a meaningful topic for psychological research . In that brochure the APA offered a comprehensive definition of forgiveness ( adapted from a doctoral dissertation by C. Philpot , PhD from the University of Queensland in Australia . ) It reads as follows : Forgiveness is a process ( or the result of a process ) that involves a change in emotion and attitude regarding an offender . Most scholars view this an intentional and voluntary process , driven by a deliberate decision to forgive . This process results in decreased motivation to retaliate , and letting go of negative emotions toward the offender . Theorists differ in the extent to which they believe forgiveness also implies replacing the negative emotions with positive attitudes including compassion and benevolence . In any event , forgiveness occurs with the victim's full recognition that he or she deserved better treatment , one reason why Mahatma Gandhi contended that "" the weak can never forgive . Forgiveness is an attribute of the strong . "" ( For this quote with full references , see the APA brochure "" Forgiveness : A Sampling of Research Results , "" p. 5 . For further discussion of the definition of forgiveness and how it differs from categories such as morality , duty , justice , and reconciliation , see "" About Forgiveness "" by the International forgiveness Institute . A significant degree of the credit for the emergence of forgiveness as a mainstream concern of Psychology goes to three pioneers in the field . The first is Robert Enright , PhD , of the University of Wisconsin ( Madison ) and co-founder of the International Forgiveness Institute . Second is Everett Worthington , PhD , Virginia Commonwealth University ( VCU ) Professor of Psychology and head of both Fetzer Institute's "" Forgiveness Research Working Group "" and "" A Campaign for Forgiveness "" at The John Templeton Foundation . The third pioneer is Frederic Luskin , PhD , co-founder and Director of the Stanford Forgiveness Project and faculty member of the Institute for Transpersonal Psychology . Robert Enright Robert Enright is generally considered the father of forgiveness work within the field of Psychology . Enright took a huge professional risk turning his research to the topic of forgiveness . His colleagues at that time saw forgiveness as an inappropriate or weak research topic and suggested that he was foolish to focus on it . Fortunately Enright would not be dissuaded . Among his early forgiveness studies were those focusing on elderly women , love-deprived late adolescents , men whose partners had chosen abortion , and substance-dependent in-patients . He also developed the Enright Forgiveness Inventory , a psychometric instrument used in forgiveness research . Enright's work includes looking at what he calls the triad of forgiveness : forgiving , receiving forgiveness , and self-forgiveness . He suggests that greater clarity for the therapist utilizing a forgiveness intervention comes when all three aspects of the triad are kept in mind . Specifically with regard to forgiving , Enright has developed a four-phase intervention model , "" Processes of Forgiving Another . "" He calls his four phases uncovering , decision , work , and outcome . These four stages are further divided into a total of 20 discrete steps . ( Go to Baskin TW , and Enright RD , ( 2004 ) . Intervention Studies on Forgiveness : A Meta-Analysis . J Counseling & Development 83 ( 1 ) : 79-90 , page 80 , Table 1 for the details of Enright's model . ) In 2004 , together with Thomas Baskin , Enright published a watershed meta-analysis of forgiveness research studies to that date . The intent of their study was to compare different forgiveness interventions both for their effectiveness in increasing levels of forgiveness and for their impact on other mental health issues , such as depression and anxiety . Enright and Baskin analyzed the results from nine published articles , finding that the interventions therein fell into three distinct categories . The first they labeled decision-based . In this approach the interventions were individual and short term ( 1-6 sessions ) with the focus on the conscious , willful decision to forgive . They emphasized a cognitive therapeutic approach . The other two categories were described as process-based . They each entailed a sequence of stages as part of a gradual process leading eventually to forgiveness . In addition to cognitive elements , the process-based interventions also included affective and empathic components . Process-based interventions were further divided into two categories depending on whether the intervention was administered in a group setting ( 6-8 sessions ) or in individual therapy ( 12 to 60 sessions ) . Enright and Baskin found that the decision-based interventions showed little effect either for cultivating forgiveness or for related mental health benefits . However both the group and individual process-based interventions showed strong positive effects . Participants in group interventions did as well or better than 75 % of the control group with regard to development of forgiveness . Regarding other mental health constructs , 65 % equaled or outperformed those receiving no intervention . The comparable results for those receiving individual interventions were 95 % and 92 % respectively , exceptionally robust findings for psychological research , showing that individual process-based interventions were clearly the most effective . The authors suggest further study of the efficacy of process-based forgiveness interventions with clients suffering from mood and anxiety disorders where the etiology involves "" anger borne out of unfair treatment . "" ( For Baskin and Enright's article see Intervention Studies on Forgiveness : A Meta-Analysis . ) Everett Worthington Everett Worthington is the author , co-author or editor of several books on forgiveness . As co-author of To Forgive Is Human : How to Put Your Past in the Past ( 1997 ) , he had just completed the first draft when he found himself facing his own extraordinary personal test of forgiveness . Early on the morning of January 1 , 1996 , Dr. Worthington received a call from his brother who had just discovered the body of his brutally murdered mother on the floor of her Knoxville home . For a poignant written account of this event in his life , see "" Everett Worthington's Reach for Forgiveness . "" Dr. Worthington teaches courses on Positive Psychology and psychological measurement in addition to one entitled "" Forgiveness : Theory , Research , and Practice . "" He is also an expert on the interface between psychology and Christianity , his own personal faith . He has written extensively on the topics of forgiveness , marriage , and hope . His research focuses on these topics , but also expands them to include justice and social harmony . Dr. Worthington has developed what he calls "" The Pyramid Model to REACH Forgiveness . "" This process-based approach to the cultivation of forgiveness has six components described as follows : defining ( D ) forgiveness and comparing it with related concepts such as reconciliation , recalling ( R ) the hurt in a nonthreatening environment , building empathy ( E ) for the offender , encouraging an altruistic ( A ) response to the hurt based on experiences when the participants had themselves been forgiven , facilitating a commitment ( C ) to forgive the individual , and helping the participants maintain or hold ( H ) on to their forgiveness . ( Wade NG , Worthington E , and Haake S , ( 2009 ) Comparison of Explicit Forgiveness Interventions With an Alternative Treatment : A Randomized Clinical Trial . J Counseling & Development 87 ( 2 ) : 143-151 , p. 145 . ) Worthington's REACH model has been manualized into 20-hour and 6-hour group intervention protocols , each available for download free of cost in a secular or a Christian version . SEE VIDEO of Worthington describing the stages in his forgiveness process-based intervention . Frederic Luskin Frederic Luskin is a licensed Educational Psychologist , a Nationally-Certified School Psychologist and an MFT . He came to the study of forgiveness through the painful personal experience of being inexplicably betrayed and abandoned by a close friend and business associate during graduate school . As he puts it , "" I was badly hurt by a friend of mine and it threw my life upside down . "" Luskin found that he was simply unable to forgive . In the midst of this personal crisis and in the need of a dissertation topic , Luskin decided to see what he could learn by focusing his doctoral research on forgiveness . His choice of a dissertation on forgiveness eventually led him to the forefront of this emerging field within Psychology . Luskin gradually developed his own way of helping others forgive . According to him "" Forgiveness is a teachable skill ; you can learn it just the way you learn to play the piano . "" ( "" Forgiveness Boosts Health , "" Arthritis Today Magazine ) His approach , which he considers educational rather than psychotherapeutic , nonetheless incorporates elements of cognitive therapy along with mindfulness and Buddhist lovingkindness meditation . His forgiveness courses typically have once-a-week meetings , 60-90 minutes each , for 5-8 weeks . Elements of his approach are evident in his definition of forgiveness as follows : On his "" Forgive for Good "" website , Luskin offers the following list of nine steps in the forgiveness process as he teaches it . Luskin's teaching goals emphasize skills which go beyond the forgiving of a particular person and the offensive actions that have occurred . Rather he seeks to help people develop a lifestyle characterized by forgiveness . "" The essence of forgiveness "" he says "" is the ability to be resilient when things do n't go the way you want . "" This resilience is possible for us , as human beings , because "" we have been given the gift of the ability to make choices . "" Luskin describes four stages in coming to this kind of resilience . The first stage is when we are still caught in our angry responses to life's painful experiences . At the second stage , we 've begun to notice that responding with anger is painful and have taken concrete steps and made clear decisions towards forgiveness leading eventually to an actual experience of forgiveness . At stage three , having recognized , in our own experience , the positive benefits of forgiveness , we respond to future hurt by turning to forgiveness more quickly . We realize that how long we suffer from a painful experience is largely our choice . In the final stage , our ability to forgive is so deeply ingrained that we rarely take offense or get angry at the behavior of others . Rather our response , or choice , of forgiveness is automatic and immediate . Luskin's own research interests lie in measuring the impact of his manual-based , cognitive behavioral group interventions on such factors as the capacity for forgiveness , anger management , and hypertension . His work also looks at the differences regarding forgiveness between men and women and role of trait-based versus state-based anger .

Full text of this document is not available in this ePrints Service . Abstract In this issue of Oncogene , Serakinci et al show that adult stem cells can be targets for neoplastic transformation . After transducing human adult mesenchymal stem cells ( hMSC ) with the telomerase hTERT gene , and growing them for many population doublings in culture , Serakinci et al observed that the transduced cells developed characteristics consistent with transformation including loss of contact inhibition , anchorage independence and tumour formation in mice . Underlying these changes were alterations to genes involved in cell cycle regulation and senescence as well as oncogene activation . The importance of these observations is twofold . Firstly , showing that stem cells can become tumours raises a note of caution for stem cell therapeutics . Secondly , the findings lend support to the stem cell hypothesis of cancer development , and provide an experimental system in which the tantalizing hint of new diagnostic , prognostic , and therapeutic opportunities offered by this concept can be explored further . </doc>

1371,A16,"It 's Not Always Cold At Christmas Of course we know that for the Southern Hemisphere Christmas falls during their summer so turkey dinner on the beach each December 25th is a common occurrence . Heading up North and to western Europe in particular you 'd normally expect to witness plenty of those classic winter scenes at every turn ?

809,A16,"Bone Marrow and Stem Cell Transplants Bone marrow is a soft substance in our bones . It is the job of the bone marrow to make our blood . We have three types of blood cells . Red blood cells , white blood cells and platelet blood cells . It is the job of red blood cells to carry oxygen in the body , the white blood cells to protect our bodies from infection and the platelet blood cells to make our blood clot so that when we wound ourselves , the wound heals and we do not lose lots of blood . When these blood cells are at the earliest stage of development , they are called stem cells . A stem cell or bone marrow transplant provides healthy bone marrow to a patient to allow much higher doses of chemotherapy and improve the chances of curing the disease . When the cells are taken from the bone marrow we talk about bone marrow transplant and when cells are taken from the blood we talk about stem cell transplant . One type of transplant is using stem cells or bone marrow from a donor ( called allogeneic transplant ) . Another way is by using the patient's own stem cells or bone marrow . This is sometimes called an autologous transplant or an autograft , but strictly speaking it is not actually a transplant as this method does not use stem cells from someone else . It is therefore often rather called high dose treatment and stem cell support . When very high doses of chemotherapy are given , the treatment destroys the cells in the bone marrow . The doctors can take stem cells or bone marrow from the patient before they get the chemotherapy and then store the cells while the treatment is going on . This way , healthy cells from the patient are being protected while the strong treatment is destroying the cells that are left in the bone marrow . When the treatment is over , the healthy stem cells or bone marrow are given back to the patient and help them fight infection and cope with the strong treatment . With a proper transplant , the patient need another person ( a donor ) to give them healthy stem cells or bone marrow . </doc>

1501,A7,"To become an innovative manager , you must first recognize a critical axiom : Listening to customers should not solely be the role of call center agents . Listening to the customer should be an innovative manager's primary concern . Of course , this does n't mean sitting in a cubicle and fielding inbound calls under fluorescent lights . It means taking customer service to a deeper level , gathering data , analyzing trends , and responding accordingly . An innovative manager will strive to bring a focus on customer service to every level of the organization . You should make sure that the needs of customers should be understood by every employee , and every task , duty , and obligation should be initiated with these needs in mind . By aggressively focusing on customer needs , employees will eventually respond to them as if it were second nature . Think Long-Term Do n't fall into the same trap suffered by many public companies . The increasingly competitive global environment can force companies to re-engineer themselves , downsize , and cut costs at any corner . CEOs obsessed with golden parachutes and short term fluctuations in their stock prices can become extremely short-sighted . Unfortunately , customer service can be mistakenly seen as inconsequential to sales , and suffer as a result . This internal focus can lead corporations to become disconnected with their customers . Innovative managers recognize the importance of customer service and the value it adds in the long run . They realize that consistently nourishing customer relationships can substantially increase sales over time . The first step to seeing these improvements to fruition is to identify the ideal customer for your business . Ask them questions and attentively listen to their answers . The next step is to analyze their answers , determine their needs , and clearly define processes which will enable those needs to be met . You might be surprised to find that customers are more concerned with customer service and an overall comfort with your company , than the latest bells and whistles . The insights you can gain by actively listening to customers can go a long ways towards improving your brand , product , and ultimately , sales . If you give customers what they want , they will return the favor and give you what you want . American corporations have relied on a broad set of principles for over two hundred years . In today 's rapidly changing global environment , it 's time to rethink tradition and adopt modern set of principles . Companies that fail to adapt will fall by the wayside . Old World Order In the "" old world "" , American businesses set the standards by which global competitors had to follow . This is no longer the case . You must be prepared to think on your feet . The first step any successful manager or entrepreneur must take is to recognize and accept this truth . They must be able to quickly and flexibly move beyond every pre-conceived notion that may have been ingrained since childhood . They must be willing to move out of their respective comfort zones , and adopt entirely new business principles . An updated set of business processes must change the way companies buy , sell , and market goods and services . New processes will change the way you respond to and service customers . For all of its value , Adam Smith's division of labor theories do n't necessarily apply to today's world , and the ability to multi-task and multi-source is at a premium . The point is not to find quick fixes , simple tips , or practices . Incremental changes wo n't get you to where you need to be . Adaptation requires going back to square one and starting from scratch . To properly adjust to the global marketplace , entrepreneurs should n't just copy what everyone else is doing . Successful managers will find new and creative ways to highlight strengths and improve weaknesses . You must look beyond traditional processes and adopt new techniques . By making the appropriate adjustments , your company can dramatically improve performance , and zoom past your competitors . Corporate Navel Gazing You need to ask yourself the right questions when taking the first steps to restructuring and rethinking your business . If you truly want to innovate , do n't ask : "" How can we do this faster ? "" "" How can we cut costs ? "" While these are great questions , you must go even further back to gain clarity . Ask yourself : "" Why do customers choose us ? "" "" Why are we even in business at all ? "" You might find that you or your employees are spending a great deal of time completing functions that answer questions from set 1 rather than 2 . An innovative manager will refocus his or her efforts on providing excellent customer service , quality products , and satisfy customers . Refocusing your efforts wo n't be easy . There is no silver bullet . Taking the plunge is an all-or-nothing decision that must be faithfully adhered to . </doc>

362,A11,"Participants : Ronnie Irving , Ian Kinley , Derek McAlone and Dave Thexton General Comments This was essentially a repeat of a trip that three of us ( RI , IK and DT ) had made in October 2002 though an additional five days allowed us more time at each site and an opportunity to explore a new area ( the plains of southern Badajoz ) . Although the dates of the two trips overlapped , we noticed a number of differences ; in particular , in 2003 we saw plenty of Purple Herons and Hoopoes ( we had none in 2002 ) while Los Lances ( Tarifa Beach ) was drier and less productive in 2003 than in 2002 . There were many highlights in two bird-filled weeks but perhaps the abiding memory will be of a spectacular concentration of thousands of Glossy Ibis , storks , egrets , waders and gulls packed into one wet rice field at Isla Menor . It was also interesting to note the change in birds during the course of our trip - in the space of two weeks Meadow Pipits and Serins had gone from non-existent to common while swifts had disappeared . As last year we failed to find any rare swifts at Bolonia or Zahara , nor could we find any Little Bustards despite plenty of easily visible Great Bustards on the plains of southern Badajoz . We also repeated what is fast becoming a traditional fruitless search for Azure-winged Magpies in the horrendous Algaida Pinewoods ( they were , of course , all over the place north of Seville ) . Weather Quite mixed with some cool days and a fair amount of rain . Low cloud , rain and unfavourable winds at times hampered raptor migration at Tarifa , which proved less spectacular than in 2002 . About half the time however , conditions were ideal ; dry , sunny , calm and warm but never too hot to bird . Birding light lasted from about 08.15 ( no need for early starts ! ) to about 20.15 . Travel We flew from Liverpool to Malaga with EasyJet ( £ 100 return , booked over the internet , very efficient and virtually hassle-free ) . At Malaga airport , we picked up a hired Renault Scenic Diesel from Record Rentacar ( 342 euros , booked over the internet with Carjet and again very smooth and efficient ) . Accommodation We had not intended to pre-book any accommodation , having had no problems in 2002 , but prior to departure we learned that the European Kite Surfing Championships were being held in Tarifa during our time there so decided to book somewhere for the first few nights . We need not have worried ; it turned out to be no busier than usual , there is ample choice of accommodation in the area and we would have had no difficulty finding somewhere . However , we did have problems later in the trip - we had to move earlier than planned from our hotel in Fuente de Cantos as it was fully booked the next night ( a Saturday , frequently difficult for accommodation in our experience ) and , more seriously , we could not find any accommodation at all in , or near , Grazalema . Half a dozen hotels were all full and a radical change of itinerary saw us abandon our stay in the mountains and return to Tarifa . Anyone planning to visit the Grazalema area would be well advised to book in advance , at least at weekends , and be prepared for hordes of noisy tourists . We stayed at the following : - Hotel Cortija Las Pinas ( set back from the N340 8km west of Tarifa ) www . c ortijolaspinas . c om Four nights , 37 euros per night per twin-bedded apartment . Very comfortable ( though the lack of air-conditioning may be a problem in hotter periods ) and well situated . No proper restaurant but there was plenty nearby . Hostal Alcazar ( just east of Chipiona alongside road to Sanlucar de Barrameda ) Two nights ; 30 euros a night per twin-bedded room . Comfortable ( with air-conditioning ) and good value . Much better than outward appearances suggested . No restaurant but bar open in evenings and owner did get up specially to make us coffee at 07.30 . Hotel El Desembarco at Los Palacios y Villafranca Avenida de Cadiz , 4 . 41.720 Los Palacios . Sevilla . T el : 95 581 31 00 Fax : 95 581 23 23 . Two nights ; 35 euros per night per twin-bedded room . Very comfortable and excellent value . Good restaurant and bar . Sole drawback was difficulty with on-street parking ( we managed to pick up a parking ticket ! ) . Hotel Rural "" La Fabrica "" at Fuente de Cantos http://www.hrlafabrica.com or e-mail hotel @ hrlafabrica . c om Two nights ; 55 euros per night per twin-bedded room . Very nice indeed if a touch pricey ( though not by British standards ) . Good restaurant . Excellent location with Great Bustards , Black Vultures and Black-bellied Sandgrouse just five minutes drive away and Black-shouldered Kites within 15km . Hostal El Pilar at Monesterio One night ; 36 euros a night per twin-bedded room . Comfortable and good value but a lot of traffic noise . Very good bar / restaurant just across the road under same ownership . The restaurant menu included some interesting English translations such as "" scum "" which turned out to be ice cream and "" thorns to the brave sauce "" which remained unidentified , as none of us was brave enough to order it ! Hotel Cordoniz ( alongside N340 just west of Tarifa ) La Codorniz , Carretera Nacional 340 - Km . 79 , 11380 TARIFA ( Cadiz ) http://www.lacodorniz.com Tel ( 34 ) 956 684744 Fax : ( 34 ) 956 684101 Two nights ; 70 euros per night per twin-bedded bungalow apartment including , unusually , continental breakfast ( served from 08.00 , allowing just enough time before it got light enough to bird ) . Superb , very comfortable , excellent restaurant and brilliant location . Easily the best place we stayed but reflected in the price . Itinerary October 1st : Malaga-Tarifa , with most of our half-day's birding at or near Tarifa . October 2nd-4th : Based at Tarifa with birding done in Tarifa area , La Janda and Sierra de la Plata . October 5th : Tarifa-Bonanza . Birding at Bonanza Salinas and Laguna de Tarelo . October 6th : Birding at Trebujena Marismas , Algaida Salinas and Bonanza Salinas . October 7th-8th : Based at Los Palacios y Villafranca birding sites on the east bank of the Guadalquivir ( Brazo del Este / Isla Menor ) . October 9th : Los Palacios y Villafranca-Fuente de Cantos birding en route and , in evening , in the Fuente de Cantos area . October 10th-11th : Fuente de Cantos area including Sierra de Hornachos . Overnight at Monesterio on 11th . October 12th : Monesterio-Isla Menor . Full morning's birding at Isla Menor before travelling to Grazalema . Failed to find accommodation and continued on to Tarifa . October 13th-14th : Birding in Tarifa area before travelling to Malaga late morning on 14th . Sites Visited : Los Lances ( Tarifa Beach ) Superb site that we accessed from several points between the harbour and the football stadium c2km to the north . Rather drier ( especially on our second visit ) than in 2002 with gulls and terns less obliging but different birds every day and well worth repeated visits . We found seawatching better from the beach near the football stadium and / or the causeway to the island than from the coast on the Mediterranean side of the fort , with birds closer and more numerous ( though you do lose the advantage of height ) . The dunes and rough grassy areas behind the beach were also well worth exploring . Lots of potential for a major "" find "" here . We also paid several visits to the inlet behind Playa Palomas , which is essentially an extension of Los Lances about 8km north of Tarifa . Though heavily disturbed by surfers , it did have an interesting tidal inlet with potential for good birds . Ciguena Negra watchpoint , Tarifa We did our raptor watching from here ( which we called Tarifa Observatory in our 2002 report ) . It 's the first viewpoint east of Tarifa ( take the first minor track left off the main road near the top of the hill going east out of Tarifa in the direction of an ugly-looking Cepsa compound / building ) . The small concrete observatory structure ( now sporting a nice drawing or two Black Storks on the wall ) is situated on a low foothill overlooking the town and coastal strip and affords some protection from the sun and wind . It is manned at times by locals monitoring the raptor and stork migration La Janda ( pictured right ) Excellent plains area , with reedy drainage ditches and rice fields , plenty of potential . Very drivable tracks , with no apparent access problems , at an elevated level to the surrounding fields . Huge numbers of White Storks assembling close to the tracks with raptors constantly in view overhead . Sierra de la Plata Area of low coastal limestone hills , not brilliant overall though well known for breeding White-rumped and Little Swifts . Bonanza Salinas Superb site with no access problems ( contrary to Gosney ) . Large concentrations of birds with a network of drivable tracks allowing very close views . Algaida Salinas Another excellent area . Again there are now no access problems ( see Gosney ) . An extension of the above site with similar birds though the generally deeper water resulted in a subtle difference in the species using the area . Trebujena Marismas An interesting area of farmland , marismas and lagoons situated between Trebujena and the Guadalquivir north of Algaida . We saw our only Pin-tailed Sandgrouse here . Laguna de Tarelo Good access and viewing , with easy White-headed Ducks . Algaida Pinewoods We again failed to see the promised Azure-winged Magpies here in two visits . Not an enjoyable area to bird due to local "" boy racers "" on motorbikes and inconsiderate 4xwheel drive owners haring along the rough track . May be more productive when quiet . Brazo del Este / Isla Menor Superb site that includes the area Gosney refers to as the Pinzon Marshes . Close range viewing mostly from a road level higher than the surrounding habitat gives wonderful views of the full range of marisma species . A must visit site , which , with reports of accessible areas of the Coto Donana being dry at the time of our trip , appears to have more reliable water levels than the Coto itself . In fact , water levels at Brazo del Este were considerable higher than in 2002 with no muddy margins for the Bluethroats or waders seen last year . However , more than adequate compensation was provided by the rice fields at Isla Menor where harvesting was underway and conditions were perfect for feeding waterbirds . Water levels are likely to change constantly - indeed they had done so between our two visits - and it 's a case of driving the network of tracks to find where the birds are concentrated . Make sure you continue beyond the Acebuche Bar onto the tracks towards San Vicente Ferrier - we found this the most productive area on our visit . Plains of southern Badajoz We birded the triangle formed by Fuente de Cantos , Llerena and Usagre but concentrated most on the area east of Fuente de Cantos where we were based and found it excellent for Great Bustards and Black-bellied Sandgrouse though we saw neither Little Bustards nor Pin-tailed Sandgrouse here . It was also pretty good for raptors with Black-shouldered Kite , Bonelli's Eagle , Golden Eagle , Black Vulture , Hen Harrier and lots of Red Kites . Sierra de Hornachos Disappointing with far fewer raptors on show than the literature had led us to believe . For details and directions to all the sites we visited we used : - Gosney's Finding Birds in Southern Spain . Though in most cases the directions and maps were up to the usual high standard , woefully out of date in places , especially re Bonanza and Algaida Salinas . Also in the section on Brazo del Este he regularly refers to Isla Major when he means Isla Menor . No updates were available on the Birdguides website prior to our trip . Where to watch birds in Southern and Western Spain by Garcia and Patterson . Excellent and up to date , with much useful background information . Birdwatching on Spain's Southern Coast by John R. Butler . See also his website at www . d onanabirdtours . c om which gives some site information and includes up-to-date trip reports from the Donana area . Useful extra information was gleaned from trip reports available on the Birdtours website www . b irdtours . c o . u k / tripreports and we also looked at the Rare Birds in Spain website www . r arebirdspain . n et prior to our trip for info on latest rarities . We used the Michelin map 446 Espagne Sud Species List We recorded a total of 180 species , listed below . The figures in brackets represent the number of days each species was recorded e . g . ( 4 / 14 ) means that a species was seen on four days during our 14 day trip ( bearing in mind that the first and last days were really only half-days of birding ) and gives a crude indication of how easy each species was to see . More details are given of the rarer or more interesting species . Little Grebe Tachybaptus ruficollis ( 5 / 14 ) Records included 200 + at Trebujena Marismas on 6th Great Crested Grebe Podiceps cristatus ( 5 / 14 ) Black-necked Grebe Podiceps nigricollis ( 1 / 14 ) - 1 at Trebujena Marismas on 6th Cory's Shearwater Calonectris diomedea ( 7 / 14 ) - Ever present off Los Lances often very close inshore , max . 100 on 14th . Also seen close in at Bolonia and Zahara de los Atunes . Balearic Shearwater Puffinus mauretanicus ( 5 / 14 ) - Birds seen heading into the Mediterranean every day off Los Lances with a maximum count of 50 ( including 33 in 30 minutes ) on 4th .

982,A8,"As Japan , the United States and South Korea meet in Tokyo to discuss setting up a second round of international talks on halting North Korea's nuclear weapons development , Pyongyang warns that it is already taking steps to increase it nuclear capabilities . North Korea is once again saying that it has no interest in further rounds of six-party talks on its nuclear program , echoing comments made following the first such round , which was held in Beijing in August and ended without concrete progress . The north also says it is boosting its nuclear capabilities as a deterrent against a possible attack by the United States . For weeks , Pyongyang , through its Korean Central News Agency , has threatened to beef up nuclear weapons development to ward off a possible U.S. strike . A spokesman of the North Korean Foreign Ministry said that if Washington pushed the north to give up its nuclear weapons program before guaranteeing the isolated Stalinist state's security , it could lead to war . The South Korean and American governments see such comments as a typical North Korean negotiating tactic . Pyongyang also called again for a non-aggression treaty from the United States before it responds to international concerns about its nuclear program , a request Washington has repeatedly rejected . The United States insists the north must scrap its weapons programs first , but has also said it has no plans to attack it . The north's latest commentary comes as the Bush administration's top negotiator on North Korea , Assistant Secretary of State James Kelly , met for a second day with officials from Japan and South Korea in Tokyo to discuss preparations for a new round of six-country talks involving China , Russia , the two Koreas , Japan and the United States . James Kelly "" > James Kelly The talks were held behind closed doors at a Tokyo hotel and officials did not comment on the meeting's content . Noriyuki Suzuki , a Japan-based North Korea expert , says he has high hopes for the six-party process and noted that all participants agreed to work on solving the conflict peacefully . He added that he is confident that the negotiation process will eventually halt North Korea's nuclear activities . Also Tuesday , the United States and South Korea commemorated the 50th anniversary of their Mutual Defense Treaty , under which Washington stations 37,000 U.S. troops in South Korea to help protect it in case the North launches an attack . The American ambassador to South Korea , Thomas Hubbard , said in a speech in Seoul on Tuesday that the United States and South Korea must continue to be vigilant in the face of the North Korean security threat .

785,A14,"Dr Hamid Dehghani "" Dr Julian Moger "" "" Full table of contents Biophysics of the Extracellular Matrix The extracellular matrix is a component of all mammalian tissues and consists of a network of fibrous proteins , elastin and collagens , embedded in a viscoelastic gel rich in high molecular weight anionic polymers known as proteoglycans . This structure , which is quantitatively a major component in tissues such as cartilage , intervertebral disc and blood vessels , endows tissues with the requisite mechanical properties and regulates the movement of water , nutrients and other solutes . There is strong evidence that changes in these functions are associated with diseases as apparently diverse as arthritis , atherosclerosis and cancer . There is a delicate symbiosis between the behaviour of the cells , whose functions include the repair and remodelling of the extracellular matrix , and the composition of the matrix itself . This interaction , which is mediated by a wide variety of electrical , mechanical and chemical signals , is only slowly becoming understood but it underlies the normal processes of development and growth and may be impaired in disease . Our research has the long-term aim of unravelling the relationships between the physical properties of the macromolecular constituents of the extracellular matrix and their supramolecular assemblies and the physiological functions of the tissue . This information is , we believe , important in relating the wealth of descriptive data that has accumulated on changes in extracellular matrix biochemistry that occur in disease to the actual disease process . Current projects include : Analysis of the molecular mechanisms of elasticity in elastic proteins . Characterisation of the organisation of Type IV collagen in the basement membrane and the changes that occur in diabetes . Investigation of the structure and permeability to nutrients of the bone-cartilage interface in normal tissues , osteoporosis and arthritis . Ultrastructural analysis of the stress and strain distribution in bone and cartilage under mechanical loads . Investigation of the effects of ionising radiation on the physical properties of extracellular matrix macromolecules . In this work we employ techniques such as Raman microspectrometry to characterise molecular composition and conformation , small and large angle X-ray diffraction , utilising synchrotron sources , to characterise intra - and supra-molecular organisation and X-ray fluorescence for material characterisation , as well as a number of more specialised techniques , some of which are described in the Biomedical Optics </doc>

840,A17,"Recorder players are most likely to be familiar with Robin Walker's A Book of Song and Dance ( both the edition published by Forsyth Brothers and a recording of the collection have been reviewed in The Recorder Magazine ) pieces from which have been included in grade exam syllabuses . This CD provides an opportunity to hear two more of Walker's recorder pieces together with a selection of other instrumental works composed during the last twenty years . Mr Gilbert dines at the Modern Hindu Hotel for descant recorder and piano was composed in 1994 to celebrate composer Anthony Gilbert's 60th birthday . Lasting a little under three minutes and certainly an occasional piece , it is nevertheless a significant work , exploring textures and sonorities found also in Rite in A Book of Song and Dance composed at around the same time . His Master's Voice for sopranino recorder and piano was written in 2001 for Walker's composition teacher David Lumsdain on his 70th birthday . It proceeds in alternate calm and energetic sections that achieve further contrast by setting the recorder very effectively against the piano's higher and lower registers . This and the above are two recorder works striking in their originality that leave you eager to hear more of walker's work for the instrument . His years as a chorister in York Minster under the direction of Francis Jackson clearly gave Walker a strong sense of organ sonorities that is very evident in two impressive works for the instrument , Dances with Chant and Chorales and Invention . The earliest composition on the disc is Dance / Still for the unusual ensemble of flute , clarinet , violin , cello , guitar and percussion ( two players ) written in 1982 . Here , the influence on Walker of his study-visits to India is particularly evident in the rhythmic freedom and expressiveness . The piano piece At the Grave of William Baines was written for the centenary of the Yorkshire composer ( 1899-1922 ) . Lasting nearly fifteen minutes , it captures something of the spirit of Baines' own works for piano , but also reflects Walker's own response to the instrument . In total contrast is the work for pianola , Halifax . The composer describes it as a mechanical fantasy , and as the piece progresses , an almost musical box-like quality takes over from and contrasts with the heavier almost mill-like sounds of the opening . The most personal work on the disc is the short , single movement string quartet , I Thirst , from 1994 . Walker reflects on one of Christ's Seven Last Words in a work of extraordinary atmosphere , beginning and punctuated with viola solos and making use of chords in quiet harmonics for the entire quartet . The performances by all involved are impressive . Walker's music engages the performer ( and the listener ) and is clearly born out of inspiration rather than formulation . This is something in which Walker believes passionately and about which he has written in his contribution in the symposium Reviving the Muse , ( edited by Peter Davison and published by Claridge Press ) . A disc revealing a very original musical personality who composes for the recorder with the same creativity he brings to all his instrumental works - Andrew Mayes Review by Roger Carpenter in The British Music Society In an age when so much - too much - new music is hardly more than soulless note-spinning striving for effect , Robin Walker stands apart , a classicist at heart , who writes from the heart in a wholly contemporary idiom , at once distinctive and attractive ; in short , he is that modern rara avis , a composer whose music leaves you wanting to hear more . This impeccably produced , performed and recorded disc presents a conspectus of his developing work over two decades , ever subject to experiment and expansion into new fields , ranging from Dance / Still , the chamber piece which first brought him to public notice , to the neatly titled His Master's Voice , a 70th birthday tribute to his composition teacher , David Lumsdaine . One could say that Walker is Robert Simpson's natural successor in his command of large organic structure juxtaposing vitality with stasis in the true sense of both words . Like Roussel , following two study visits to India he has drawn inspiration , particularly rhythmically , from the culture of that continent , and overall one senses a French provenance ( or as the composer himself puts it , a precession ) , matching the timeless strength of Varèse , Messiaen and , to my ears particularly , Koechlin . Remarkably Robin himself is not familiar with Koechlin , yet he aspires to the same fusion of energy and stillness ; listen to the opening of the second part of Dance / Still - for a moment , it could almost be from Le livre de la jongle . This comes across again awesomely in the organ work , Dances with Chant and Chorales , filtered through the prism of childhood recollection as a York Minster chorister of the grandeur of the Minster organ's Full Swell , and equally in the string quartet , I Thirst , with its clouds of natural harmonics . A further organ piece , Invention , takes as its starting point a very different French idiom , that of the virtuoso tradition of Dupré et al , not to mention Walker's first and much revered teacher at the Minster , Francis Jackson , whilst Halifax , written by contrast unusually and most effectively for the pianola , reveals an unexpected vein of Yorkshire humour beneath its celebration of a native heritage . Living as he now does just across the Pennines in Lancashire , it is no surprise that Walker has responded to another more recent virtuoso tradition , that established by the Manchester-based recorder player , John Turner , for whom he has written ten pieces ; two of these , stunningly played , are included on this CD . Readers of British Music volume 21 may recall Robin's account of how he grew up on the very road in York in which William Baines had lived and died at the age of 23 some thirty-odd years before . The spiritual affinity between these two composers of different eras goes far deeper than that simple coincidence , and the extended piano work , At the Grave of William Baines , is a direct response to a pilgrimage made to the grave on the 100th anniversary of Baines's birth . There is no superficial homage here replete with quotations - this is pure Robin Walker , albeit infused throughout with Baines's spirit , and the emotion is intense , filled with frustration , and ultimately resignation , at the waste of creative instincts thwarted by ill health . It is played magnificently by Peter Lawson . David Fanning calls Walker's half-hour symphonic poem The Stone Maker "" one of the outstanding achievements in British music of the 1990s "" , and , objectively setting aside my own Bainesian associations , I can not but think that the same applies to this piano work , at least as significant in the context of 1999 as was the impact of Baines's own Paradise Gardens exactly eighty years previously . Where next ? There are hopes of a recording of Walker's 40-part madrigal , recently broadcast by the Tallis Scholars on BBC Radio 3 , and meanwhile the world of opera beckons .

1229,A12,"Provide local mental health care for my daughter . My daughter Rachael just turned 15 . Growing up she has always been a very loving , cheeky young lady with a great sense of humour and an amazing ability to make everybody laugh . Unfortunately when she was 13 she developed severe depression and has been suffering ever since . At a time when she needed her family around her the most , was moved to a specialist unit on the other side of the country . She is now in a medium secure unit 153 miles from home . As her mother it has been unbearable to have Rachael so far away from our family , who live in Lancashire . I can only visit once every two weeks , for 2 hours maximum -- my other children see their sister even less . It costs £ 200 every time for me , my husband and my children to visit her . I ca n't afford to see her anymore and I am unable to be with my child when she needs me the most . Rachael often calls me up and begs me to visit her . I know this distance is hurting her recovery . Young people's mental health care has been overlooked in this country for far too long and thousands of families like mine are being neglected . In Lancashire , particularly , I know people are n't getting the treatment they deserve . Even our MP , Lindsay Hoyle , has said the care in our area is "" simply inadequate "" . Something needs to change and high quality local care for Rachael could be the first step . Petitions have helped other families in similar situations . When Phill Wills started his # BringJoshHome campaign to get care for his son , his local authorities started to listen . Public pressure can do the same for us . Please join me in calling on Lancashire NHS Trust to localise Rachael's care and get her treatment closer to us . Please , bring my daughter home . Thank you . </doc>

912,A4,"While she still sat under the Scotchman's eyes a man came up to the door , reaching it as Henchard opened the door of the inner office to admit Elizabeth . The newcomer stepped forward like the quicker cripple at Bethesda , and entered in her stead . She could hear his words to Henchard : "" Joshua Jopp , sir – by appointment – the new manager . "" "" The new manager ! – he 's in his office , "" said Henchard bluntly . "" In his office ! "" said the man , with a stultified air . "" I mentioned Thursday , "" said Henchard ; "" and as you did not keep your appointment , I have engaged another manager . At first I thought he must be you . Do you think I can wait when business is in question ? "" "" You said Thursday or Saturday , sir , "" said the newcomer , pulling out a letter . "" Well , you are too late , "" said the corn-factor . "" I can say no more . "" "" You as good as engaged me , "" murmured the man . "" Subject to an interview , "" said Henchard . "" I am sorry for you – very sorry indeed . But it ca n't be helped . "" There was no more to be said , and the man came out , encountering Elizabeth-Jane in his passage . She could see that his mouth twitched with anger , and that bitter disappointment was written in his face everywhere . Elizabeth-Jane now entered , and stood before the master of the premises . His dark pupils – which always seemed to have a red spark of light in them , though this could hardly be a physical fact – turned indifferently round under his dark brows until they rested on her figure . "" Now then , what is it , my young woman ? "" he said blandly . "" Can I speak to you – not on business , sir ? "" said she . "" Yes – I suppose . "" He looked at her more thoughtfully . "" I am sent to tell you , sir , "" she innocently went on , "" that a distant relative of yours by marriage , Susan Newson , a sailor's widow , is in the town , and to ask whether you would wish to see her . "" The rich rouge-et-noir of his countenance underwent a slight change . "" Oh – Susan is – still alive ? "" he asked with difficulty . "" Yes , sir . "" "" Are you her daughter ? "" "" Yes , sir – her only daughter . "" "" What – do you call yourself – your Christian name ? "" "" Elizabeth-Jane , sir . "" "" Newson ? "" "" Elizabeth-Jane Newson . "" This at once suggested to Henchard that the transaction of his early married life at Weydon Fair was unrecorded in the family history . It was more than he could have expected . His wife had behaved kindly to him in return for his unkindness , and had never proclaimed her wrong to her child or to the world . "" I am – a good deal interested in your news , "" he said . "" And as this is not a matter of business , but pleasure , suppose we go indoors . "" It was with a gentle delicacy of manner , surprising to Elizabeth , that he showed her out of the office and through the outer room , where Donald Farfrae was overhauling bins and samples with the inquiring inspection of a beginner in charge . Henchard preceded her through the door in the wall to the suddenly changed scene of the garden and flowers , and onward into the house . The dining-room to which he introduced her still exhibited the remnants of the lavish breakfast laid for Farfrae . It was furnished to profusion with heavy mahogany furniture of the deepest red-Spanish hues . Pembroke tables , with leaves hanging so low that they well-nigh touched the floor , stood against the walls on legs and feet shaped like those of an elephant , and on one lay three huge folio volumes – a Family Bible , a "" Josephus , "" and a "" Whole Duty of Man . "" In the chimney corner was a fire-grate with a fluted semicircular back , having urns and festoons cast in relief thereon , and the chairs were of the kind which , since that day , has cast lustre upon the names of Chippendale and Sheraton , though , in point of fact , their patterns may have been such as those illustrious carpenters never saw or heard of . "" Sit down – Elizabeth-Jane – sit down , "" he said , with a shake in his voice as he uttered her name , and sitting down himself he allowed his hands to hang between his knees while he looked upon the carpet . "" Your mother , then , is quite well ? "" "" She is rather worn out , sir , with travelling . "" "" A sailor's widow – when did he die ? "" "" Father was lost last spring . "" Henchard winced at the word "" father , "" thus applied . "" Do you and she come from abroad – America or Australia ? "" he asked . "" No. We have been in England some years . I was twelve when we came here from Canada . "" "" Ah ; exactly . "" By such conversation he discovered the circumstances which had enveloped his wife and her child in such total obscurity that he had long ago believed them to be in their graves . These things being clear , he returned to the present . "" And where is your mother staying ? "" "" At the Three Mariners . "" "" And you are her daughter Elizabeth-Jane ? "" repeated Henchard . He arose , came close to her , and glanced in her face . "" I think , "" he said , suddenly turning away with a wet eye , "" you shall take a note from me to your mother . I should like to see her – She is not left very well off by her late husband ? "" His eye fell on Elizabeth's clothes , which , though a respectable suit of black , and her very best , were decidedly old-fashioned even to Casterbridge eyes . "" Not very well , "" she said , glad that he had divined this without her being obliged to express it . He sat down at the table and wrote a few lines , next taking from his pocket-book a five-pound note , which he put in the envelope with the letter , adding to it , as by an afterthought , five shillings . Sealing the whole up carefully , he directed it to "" Mrs. Newson , Three Mariners Inn , "" and handed the packet to Elizabeth . "" Deliver it to her personally , please , "" said Henchard . "" Well , I am glad to see you here , Elizabeth-Jane – very glad . We must have a long talk together – but not just now . "" He took her hand at parting , and held it so warmly that she , who had known so little friendship , was much affected , and tears rose to her aerial-grey eyes . The instant that she was gone Henchard's state showed itself more distinctly ; having shut the door he sat in his dining-room stiffly erect , gazing at the opposite wall as if he read his history there . "" Begad ! "" he suddenly exclaimed , jumping up . "" I did n't think of that . Perhaps these are impostors – and Susan and the child dead after all ! "" However , a something in Elizabeth-Jane soon assured him that , as regarded her , at least , there could be little doubt . And a few hours would settle the question of her mother's identity ; for he had arranged in his note to see her that evening . "" It never rains but it pours ! "" said Henchard . His keenly excited interest in his new friend the Scotchman was now eclipsed by this event , and Donald Farfrae saw so little of him during the rest of the day that he wondered at the suddenness of his employer's moods . In the meantime Elizabeth had reached the inn . Her mother , instead of taking the note with the curiosity of a poor woman expecting assistance , was much moved at sight of it . She did not read it at once , asking Elizabeth to describe her reception , and the very words Mr. Henchard used . Elizabeth's back was turned when her mother opened the letter . It ran thus : – Meet me at eight o ' clock this evening , if you can , at the Ring on the Budmouth road . The place is easy to find . I can say no more now . The news upsets me almost . The girl seems to be in ignorance . Keep her so till I have seen you . M. H. He said nothing about the enclosure of five guineas . The amount was significant ; it may tacitly have said to her that he bought her back again . She waited restlessly for the close of the day , telling Elizabeth-Jane that she was invited to see Mr. Henchard ; that she would go alone . But she said nothing to show that the place of meeting was not at his house , nor did she hand the note to Elizabeth . </doc>

1388,A7,"Can I Test Drive a Car ? Buying a car is a big decision for any motorist , so they should explore all of the different ways of deciding whether a car is right for them and their family . It is important for a motorist to explore a car's features , capabilities and drive experience , which can be difficult to do effectively if confined to a show-room or shopping online , which may be unsafe to shop online for a car . Many dealerships or private individuals may offer a test-drive , and there is usually no harm in asking . When considering different cars for purchase , a motorist should telephone the different dealerships to see if a test-drive can be arranged . In addition , some online car dealerships can also offer test-drives which can be booked online . Motorists should remember that if the purchase a car they will have to live with it , so they are advised not to base the purchase too heavily on the car's superficial characteristics . In addition , the customer should remember that the salesperson will always be looking for a sale , and should receive their information with this in mind . The Driving Experience When taking a test-drive , it is a good idea to have researched the model heavily so that the motorist can see if the car's driving experience lives up to the manufacturer's claims . The test-drive should be booked in for a time when the customer is not under pressure , meaning that they can fully concentrate on the driving experience . This is also useful to give he customer plenty of time to fully test the car's features . For example , it is a good idea to test the car within a variety of situations , such as motorways or suburban travel . This is can enable the driver to get a measure of the car's versatility and the extent to which it ill fit their usage , such as heavy motorway travel for someone who commutes . It is , however , important for the customer to run their planned route by the salesperson before deviating from the regular test-drive route . The motorist may also be concerned by the quality of the car's interior , which can sometimes be forgotten if they are concentrating on the road . One should explore its functionality , such as adjustable seats , leg-room , how easy the skylight is to operate etc. . The customer should not be afraid to try everything to determine how durable and user-friendly it is . For this task it is often useful to bring a passenger for the ride . Passengers can take in extra details which the driver may miss , and can account for the quality of the car's ride while sitting it the back . If the motorist is comparing different vehicles , it is important for them to give themselves the best chance of finding the best one . This can be achieved by test driving the cars in as quick a succession as possible , to compare the features most closely . If one can arrange to test more than one car in a day , this will provide a very effective comparison . If the motorist feels that the need another driver to further test the car's specification , dealerships will usually be pleased to facilitate this as they feel that they may be close to a sale . Overall , buying a new car carries a lot of responsibility , such as car insurance comparisons . Very little can be gained by rushing this process , so the motorist should use every opportunity to test the car's quality and capabilities . The driver , if they require some more information , should remember that their dealership usually be pleased to facilitate a second test-drive , as they imagine it will get them closer to a sale , there can never be any harm in telephoning to ask . </doc>

FIDEL CASTRO RUZ , FIRST SECRETARY OF THE REPUBLIC OF CUBA , IN RESPONSE TO STATEMENTS MADE I have the honour to forward herewith the text of the statement made on 10 May 2002 by Fidel Castro Ruz , First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Cuba and President of the Councils of State and of Ministers of the Republic of Cuba , in response to statements made on 6 May 2002 by John Bolton , Under-Secretary of State of the United States of America . I should be grateful if you could arrange to have the enclosed text circulated as an official document of the Conference on Disarmament . ( Signed ) : Iván Mora Godoy Ambassador Permanent Representative "" There will always be weapons more powerful than those obtained through technology : the weapons of morality , reason and ideas "" Response by Commander-in-Chief Fidel Castro Ruz , First-Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Cuba and President of the Councils of State and of Ministers , to statements made by the United States Government concerning biological weapons on 10 May 2002 , "" Year of the Heroic Prisoners of the Imperialists "" A mere three days ago , Otto Reich , Assistant Secretary of State , a person only too well known to us , was unmasked in an embarrassing lie when he said that four Cuban planes had landed in the Venezuelan capital on 12 April and : "" What they were doing there , what they were carrying , we do n't know . "" This was , it transpires , the beginning of an anti-Cuban campaign or an act of vengeance for the extraordinary debacle of the fascist coup which he had orchestrated , or both . When challenged publicly by the Cuban Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Tuesday , 7 May , the State Department said that it had no firm information , and did not wish to discuss the matter any further . The idea of destroying Cuba , an obsession which has lasted more than 43 years , has led and continues to lead United States policy down a tortuous path of lies , fiascos and blunders . The discrepancy between what the United States Government is telling the world today and what it is actually doing with Cuba represents the most egregious and demoralizing contradiction of its foreign policy . Never before has this super-Power found itself in such a compromising situation , which has left it no choice but to lie , lie and lie again . There is no shortage of unscrupulous characters in high public office prepared to do this , or of press spokesmen painfully contorting themselves to disavow the wrongdoings of their superiors and to explain the inexplicable in their statements . Even a man like Colin Powell , the son of Jamaican immigrants , who , notwithstanding his military training - or perhaps because of it - is not considered to be a warmonger since he knows war and has seen men die , a man whom many Americans have come to look on as a potential presidential candidate , has found himself embroiled by these characters in squalid machinations that do him little credit . He better than anyone else knows how inexperienced they are and can see what little political and intellectual worth they have . As for this new character who has entered the scene with his sinister manoeuvres against Cuba , whom is he hoping to deceive ? We refer to John Bolton , Under-Secretary of State , responsible for nothing less than arms control . What exactly is this official hoping to achieve with his inflammatory and aggressive speech against Cuba given at the Heritage Foundation , well known for its ultra-right stance ? These statements , purportedly an analysis of the dangers of terrorism threatening the United States , began by saying : "" In addition to Libya and Syria , there is a threat coming from another signatory to the Biological Weapons Convention , and one that lies just 90 miles from the United States mainland - namely , Cuba . "" Then , after the usual name-calling and absurd allegations filled with loathing that are so typical of arrogant and uninformed people , Mr Bolton added , this time off his own bat : "" We know that Cuba is collaborating with other State sponsors of terror . "" Castro has repeatedly denounced the United States' war on terrorism . He continues to view terror as a legitimate tactic to further revolutionary objectives . Last year , Castro visited Iran , Syria and Libya - all designees on the same list of terrorist-sponsoring States . At Tehran University , these were his words : ' Iran and Cuba , in cooperation with each other , can bring America to its knees . The United States regime is very weak , and we are witnessing this weakness from close up . ' "" But Cuba's threat to our security often has been underplayed . An official United States Government report in 1999 concluded that Cuba did not represent a significant military threat to the United States or the region . It went only so far as to say that ' Cuba has a limited capacity to engage in some military and intelligence activities which could pose a danger to United States citizens under some circumstances . ' "" Mr. Bolton then immediately started casting about for some explanation for the suspicious fact that no United States Government official had ever before thought to level such a deplorable accusation against Cuba . Bolton blames this weakness on William Cohen , who was United States Defence Secretary four years earlier when the much criticized report was issued . Bolton omitted to mention the fact that , a mere five months and two weeks before , on 19 November 2001 , he himself had not made the slightest reference to Cuba in his address to the Fifth Review Conference of the Parties to the Biological Weapons Convention in Geneva , when he cited many countries that were of concern to him as potential producers of biological weapons . So why this sudden and unexpected change ? Mr. Bolton's scurrilous remarks of 6 May conclude with the allegation : "" For four decades Cuba has maintained a well developed and sophisticated biomedical industry , supported until 1990 by the Soviet Union . This industry is one of the most advanced in Latin America and leads in the production of pharmaceuticals and vaccines that are sold worldwide . Analysts and Cuban defectors have long cast suspicion on the activities conducted in these biomedical facilities . "" Here is what we now know : The United States believes that Cuba has at least a limited offensive biological warfare research-and-development effort . Cuba has provided dual-use biotechnology to other rogue States . We are concerned that such technology could support biological weapons programmes in those States . We call on Cuba to cease all biological weapons-applicable cooperation with rogue States and to comply fully with all of its obligations under the Biological Weapons Convention . "" Just as he had hoped , Mr. Bolton's string of barefaced lies was immediately picked up by the international press . "" Washington , 6 May ( ANSA ) . Under-Secretary of State John Bolton today accused Cuba of helping ' enemy Governments ' with biological weapons programmes . "" ' Cuba has at least an offensive biological weapons programme and could be transferring its results to other States hostile to the United States ' , said Bolton . "" Under-Secretary Bolton was speaking to the Heritage Foundation , one of the ultra-conservative groups in Washington . "" "" Washington , 6 May ( DPA ) . The United States today accused Cuba of developing offensive biological weapons and of providing information about these weapons to States hostile to the United States , and urged President Fidel Castro's Government to cease this cooperation . "" "" Washington , 6 May ( Reuters ) . On Monday , the United States accused three countries - Cuba , Libya and Syria - of trying to develop weapons of mass destruction and warned that it would take steps to prevent them from providing these arms to terrorist groups . "" ' States that sponsor terrorism and seek to obtain weapons of mass destruction must cease these activities ' , he said . ' States that renounce terror and abandon weapons of mass destruction can become part of our effort . But those which do not can expect to become our targets . ' "" "" Washington , 6 May ( EFE ) . The United States today added Cuba , Libya and Syria to the list of countries which form the ' axis of evil ' intent on manufacturing weapons of mass destruction , and warned that it would take steps to prevent them from supplying such weapons to terrorist organizations . "" "" Washington , 6 May ( Notimex ) . The United States today included Cuba on the so-called ' axis of evil ' , because it believed that it has the capacity to develop biological weapons which would pose a threat to its security , greater than that posed by Iraq , Iran and North Korea . "" "" Washington , 6 May ( AFP ) . On Monday , the United States warned Cuba against any proliferation of biological weapons , urging the island's Government to cease any supplies of biotechnological equipment to countries that Washington considers potentially dangerous , such as Iraq and Libya . "" The list of such articles and reports on this issue could be continued indefinitely . So , the deed has already been done ! The whole world , and in particular the American public , which is constantly bombarded with shameless lies , has been fed the necessary information and is now ready to believe that Cuba is a biological power , that it has a programme for the production of such weapons and that it poses a danger to the United States . And , as this has been stated by Mr. John Bolton , the very distinguished Under-Secretary of State for Arms Control and International Security , we have to believe it . Tired old tricks and stupid arguments As the old saying goes , it is easier to catch a liar than a lame man . Some people in the United States itself find all this simply too hard to believe and are beginning to read between the lines . "" Washington , 7 May ( Notimex ) . The United States today refused to produce the evidence it claimed to have to back up accusations it had made against Cuba to the effect that the island had a limited capacity to develop chemical and biological weapons . "" The spokesmen of both the White House and the State Department maintained that the accusation against Cuba was not based on assumptions but on confidential information about the biological and chemical potential of the Cuban pharmaceutical industry . "" This accusation came as a surprise not only to the international community , but even to members of the United States Congress . According to the same dispatch , "" Political analysts pointed out that the accusation against Cuba by the Bush administration could form part of a White House strategy to justify moves to tighten its isolationist policy on Cuba . "" The statement that Cuba could pose a terrorist threat to United States security was made at a time when several proposals to relax Washington's Cuba policy were being studied on Capitol Hill . "" Political analysts believe , however , that , given this possibility , and bearing in mind that his brother Jeb will be seeking re-election as Governor of Florida this year , President Bush is hoping to ingratiate himself with the Cuban exile community . "" Given that more than four decades of economic blockade against Cuba have not succeeded in removing Fidel Castro from power in Havana , the only people who want this isolationist policy to remain in effect and to be tightened are the great majority of the Cuban exile community in the United States . "" The possibility of including Cuba as a member of the so-called ' axis of evil ' , with Iraq , Iran and North Korea at its head , would make it easier for Bush to obtain Congress backing for moves to increase - rather than decrease - the economic stranglehold which it has on the island . "" "" Washington , 7 May ( AP ) . ' I think that it will hold up the adoption of any new steps towards an opening up of trade , ' said Bob Graham , chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence . ' Unilateral steps will be most affected . ' "" Graham did not hide his amazement at Bolton's accusation , however . He said that , in March , the Committee he chairs had held a secret hearing on security-related issues and that the administration had made no mention of biological weapons . "" On 7 May , when a journalist asked White House spokesman Ari Fleischer : "" Is there any proof of this or is this an assumption by the United States ? "" Fleischer replied : "" No , it 's not an assumption . I assure you that Secretary Bolton would not have said it if he did not have good cause , reasons and facts to base it on . It was based on sound analysis and on information available to the United States Government , which it has studied . "" This is a typical reply by someone who has no grounds or substance for what he says . The only things being carefully studied are falsehoods and deceitful ploys . One pities this spokesman for the job he has to do . Besides , why should we believe Mr. Bolton anyway ? Anyone who remembers the 15 incredible pretexts , which have come to light today in declassified official documents , that were devised at the end of 1961 by the powers that be in the United States with the aim of launching a direct military attack against Cuba in 1962 , would find nothing surprising in this sinister fabrication . But we demand proof . Let them produce even the smallest shred of evidence ! They do not have any and they can not have any since there is not and can not be any such evidence . As there is not so much as an atom of truth in what they say , they should not now try and hide behind the alleged sensitivity of their sources . This is a worn out old trick and an extremely stupid argument , which only serves to show in what very low esteem they hold the American public , whose intelligence deserves greater respect . I will also say this : If Cuban scientists from any of our biotechnology institutes had been cooperating with any country in the development of biological weapons , or had tried to create such weapons on their own initiative they would immediately be hauled before a court of justice on a charge of treason . The Acts of Terrorism Act passed by the National Assembly of Cuba stipulates , in its article 10 : "" Anyone who manufactures , facilitates , sells , transports , transfers , introduces into the country or keeps in his or her possession , under any form or in any place [ ... ] chemical or biological agents , or any other substance from which any product that fits this description can be derived through research , design or a combination thereof "" shall be liable to penalties of between 10 and 30 years privation of liberty , life imprisonment or death . This is , without question , a total fabrication , a treacherous blow against the sale of food to Cuba authorized by a law passed in 2000 , which has subsequently undergone countless modifications and amendments , introduced by those bitterly opposed to any lifting of the blockade , rendering it virtually unworkable , even when - despite everything - it was finally passed . Efforts are also being made to mislead and discourage the growing number of Americans who are increasingly repelled by the cruel and inhuman measures taken against the Cuban people , which fly in the face of the idealism and ethics of a nation which , for years and years , has been fed nothing but lies about Cuba . The only truth in Bolton's falsehoods was the geographical fact that Cuba lies 90 miles from the continental territory of the United States . Slanderous invention , born of falsehood and deception It is false and a total distortion to assert that our country has repeatedly denounced the United States' war against terrorism . I have said , and I stand by it , that the solution to this scourge will not be attained through war , which will serve only to breed hatred and fanaticism , but through sincere and determined cooperation among all countries in the world and by building a truly universal culture and mindset against terrorism . We were the first to suggest this form of cooperation , the very day of the tragedy in New York . It was a slanderous invention , born of falsehood and deception , to assert that Castro considers terrorism a legitimate tactic for furthering revolutionary objectives , since , as everyone knows , our revolutionary movement never practised any methods which were not consistent with our doctrine , our principles and our perception of armed struggle . You should get your facts straight , Mr. Bolton , and you should not be misled by the fictions narrated by your good friends in the Foundation . The civilian population and innocent people have never been the victims of our actions . Our tactic was always to fight against fully equipped enemy units . These days you seem to want to label as terrorism any armed resistance , regardless of the legitimate causes that may justify it . Applying this logic , you would be quite capable of describing as terrorism the struggle of the American colonists who rebelled and fought against English domination . George Washington and those who , after long years of war and enormous sacrifices , finally secured the independence of the United States were not terrorists . Your people led you astray , Mr. Bolton , when they told you about my address at the University of Tehran . It was not one address , but two , in two universities , and a few remarks which I made at the end of my visit to the mausoleum in which the body of the late Imam Khomeini lies . I have gone over them all in detail . In my address to the students in Tehran , there does not seem to be a single paragraph resembling that mendaciously cited in your statement on 6 May to the Heritage Foundation . At no point did I say that "" Iran and Cuba , in cooperation with each other , can bring America to its knees "" . I did say , in one of the three statements I made during the visit , that imperialism was bereft of ideas , that ideas were more powerful than weapons and that one day imperialism would collapse . I also said that the Shah "" was overthrown by the Iranian people through their heroism , and without weapons , which demonstrated the power of ideas and showed that there could never be any person in the world so powerful that he could not be brought down by ideas . This is our hope "" . And , at the end , I added : "" there is one super-Power which has thousands of nuclear weapons , aircraft , battleships , aircraft carriers , smart missiles [ ... ] . However many weapons it may possess and however great its wealth , it will never be able to defeat the human spirit "" . I did not make the slightest allusion to the use of weapons in this struggle . Indeed , I said just the opposite . That is what I think , that is how I saw it then and that is what I said . I am not in the habit of hiding my thoughts or twisting my words . My three statements in the Iranian capital were broadcast on Cuban radio and television . Thus , Mr. Bolton did not uncover anything , nor do I renounce any of my ideas . I said some other things about political beliefs and principles . I have all the tapes and the transcripts of those statements and I can prove what I said . I should also point out that , when I visited Iran , I had the honour of discovering a country with a culture thousands of years old , with deep religious convictions and great spiritual strength ; a country anxious to eradicate poverty , to fight against drug trafficking and other such plagues , a country determined to bring education , health , employment and well-being to more than 65 million people . Not one of the many leaders with whom I talked said anything to me about biological weapons or weapons of any other kind . I was able to see what an immense difference there is between the culture and customs of that country and those of the West . Iran was not the only country I visited : I went also to Algeria , Malaysia , Qatar , Syria and , finally , Libya , where I was shown how Qadaffi's family home had been destroyed and I heard about the loss of human life - including that of a little girl - inflicted by the brutal F-16 air raid . Those parts of the world which I visited possess a wealth of history thousands of years old , which must not be destroyed and neither must their populations be annihilated . Thousands of millions of people throughout the world have watched with profound indignation the televised images of the horrendous events in Palestine . When he referred to my statement in Iran , Mr. Bolton irresponsibly and dishonestly mixed up excerpts of what I had said with bits and pieces of statements made by other people and reported by foreign press agencies and information from other sources picked up from wire-service cables or material simply concocted by himself . He made such a dog's breakfast of all this material that he himself can no longer make head or tail of it . My clear , precise and transparent statements can be found in the speeches I have mentioned and in the press communiqué of 10 May 2001 issued by both delegations , which , in paragraph 6 of the agreed document , sets out the Cuban position against terrorism , which states , and I quote : "" While condemning the phenomenon of terrorism in all its forms , especially State terrorism , the two parties agreed to cooperate closely at bilateral and international levels to fight against and eliminate this terrible phenomenon , to cooperate in efforts to combat international organized crime and drug trafficking , being always mindful of the cardinal principles of international law , and in particular those of sovereignty and non-interference in the internal affairs of States . "" This statement was issued 127 days before 11 September . I must thank Mr. Bolton for the praise which he heaps on our pharmaceutical industry : "" one of the most advanced in Latin America [ , which ] leads in the production of pharmaceuticals and vaccines that are sold worldwide , "" as he said in his own words . If only it were more advanced . Even his country could benefit from some of its attainments , but they would not permit it . He lies shamelessly , however , when he tells the American public and the world at large that the United States believes that Cuba is engaged in at least a limited offensive biological warfare research-and-development effort . This statement is as false as it is serious . Our researchers and doctors are educated in such a way as to instil in them a strong sense of solidarity and ethics . Millions of people in the world can testify to this . They work for the well-being and health of humankind . Over the last 40 years , 34,307 Cuban doctors and health workers have provided their services , free of charge , in a large number of poor countries , saving lives and safeguarding the health of millions of people . No one in the world could surpass them in their dedication and willingness to make sacrifices . At this very time , 2,671 of them are working in isolated and inhospitable areas of Latin America , the Caribbean and Africa . It would be very difficult to persuade these men and women to manufacture viruses and bacteria to kill children , women , old people or the citizens of any country . The pride and high moral standards of our people , which have enabled them to withstand 43 years of attacks and blockade , rest on the sound basis of a policy which is entirely consistent with all their ethics and principles . In all , some 39,800 young people from more than 120 Third-World countries have graduated in Cuba in 33 specialized academic and technical fields . Even under the prevailing conditions during this special period , induced by the cruel economic blockade , there are 8,053 young people from Latin America , the Caribbean and Africa following medical degree courses in our country - receiving training which , in the United States , costs more than $ 200 , 000 , without paying a single cent . Despite the lying allegations of Bolton and many others of his ilk , Cuba enjoys great recognition for the health services which it has rendered to humankind . These constitute a true fight against another form of terror , which many choose to ignore : the diseases which every year kill more than 11 million children , whose lives could be saved were it not for the selfish attitude of the industrialized world . An incalculable number of people survive or recover their health thanks to the selfless efforts of doctors from a small and poor country , who treat them with vaccines and preventive methods or therapies developed by Cuba . We would like to know if the United States Government is doing something similar or if it would be prepared to cooperate in such programmes for the benefit of what it euphemistically terms the "" emerging countries "" , since we have not excluded any economically developed country from participating in these programmes . We have offered hundreds of scholarships at the Latin American School of Medical Sciences to American youngsters who lack the funds to study medicine in their own country . Cuban children are vaccinated against 13 diseases and enjoy splendid health . The infant mortality rate per 1,000 live births is lower than that of the United States . Medical care is guaranteed to 100 per cent of the population and is provided absolutely free of charge . The sorry situation in the United States , with its more than 280 million inhabitants , where 16 per cent of the population , including more than 10 million children , have no medical insurance , is quite unknown in Cuba . In such an immensely rich and scientifically advanced country , where hundreds of thousands of citizens die every year for these reasons , who is held to blame ? Who kills these people and who denounces these deplorable facts ? How can they concoct such lies ? With what moral right dare they affirm from over there that we , in Cuba , are developing biological warfare ? Who is going to believe their monstrous slanders ? On the other hand , never over the 43 years of its history since the revolution has anyone in our country launched or taken part in any terrorist act mounted from our territory against the United States . Not a single drop of United States blood has been shed , nor has any company lost so much as a simple screw as a result of any terrorist act hatched in Cuba . This can not be said about Cuba by those in the United States who accuse our country of terrorism , or of supporting or sponsoring terrorism . Thousands of our compatriots have died and tens of thousands of acts of sabotage have been recorded as part of terrorist activities and aggression mounted from the United States against Cuba . How can their spokesmen deny these glaring facts ? I am not referring here to the American public : I am referring to their Governments . Not the slightest attempt has been made to clarify the overriding question of the powers granted to United States Government officials to conduct extrajudicial executions and to kill people anywhere in the world . I myself have often been the target of their sinister plans . That was how they operated in the past . Have they or have they not now reverted to those repugnant methods ? Why does Mr. Bolton not tell us something about that instead ? Cuba's irreproachable policy on weapons of mass destruction Where weapons of mass destruction are concerned , Cuba's policies have been irreproachable . No one has ever produced a single shred of evidence that our country has embarked on a programme to develop nuclear , chemical or biological weapons . Even people who have no comprehension of the ethics , the attachment to the truth and the transparency which informs the conduct of a Government like that of Cuba will be able to understand at least that for Cuba to have acted in any other way would have been an act of immense stupidity . Any such programme would ruin the economy of a small country : Cuba would never have been able to transport such weapons and it would have been a further mistake to have used them in combat against an enemy which had thousands more such weapons and would have been only too delighted for an excuse to use them . From the political standpoint , we are living in an age that will bring weapons far more powerful than any that technology can produce : namely , the weapons of morality , reason and ideas . Without these , no country is powerful ; with them , no country is weak . To adhere to this maxim , any country needs to be extremely motivated , clear-headed and perspicacious . Let it be known that the Cuban people revere above all other things on earth the ideals that inspire freedom , dignity , love of their country , their identity and their culture , and the strictest possible adherence to justice . These are not weapons of mass destruction : they are weapons of mass moral defence and we are willing to fight and die for them . I understand that , for a man like Bolton , intoxicated with the military , economic and technological might of the super-Power on whose behalf he speaks , it might be difficult to understand these things . It would , however , be a good thing for him to try . Cuba has absolutely nothing to hide . On the contrary , it is proud of its progress in the field of biomedical research . Let us briefly review its history : 1979 : The Genetic Engineering Group was set up in the National Centre for Scientific Research ; 1981 : The first biotechnological scientific production institution designed for the manufacture of the Leukocyte Interferon was set up ; The pharmaceutical and biotechnological industry programme came into being as a result of the country's scientific , economic and social development ; The necessary standards were set in place for inspection and certification by international agencies and the regulatory bodies of those countries with which Cuba was to have trade relations ; The period between 1990 and 1997 saw the development of the bulk of the investment programme , comprising 40 separate facilities ; An exclusively humanitarian industry is being developed , dedicated to the development and manufacture of medicines designed to prevent illnesses and to save lives , as well as to food production ; Technology and equipment used everywhere in the world is being purchased from commercial companies with international standing ; Under agreements entered into by Cuba with the Biological Weapons Convention , Cuba's biotechnology , health system and civil defence sectors submit annual reports to the United Nations on confidence-building measures ; Regulatory bodies from many different countries have visited Cuban biotechnology production facilities as a prerequisite for the marketing of our products in their countries ; Over the next few years , more than 50 new products , including biopharmaceuticals , vaccines and diagnostic kits , will come onto the market ; Cuba already possesses a wealth of intellectual property , comprising more than 150 inventions and over 500 patents registered abroad . The results of Cuban scientific research are published in leading international journals ; 1990 : First exports of Cuban products , which have increased every year since ; 1992 : Cuba signed the Convention on Biological Diversity and ratified it in 1994 ; 1995 : Landmark forms of marketing are introduced : technology transfers , risk contracts for development projects with foreign companies , manufacturing and trading partnerships ; Today , products and technology of the Cuban biotechnology industry are to be found in more than 40 countries . Technology transfer agreements or negotiations have been concluded or are under way with 14 countries : India : 4 transfers , 4 products ; China : 2 transfers , 4 products ; Brazil : 2 transfers , 2 products ; Egypt : 4 transfers , 1 product under negotiation ; Malaysia : 6 transfers ; Iran : 4 transfers , 4 products ; Russia : 1 transfer , 1 product ; South Africa : 1 transfer , 1 product ; Tunisia : 1 transfer , 1 product ; Algeria : 1 transfer , 3 products ; United Kingdom - Belgium : 1 transfer , 1 product ; Venezuela : 1 transfer , 2 products under negotiation ; Mexico : 1 transfer , 1 product . New trade and production negotiations are under way with 10 countries : Malaysia , Netherlands , Spain , Brazil , Venezuela , Viet Nam , Mexico , Ukraine , Germany and the United States ( negotiations are under way with the United States on the use of the Cuban anti-meningitis vaccine and the first steps have been made towards possible clinical trials with the EGF vaccine for lung cancer ) . Cuba's biotechnology centres have already registered : 24 products , including both biopharmaceuticals and vaccines ; 49 state-of-the-art generic medicines ; 5 products for treating AIDS ; 15 new types of medical equipment ; 24 diagnostic systems . In addition to these achievements , scientists and researchers are continuing work on 60 more projects , prominent among which are the following : 29 new vaccines , including 8 cancer vaccines , 4 of which are already undergoing clinical trials , not only in Cuba but also in Canada , Argentina and the United Kingdom ; 21 innovative products for treating cancer , which supplement the 28 cytostatic drugs that have already been identified and which a new plant will soon begin manufacturing . Cuba's biotechnology centres have applied for patents for 150 inventions , which will bring the total of such patents to 505 . Four of these have been awarded medals by the World Intellectual Property Organization ( WIPO ) . Countless prominent politicians , scientists and industrialists have visited Cuba's biotechnology institutions . One of its main centres alone played host in 2000 to 1,520 visitors , 484 of whom came from the United States . The doors of our research centres are open to any international institution . In an official , public letter , Cuba has written to the Government of the United States to propose three major draft agreements , which are of greater benefit to the United States than to Cuba itself , given the very different magnitude of the problems in each of the two countries . The first is a draft agreement on immigration issues ; the second , a draft agreement on cooperation in controlling the illicit traffic in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances ; and the third , a draft bilateral cooperation programme to combat terrorism . We have not received any reply . Does this mean that we are being accused of manufacturing biological weapons ? Whom do they hope to intimidate in this way ? We are urged to cease any biological weapons-related cooperation with "" rogue "" States and to comply with all our obligations under the Biological Weapons Convention . Which is the international organization that decides whether or not a country is a "" rogue "" State ? Precisely which rule of the Biological Weapons Convention has Cuba violated ? Is it that , on top of the criminal blockade , they would now ban us from marketing our medicines and using the most beneficial , the most noble products of the talents and hard work of our scientists , they would prevent us from placing these at the service of the health of people anywhere in the world ? Or could it be that the United States Government is seeking another bilateral agreement , in addition to those proposed by Cuba , namely , on cooperation in efforts to combat the production of biological weapons ? Please propose it . We would be happy to include it in our list of projects under consideration . We are sorry , Mr. Bolton . After the lies , slander , fabrications and insults promulgated in your statement on 6 May , we regret to have to tell you that you have no moral ground to harangue Cuba on this subject , still less to do so in a threatening tone and language . Nor can you presume to give Cuba any lessons in politics and ethics . In any event , you and your Government should draw inspiration from Cuba's decent and honourable behaviour . I can assure you that , for this technology transfer , we shall be making no charge . </doc>

67,A4,"Part One , Chapter 11 Levin emptied his glass , and they were silent for a while . "" There 's one other thing I ought to tell you . Do you know Vronsky ? "" Stepan Arkadyevitch asked Levin . "" No , I do n't . Why do you ask ? "" "" Give us another bottle , "" Stepan Arkadyevitch directed the Tatar , who was filling up their glasses and fidgeting round them just when he was not wanted . "" Why you ought to know Vronsky is that he 's one of your rivals . "" "" Who 's Vronsky ? "" said Levin , and his face was suddenly transformed from the look of childlike ecstasy which Oblonsky had just been admiring to an angry and unpleasant expression . "" Vronsky is one of the sons of Count Kirill Ivanovitch Vronsky , and one of the finest specimens of the gilded youth of Petersburg . I made his acquaintance in Tver when I was there on official business , and he came there for the levy of recruits . Fearfully rich , handsome , great connections , an aide-de-camp , and with all that a very nice , good-natured fellow . But he 's more than simply a good-natured fellow , as I 've found out here – he 's a cultivated man , too , and very intelligent ; he 's a man who 'll make his mark . "" Levin scowled and was dumb . "" Well , he turned up here soon after you 'd gone , and as I can see , he 's over head and ears in love with Kitty , and you know that her mother ... "" "" Excuse me , but I know nothing , "" said Levin , frowning gloomily . And immediately he recollected his brother Nikolay and how hateful he was to have been able to forget him . "" You wait a bit , wait a bit , "" said Stepan Arkadyevitch , smiling and touching his hand . "" I 've told you what I know , and I repeat that in this delicate and tender matter , as far as one can conjecture , I believe the chances are in your favor . "" Levin dropped back in his chair ; his face was pale . "" But I would advise you to settle the thing as soon as may be , "" pursued Oblonsky , filling up his glass . "" No , thanks , I ca n ' t drink any more , "" said Levin , pushing away his glass . "" I shall be drunk .... Come , tell me how are you getting on ? "" he went on , obviously anxious to change the conversation . "" One word more : in any case I advise you to settle the question soon . Tonight I do n't advise you to speak , "" said Stepan Arkadyevitch . "" Go round tomorrow morning , make an offer in due form , and God bless you ... "" "" Oh , do you still think of coming to me for some shooting ? Come next spring , do , "" said Levin . Now his whole soul was full of remorse that he had begun this conversation with Stepan Arkadyevitch . A feeling such as his was profaned by talk of the rivalry of some Petersburg officer , of the suppositions and the counsels of Stepan Arkadyevitch . Stepan Arkadyevitch smiled . He knew what was passing in Levin's soul . "" I 'll come some day , "" he said . "" But women , my boy , they 're the pivot everything turns upon . Things are in a bad way with me , very bad . And it 's all through women . Tell me frankly now , "" he pursued , picking up a cigar and keeping one hand on his glass ; "" give me your advice . "" "" Why , what is it ? "" "" I 'll tell you . Suppose you 're married , you love your wife , but you 're fascinated by another woman ... "" "" Excuse me , but I 'm absolutely unable to comprehend how ... just as I ca n ' t comprehend how I could now , after my dinner , go straight to a baker's shop and steal a roll . "" Stepan Arkadyevitch's eyes sparkled more than usual . "" Why not ? A roll will sometimes smell so good one ca n ' t resist it . "" "" Himmlisch ist's , wenn ich bezwungen Meine irdische Begier ; Aber doch wenn's nich gelungen Hatt ' ich auch recht huebsch Plaisir ! "" As he said this , Stepan Arkadyevitch smiled subtly . Levin , too , could not help smiling . "" Yes , but joking apart , "" resumed Stepan Arkadyevitch , "" you must understand that the woman is a sweet , gentle loving creature , poor and lonely , and has sacrificed everything . Now , when the thing 's done , do n't you see , can one possibly cast her off ? Even supposing one parts from her , so as not to break up one's family life , still , can one help feeling for her , setting her on her feet , softening her lot ? "" "" Well , you must excuse me there . You know to me all women are divided into two classes ... at least no ... truer to say : there are women and there are ... I 've never seen exquisite fallen beings , and I never shall see them , but such creatures as that painted Frenchwoman at the counter with the ringlets are vermin to my mind , and all fallen women are the same . "" "" But the Magdalen ? "" "" Ah , drop that ! Christ would never have said those words if He had known how they would be abused . Of all the Gospel those words are the only ones remembered . However , I 'm not saying so much what I think , as what I feel . I have a loathing for fallen women . You 're afraid of spiders , and I of these vermin . Most likely you 've not made a study of spiders and do n't know their character ; and so it is with me . "" "" It 's very well for you to talk like that ; it 's very much like that gentleman in Dickens who used to fling all difficult questions over his right shoulder . But to deny the facts is no answer . What 's to be done – you tell me that , what 's to be done ? Your wife gets older , while you 're full of life . Before you 've time to look round , you feel that you ca n ' t love your wife with love , however much you may esteem her . And then all at once love turns up , and you 're done for , done for , "" Stepan Arkadyevitch said with weary despair . Levin half smiled . "" Yes , you 're done for , "" resumed Oblonsky . "" But what 's to be done ? "" "" Do n't steal rolls . "" Stepan Arkadyevitch laughed outright . "" Oh , moralist ! But you must understand , there are two women ; one insists only on her rights , and those rights are your love , which you ca n ' t give her ; and the other sacrifices everything for you and asks for nothing . What are you to do ? How are you to act ? There 's a fearful tragedy in it . "" "" If you care for my profession of faith as regards that , I 'll tell you that I do n't believe there was any tragedy about it . And this is why . To my mind , love ... both the sorts of love , which you remember Plato defines in his Banquet , served as the test of men . Some men only understand one sort , and some only the other . And those who only know the non-platonic love have no need to talk of tragedy . In such love there can be no sort of tragedy . ' I 'm much obliged for the gratification , my humble respects ' – that 's all the tragedy . And in platonic love there can be no tragedy , because in that love all is clear and pure , because ... "" At that instant Levin recollected his own sins and the inner conflict he had lived through . And he added unexpectedly : "" But perhaps you are right . Very likely ... I do n't know , I do n't know . "" "" It 's this , do n't you see , "" said Stepan Arkadyevitch , "" you 're very much all of a piece . That 's your strong point and your failing . You have a character that 's all of a piece , and you want the whole of life to be of a piece too – but that 's not how it is . You despise public official work because you want the reality to be invariably corresponding all the while with the aim – and that 's not how it is . You want a man's work , too , always to have a defined aim , and love and family life always to be undivided – and that 's not how it is . All the variety , all the charm , all the beauty of life is made up of light and shadow . "" Levin sighed and made no reply . He was thinking of his own affairs , and did not hear Oblonsky . And suddenly both of them felt that though they were friends , though they had been dining and drinking together , which should have drawn them closer , yet each was thinking only of his own affairs , and they had nothing to do with one another . Oblonsky had more than once experienced this extreme sense of aloofness , instead of intimacy , coming on after dinner , and he knew what to do in such cases . "" Bill ! "" he called , and he went into the next room where he promptly came across an aide-de-camp of his acquaintance and dropped into conversation with him about an actress and her protector . And at once in the conversation with the aide-de-camp Oblonsky had a sense of relaxation and relief after the conversation with Levin , which always put him to too great a mental and spiritual strain . When the Tatar appeared with a bill for twenty-six roubles and odd kopecks , besides a tip for himself , Levin , who would another time have been horrified , like any one from the country , at his share of fourteen roubles , did not notice it , paid , and set off homewards to dress and go to the Shtcherbatskys ' there to decide his fate . </doc>

383,A8,"First published on 25 July 2003 The last laugh DOUG Bower , who claims to have been Britain's first crop circle hoaxer , has been on the Marlborough Downs showing a Japanese film crew how it 's done . Mr Bower and his late friend Dave Chorley became famed as Doug and Dave when they claimed ten years ago that they had produced most of the crop circles for many years . The Southampton pair appeared on TV programmes showing how they made the cornfield patterns with trampling devices made from pieces of wood and rope . They managed to achieve the complex patterns , they said , with the aid of wire sights on the peaks of baseball caps . Mr Chorley died a couple of years ago but by that time the pair had long given up going out under the cover of darkness to make crop circles all over the South of England . On Thursday Mr Bower , who is now 79 , showed a Japanese film crew making a documentary how he could still make a crop pattern using the same piece of wood and rope he started out with in the late 1970s . The film company , Media Nations Inc , is making a documentary about Doug and Dave and their claim that they were the first people in the UK to make crop circles . And it paid dozens of local people £ 50 a day to act as extras . At the end of the first day 's filming Mr Bower , an artist and picture framer , told the Gazette that the only crop patterns that could be found until he and Mr Chorley teamed up were simple circles and swirls made by gusts of wind . Mr Bower said he had spent eight years living in Melbourne in Australia . "" It was while I was there in 1962 that I read about three circles appearing on a farm at Tulley in Queensland , "" he said . He returned to England in 1966 to live at Southampton where he opened an art gallery and became friendly with fellow painter Mr Chorley . Mr Bower said : "" We got to know each other well because we had the same interests and were both artists . "" They went out and about together painting on location and , said Mr Bower , it was while walking in fields near Winchester in 1978 that the idea of making crop circles came up in conversation . That was the start of Britain's first crop circle making team . "" Until then all the so-called crop circles had been the result of wind damage , "" said Mr Bower . On evenings over the next 14 years they travelled hundreds of miles from their homes in Southampton to make elaborate patterns in cereal crops as far away as Gloucestershire and Oxfordshire . Meanwhile they sat back and laughed , said Mr Bower , as so called experts began giving reasons for the crop circles ranging from inter-galactic messages to UFO landings . Mr Bower , who is still sprightly , said : "" We went as far as Eastbourne in the east and as far north as Wantage making crop circles at every opportunity we had . "" Sometimes , he said , they would make several in a night before returning home to Southampton by dawn , tired but ecstatic at the way they had the world hoodwinked . He said : "" We made a lot in Wiltshire because that is where the most fuss was being made about them because of the Avebury and Stonehenge link . "" We used to work out the designs on paper so that we knew what we would be doing when we got to a suitable field . "" I still have those original designs which prove how early we started making them . "" Mr Bower said he and his friend used to spend the winter in his studio planning bigger and more complex patterns to make the following summer . "" For 14 years we had everyone fooled , we were the only ones making the patterns although of course we never let on , "" said Mr Bower . He said one reason they continued for so long without telling the world what was causing the mysterious crop pictograms was to poke fun at the establishment and the many so-called experts who expounded serious and complex reasons for the phenomenon . "" We did it for 14 years without anybody being able to prove they were man-made , "" he said . "" Our big reward was in winding up those people who regarded themselves as experts and claimed they knew what was causing them . "" We knew what was causing them , it was us , and at that time we were the only people making them . "" Mr Bower said nowadays there are a number of teams competing to see who can make the biggest and most complex patterns . The documentary was filmed on Richard Hues' land at Stanton St Bernard and the farmer was compensated by the Japanese production company for the damage to his crop . Among those paid to act as extras was Marlborough mum Bryony Sutton and her 20-year-old daughter Rosie . Both had just completed a film making course at Swindon College and were interested in seeing how the professionals worked . Mrs Sutton said : "" The director recruited extras from the Barge Inn at Honeystreet and from some other places and we spent three days filming at Alton Barnes and Stanton St Bernard . "" Rosie played a journalist ostensibly reporting on the crop circle mania . Mrs Sutton said : "" The film crew and the director were all fine , they were very sweet . "" There was a terrible problem though with the language barrier which caused a few difficulties to start with . "" They spoke little English and our Japanese was non existent but it was all a good laugh . "" The programme will be show on Nippon TV in Japan but may be syndicated worldwide .

1132,A17,"' Hacksaw Ridge ' Review : Mel Gibson Returns With a War Movie About Peace The controversial actor-filmmaker makes a violent , bloody WWII about conscientious objector Desmond T. Doss – and attempts an atonement ' Hacksaw Ridge ' is Mel Gibson's brilliant , bloody biopic about a WWII pacifist – Peter Travers on why you need to see it come hell or high water . ' Hacksaw Ridge ' Review : Mel Gibson Returns With a War Movie About Peace More News Mel Gibson is back , directing the bloody hell out of a war movie about ... peace . You may have issues with the star's past history of anger and intolerance . But you 'll have no issue with Hacksaw Ridge , a movie about a different kind of brave heart . It 's the fact-based , World War II story of Private First Class Desmond T. Doss , the first conscientious objector to receive the Congressional Medal of Honor . Andrew Garfield , in the best performance of his career to date , plays Desmond , a feisty kid out of Virginia's Blue Ridge mountains who swears never to pick up a gun ( he almost killed his daddy with one ) and swears just as vehemently to go into combat as a medic . How does this cornstalk-skinny pacifist , a devoted Seventh-Day Adventist , enter the front lines where you shoot to kill just to stay alive ? Related Hollywood pariah returns with this story of real-life WWII conscientious objector That 's the heart of the film that Gibson directs with no-bull sincerity from a script by Robert Schenkkan ( The Pacific ) and Andrew Knight that digs past clichés to touch a raw nerve . Desmond's father , Tom ( a superb Hugo Weaving ) , is so traumatized by his service in World War I that he forbids his sons to enlist . The boys , who 've have no problem defying Dad when he drunkenly abuses their mother , Bertha ( Rachel Griffiths ) , defy him again . Desmond's brother Hal ( Nathaniel Buzolic ) enlists soon after the Japanese bomb Pearl Harbor . And our hero , though crazy in love with Dorothy ( the excellent Teresa Palmer ) , a nurse at the hospital where he gets medical schooling , is determined to follow . Basic training takes on new layers of meaning as Desmond shirks no duty , except for rifle practice . That decision angers both Sgt. Howell ( Vince Vaughn , doing gruff ) and the fellow recruits , who mistake his principles for cowardice . Attempts are made to drive this renegade out of the Army , even using the threat of court-martial . Desmond's dad turns up in an unexpected defense of his son . It 's a tribute to Garfield's total commitment to the role that he never lets easy sentiment color the force of the character's convictions . Not surprisingly , it 's the scenes of battle that send Hacksaw Ridge roaring to life , with Gibson and cinematographer Simon Duggan refusing to flinch from the harsh realities of ground warfare . The rocky slope from which the film takes its title is the Japanese stronghold that Desmond's battalion must destroy before they can take Okinawa . Gibson captures the most brutal and bloody screen carnage since his own Braveheart and the opening sequence of Steven Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan . And it 's here that Desmond , staying behind as his troops are forced to pull out , repeatedly returns amid bullets , bombs and grenade blasts , to round up wounded soldiers , 75 in all , and lower them by rope down the ridge and to safety . Thanks to some of the greatest battle scenes ever filmed , Gibson once again shows his staggering gifts as a filmmaker , able to juxtapose savagery with aching tenderness . There 's always been more than an adrenaline rush in his work : Look at Braveheart ( for which he won the Oscar as best director ) , The Passion of the Christ ( the most successful R-rated indie film of all-time ) and the masterful , misunderstood Apocalypto , released a decade ago – i.e. , roughly about the time LA cops got him on a DUI and his rants put him in the public doghouse . Hacksaw Ridge is being touted as Gibson's comeback . Is it also an atonement ? Who can say ? What 's clear is that Gibson has made a film about family , faith , love and forgiveness all put the test in an arena of violent conflict – a movie you do n't want to miss .

1083,A11,"The schedule of a Happiness Engineer working in live chat When I was first hired as Trial Happiness Engineer , I was concerned about the flexibility of live chat . I imagined a live chat operator being chained to their desk all day . But since this is Automattic the pioneers of remote working , how was this possible ? How was it going to work ? Now I work on as a Happiness Engineer on a team that has a primary focus on live chat . Part of what attracted me to Automattic was the schedule flexibility . I 'm happy to say I have a very flexible schedule and I do n't work the typical 9am – 5pm Monday thru Friday schedule . I 'm also anything but tied to my desk . So how does it all work ? Scheduling / Flexibility The following is my own personal schedule , but each Happiness Engineer is different . There is no one-size-fits-all schedule for Happiness Engineers . At Automattic we have a saying that communication is oxygen . Since everyone has a different schedule , part of the oxygen that allows the Happiness team to function is communicating your schedule . Since every Happiness Engineer does this , this allows for us to efficiently schedule coverage for the week . I make my own schedule . It 's flexible in that I pick the days and times that I work , which amount to 40 hrs a week . Out of those 40 hrs my goal is to spend around 25 hrs live chatting . Currently , we sign up for live chat shifts . So I pick the hours I 'd like to live chat . We have a rough estimate about how many Happiness Engineers we need per an hour . Happiness Engineers get to sign up for which hours they 'd like to work . So it 's a balance of working the hours I 'd like but also trying to work hours where we need more coverage . What does a typical day look like ? I consider my "" core "" work to be live chatting . So I spend between 4-5 hrs live chatting each day . I then schedule the rest of my day around my live chat shifts . Around 1 hr answering tickets Then I spend around 30 minutes to an hour catching up on p2 posts & Slack and commenting ( p2 posts are our internal blog system ) . I also try to give myself between 30 minutes -1 hr each day for time to follow up with any live chats , where I need to test something or send them a follow up email . How flexible is Automattic with scheduling ? In my personal opinion , very flexible . I 'm not a morning person . I 've found I need a few days during the week to sleep in or do errands . This keeps me happiest . So on Wednesdays and Fridays , I start work at noon . Yeah , really ... 12pm . I also tend to work Sunday afternoon-evening anyways , preparing for the week . This works out great , because I get to help out with weekend & evening coverage . So on average I work around 4-6 hours every weekend . Here is what my weekly schedule looks like : My Personal Schedule If I need to take off work a bit early one day , I would log in later in the evening or weekend to help with coverage there . I communicate with my team and my team lead about these kind of changes in my schedule often . For example , when I 'm testing changes to my schedule and trying out new hours to see what works best for me and for live chat coverage . I let them know . This communication is healthy and let 's them know when I 'm around in case they need me . I never felt like I had to jump through hoops to get what I personally feel like is my dream schedule . I feel like Automattic trusts me to work the hours that I need to work , and that I find a schedule that keeps me happy , productive , and contributes to my team's goals . While I choose my own schedule , I try to schedule myself for times when I 'm needed the most . The wonderful thing about Automattic is that we truly are a remote company and no matter what time you choose to work - there is always plenty to do Having a company that is so flexible with me and my schedule , I tend to be flexible in return . If I notice that we may need an extra hand in the evenings or weekends , if it 's not a huge inconvenience to me or my schedule , I jump in and help out . This does n't mean that I work "" extra "" hours - I switch out those hours for hours that are well covered and either take a longer lunch to run an errand or leave a bit earlier then usual on another day . I still work around 40hrs a week , with those switches . I spent a good 9 months testing out schedules trying to find what worked best for me , before I settled on the schedule I 've currently working . Being flexible but consistent I 've personally found that the key to my own efficiency was being consistent . I 've spent about a year testing different times of the day that I live chat best at . I 'm best when I chat roughly around the same time each day . I 've also found that I do n't like working in live chat for more then 2 . 5hrs at time . Usually by then I 'm ready for a break and want to step away from the computer for a bit . I 'm most productive when I live chat right before lunch or the end of the day , so I get a nice break after my live chat shift . So on most days from 9am – 11 : 30am and then again from 2 : 30pm – 5 : 00pm works best for my schedule . When I do my best to generally do my "" core work "" during those hours this helps me get more done , since my brain now is hard-wired to know that it is crunch time . For each live chat shift - I stay in one place . I 'm either at home at my desk or at my coworking spot . I try to stay in a place where I can be most effective there since I have fast wifi and a large screen for multiple windows . Although somedays ... when I need a change of scenery I 'll go to a local coffee shop for my live chat session . Of course , this is what works best for me . Each Happiness Engineer is different and prefers a different schedule . Live Chatting : What 's it like ? One of my biggest concerns as Happiness Engineer Trial was Live Chat . I found the idea of it to be very intimidating . What 's live chat actually like though ? Well ... my first few live chats were a little nerve wrecking . After I got over my own fears , I found live chat to be so much fun . It 's my favorite way to support our users - since I 'm able to resolve a users issue in real time . Once you get a good rhythm , I 've found it to be easier to connect with our users via live chat . I 'm able to get to know them ... and the sites that they 're building . Our users are awesome . They 're kind and patient . So getting to chat with them all day is fun ! What kind of questions are you asked in live chat ? There are all different kinds of questions that come in , and you never know what you 're going to get . We get a lot of domain questions . Which is one of my favorite things to troubleshoot now . For example , when it comes to helping a user map a domain they own elsewhere to use with their WordPress.com site by updating name server settings or by helping a user purchase a domain . We also get a lot of questions about getting a theme set up or selecting a theme for their site . Do you have to know the answer to everything ? I can say that I certainly do n't know everything . While I 'm always striving to learn more . Something that 's helped me be successful is focusing on how to search for the answer . Knowing where to look for the answer is more then half the battle for me rather than having the pressure of knowing every single answer . Also for when I ca n't find the answer to a question , we have a Slack channel specifically for those in Live Chat . Since you 're working in live chat with a group of other Happiness Engineers , we 're all in the same Slack channel together and it 's pretty active . It 's one of my favorite channels because the conversation easily shifts between helping each other troubleshoot and small talk . I rely heavily on this channel . So even when I do n't know the answer , someone there usually does . It 's a great resource and helped me feel like I had a safety net for when I first jumped into live chat . So in Summary ... I love my schedule , live chatting , and Automattic . It really is a blast and the cool part is you could join us because we 're hiring . If you have any questions about my schedule or how Happiness Engineers schedule themselves , leave a comment below ! Hi Tish ! This is n't necessarily a schedule question , but as someone who is looking to apply for a Happiness Engineer position , do you have any pointers ? I know it 's absolutely necessary to stand out among the crowd . Any suggestions you have would be wonderful Thank you ! Your article inspired me to go for it and apply at Automattic ! You 've made me super dee duper excited about interviewing for the HE position ! I love that the interview is via Slack ... What a cool concept ! I 'm soooooo excited !! I hope to join you and the rest of the team ... definitely my type of vibe Thanks for this great "" day in the life ! "" Can I ask you how much previous experience you had with wordpresss + HTML / css you had prior to this position ? I am interested in applying to this role but am not sure that my coding skills are up to par ... </doc>

342,A12,"Eben Sadie : winery profile by Richard Kelley MW It is fitting that Eben ' surfer-philosopher ' Sadie should name his wine after Lucius Junius Moderatus Columella , author of ' De Rustica ' ( ' On Country Matters ' ) , the most comprehensive account of Roman viticulture that dates back two millennia . The wine itself comes from seven different , unirrigated , fully controlled leased parcels across 52km of the Swartland . The area has a remarkably stable climate , allowing for consistent quality albeit with vintage variation . The distinction of Columella is derived from its terroir , the character of the vintage and a very hands off winemaking approach ( more time for surfing , or jetting off to Spain to prune vineyards , or to rack wine in his Priorato venture ) . Columella is primarily Syrah with 10 % Mourvèdre ( in 2000 ) . Five of the seven parcels are planted with bushvines and each site reflects a different soil profile , encompassing slate ( at Porcelain Mountain ) , coffee stone , an iron rich soil ( Rheeboksfontein ) , and granite ( Aprilskloof ) . To say selection is rigorous is an understatement . The vines are pruned to allow for around 25 hl / ha so as to encourage full phenolic maturity . Picking takes place in the early morning into 15kg lug boxes and refrigerated down to 5 degrees C for 24 hours , when a team of 20 women painstakingly select , often grape by grape , into a final selection bin . These are destemmed and about 50 % are crushed and allowed to cold soak for two to four days . All parcels are vinified separately . Fermentation takes place in open wooden vats with native yeasts using traditional pigeage . Post fermentation maceration lasts up to three weeks , depending on the vineyard . The grapes are pressed in a tiny basket press and transferred ( with buckets ) into oak barrels , not all of them new , where malolactic takes place and the wine is racked through a primitive system relying solely on gravity . After blending at about eight months , Eben allows for 24 months in barrel before bottling unfined and unfiltered . Just over 5,000 bottles were produced of the 2000 vintage , and in 2001 , the extremely low crop yielded just 15hl / ha . In South Africa , these are highly sought after wines , aided by a five star rating for the 2000 in the John Platter Guide . With the retail price the equivalent of £ 35 a bottle in one Cape Town wine shop , at around £ 26.00 in England , there is an obvious opportunity to re-export what little 2000 we still have available . With 2002 , we see the introduction of a white partner , Palladius , the successor to Columella . This wine is a revelation , tasting nothing like any other wine made in the southern hemisphere - Eben's inspiration here being the white produced at Clos Mogador . It is a blend of Viognier , Chardonnay , Chenin Blanc and ( uncertified ) Grenache Blanc . The Viognier component was fermented as red wine ; on both skins and stalks , which explains the tannic edge . The Chenin is from 45 year old bush vines and the Chardonnay from 25 year old vines , making them some of the oldest in the Cape ( in 1981 there were only 19ha planted in the whole of SA ) . The wine took a year to complete fermentation , being in older wood for 16 months . Only eight barrels were made . The wine's individuality has made it a challenge for a South African palate bought up on crisp , clean Sauvignon or over-wooded Chardonnay ; however we believe it will be Palladius that finally gives Eben the international recognition he deserves . </doc>

268,A7,"8.1 Thread State and the Global Interpreter Lock The Python interpreter is not fully thread safe . In order to support multi-threaded Python programs , there 's a global lock that must be held by the current thread before it can safely access Python objects . Without the lock , even the simplest operations could cause problems in a multi-threaded program : for example , when two threads simultaneously increment the reference count of the same object , the reference count could end up being incremented only once instead of twice . Therefore , the rule exists that only the thread that has acquired the global interpreter lock may operate on Python objects or call Python / C API functions . In order to support multi-threaded Python programs , the interpreter regularly releases and reacquires the lock -- by default , every ten bytecode instructions ( this can be changed with sys . s etcheckinterval ( )) . The lock is also released and reacquired around potentially blocking I / O operations like reading or writing a file , so that other threads can run while the thread that requests the I / O is waiting for the I / O operation to complete . The Python interpreter needs to keep some bookkeeping information separate per thread -- for this it uses a data structure called PyThreadState . This is new in Python 1.5 ; in earlier versions , such state was stored in global variables , and switching threads could cause problems . In particular , exception handling is now thread safe , when the application uses sys . e xc_info ( ) to access the exception last raised in the current thread . There 's one global variable left , however : the pointer to the current PyThreadState structure . While most thread packages have a way to store ' ' per-thread global data , ' ' Python's internal platform independent thread abstraction does n ' t support this yet . Therefore , the current thread state must be manipulated explicitly . This is easy enough in most cases . Most code manipulating the global interpreter lock has the following simple structure : Save the thread state in a local variable . Release the interpreter lock .... Do some blocking I / O operation ... Reacquire the interpreter lock . Restore the thread state from the local variable . This is so common that a pair of macros exists to simplify it : Py_BEGIN_ALLOW_THREADS ... Do some blocking I / O operation ... Py_END_ALLOW_THREADS The Py_BEGIN_ALLOW_THREADS macro opens a new block and declares a hidden local variable ; the Py_END_ALLOW_THREADS macro closes the block . Another advantage of using these two macros is that when Python is compiled without thread support , they are defined empty , thus saving the thread state and lock manipulations . When thread support is enabled , the block above expands to the following code : PyThreadState * _save ; _save = PyEval_SaveThread ( ) ; ... Do some blocking I / O operation ... PyEval_RestoreThread ( _save ) ; Using even lower level primitives , we can get roughly the same effect as follows : PyThreadState * _save ; _save = PyThreadState_Swap ( NULL ) ; PyEval_ReleaseLock ( ) ; ... Do some blocking I / O operation ... PyEval_AcquireLock ( ) ; PyThreadState_Swap ( _save ) ; There are some subtle differences ; in particular , PyEval_RestoreThread ( ) saves and restores the value of the global variable errno , since the lock manipulation does not guarantee that errno is left alone . Also , when thread support is disabled , PyEval_SaveThread ( ) and PyEval_RestoreThread ( ) do n't manipulate the lock ; in this case , PyEval_ReleaseLock ( ) and PyEval_AcquireLock ( ) are not available . This is done so that dynamically loaded extensions compiled with thread support enabled can be loaded by an interpreter that was compiled with disabled thread support . The global interpreter lock is used to protect the pointer to the current thread state . When releasing the lock and saving the thread state , the current thread state pointer must be retrieved before the lock is released ( since another thread could immediately acquire the lock and store its own thread state in the global variable ) . Reversely , when acquiring the lock and restoring the thread state , the lock must be acquired before storing the thread state pointer . Why am I going on with so much detail about this ? Because when threads are created from C , they do n't have the global interpreter lock , nor is there a thread state data structure for them . Such threads must bootstrap themselves into existence , by first creating a thread state data structure , then acquiring the lock , and finally storing their thread state pointer , before they can start using the Python / C API . When they are done , they should reset the thread state pointer , release the lock , and finally free their thread state data structure . When creating a thread data structure , you need to provide an interpreter state data structure . The interpreter state data structure hold global data that is shared by all threads in an interpreter , for example the module administration ( sys . m odules ) . Depending on your needs , you can either create a new interpreter state data structure , or share the interpreter state data structure used by the Python main thread ( to access the latter , you must obtain the thread state and access its interp member ; this must be done by a thread that is created by Python or by the main thread after Python is initialized ) . PyInterpreterState This data structure represents the state shared by a number of cooperating threads . Threads belonging to the same interpreter share their module administration and a few other internal items . There are no public members in this structure . Threads belonging to different interpreters initially share nothing , except process state like available memory , open file descriptors and such . The global interpreter lock is also shared by all threads , regardless of to which interpreter they belong . PyThreadState This data structure represents the state of a single thread . The only public data member is PyInterpreterState * interp , which points to this thread's interpreter state . void PyEval_InitThreads ( ) Initialize and acquire the global interpreter lock . It should be called in the main thread before creating a second thread or engaging in any other thread operations such as PyEval_ReleaseLock ( ) or PyEval_ReleaseThread ( tstate ) . It is not needed before calling PyEval_SaveThread ( ) or PyEval_RestoreThread ( ) . This is a no-op when called for a second time . It is safe to call this function before calling Py_Initialize ( ) . When only the main thread exists , no lock operations are needed . This is a common situation ( most Python programs do not use threads ) , and the lock operations slow the interpreter down a bit . Therefore , the lock is not created initially . This situation is equivalent to having acquired the lock : when there is only a single thread , all object accesses are safe . Therefore , when this function initializes the lock , it also acquires it . Before the Python thread module creates a new thread , knowing that either it has the lock or the lock has n ' t been created yet , it calls PyEval_InitThreads ( ) . When this call returns , it is guaranteed that the lock has been created and that it has acquired it . It is not safe to call this function when it is unknown which thread ( if any ) currently has the global interpreter lock . This function is not available when thread support is disabled at compile time . void PyEval_AcquireLock ( ) Acquire the global interpreter lock . The lock must have been created earlier . If this thread already has the lock , a deadlock ensues . This function is not available when thread support is disabled at compile time . void PyEval_ReleaseLock ( ) Release the global interpreter lock . The lock must have been created earlier . This function is not available when thread support is disabled at compile time . void PyEval_AcquireThread ( PyThreadState * tstate ) Acquire the global interpreter lock and then set the current thread state to tstate , which should not be NULL . The lock must have been created earlier . If this thread already has the lock , deadlock ensues . This function is not available when thread support is disabled at compile time . void PyEval_ReleaseThread ( PyThreadState * tstate ) Reset the current thread state to NULL and release the global interpreter lock . The lock must have been created earlier and must be held by the current thread . The tstate argument , which must not be NULL , is only used to check that it represents the current thread state -- if it is n't , a fatal error is reported . This function is not available when thread support is disabled at compile time . PyThreadState * PyEval_SaveThread ( ) Release the interpreter lock ( if it has been created and thread support is enabled ) and reset the thread state to NULL , returning the previous thread state ( which is not NULL ) . If the lock has been created , the current thread must have acquired it . ( This function is available even when thread support is disabled at compile time . ) void PyEval_RestoreThread ( PyThreadState * tstate ) Acquire the interpreter lock ( if it has been created and thread support is enabled ) and set the thread state to tstate , which must not be NULL . If the lock has been created , the current thread must not have acquired it , otherwise deadlock ensues . ( This function is available even when thread support is disabled at compile time . ) The following macros are normally used without a trailing semicolon ; look for example usage in the Python source distribution . Py_BEGIN_ALLOW_THREADS This macro expands to "" { PyThreadState * _save ; _save = PyEval_SaveThread ( ) ; "" . Note that it contains an opening brace ; it must be matched with a following Py_END_ALLOW_THREADS macro . See above for further discussion of this macro . It is a no-op when thread support is disabled at compile time . Py_END_ALLOW_THREADS This macro expands to "" PyEval_RestoreThread ( _save ) ; } "" . Note that it contains a closing brace ; it must be matched with an earlier Py_BEGIN_ALLOW_THREADS macro . See above for further discussion of this macro . It is a no-op when thread support is disabled at compile time . Py_BEGIN_BLOCK_THREADS This macro expands to "" PyEval_RestoreThread ( _save ) ; "" i . e . it is equivalent to Py_END_ALLOW_THREADS without the closing brace . It is a no-op when thread support is disabled at compile time . Py_BEGIN_UNBLOCK_THREADS This macro expands to "" _save = PyEval_SaveThread ( ) ; "" i . e . it is equivalent to Py_BEGIN_ALLOW_THREADS without the opening brace and variable declaration . It is a no-op when thread support is disabled at compile time . All of the following functions are only available when thread support is enabled at compile time , and must be called only when the interpreter lock has been created . PyInterpreterState * PyInterpreterState_New ( ) Create a new interpreter state object . The interpreter lock need not be held , but may be held if it is necessary to serialize calls to this function . void PyInterpreterState_Clear ( PyInterpreterState * interp ) Reset all information in an interpreter state object . The interpreter lock must be held . void PyInterpreterState_Delete ( PyInterpreterState * interp ) Destroy an interpreter state object . The interpreter lock need not be held . The interpreter state must have been reset with a previous call to PyInterpreterState_Clear ( ) . PyThreadState * PyThreadState_New ( PyInterpreterState * interp ) Create a new thread state object belonging to the given interpreter object . The interpreter lock need not be held , but may be held if it is necessary to serialize calls to this function . void PyThreadState_Clear ( PyThreadState * tstate ) Reset all information in a thread state object . The interpreter lock must be held . void PyThreadState_Delete ( PyThreadState * tstate ) Destroy a thread state object . The interpreter lock need not be held . The thread state must have been reset with a previous call to PyThreadState_Clear ( ) . PyThreadState * PyThreadState_Get ( ) Return the current thread state . The interpreter lock must be held . When the current thread state is NULL , this issues a fatal error ( so that the caller need n ' t check for NULL ) . PyThreadState * PyThreadState_Swap ( PyThreadState * tstate ) Swap the current thread state with the thread state given by the argument tstate , which may be NULL .

82,A8,"Hungary : "" We Voted For Orbán , Not For Goldman Sachs "" Last Saturday , after several protests organized by citizen movements and opposition forces against the politics of the ruling Fidesz-KDNP government , Hungarians supporting those in power decided to express their opinion at a rally called Peace March . According to the Hungarian Interior Ministry's report [ hu ] , some 400,000 people expressed their support for the government at the peaceful - and cheerful - event . ' We are the Hungarian people and we stand for Orbán's government ! ' . Photo by Redjade , used with permission . Those who thought Fidesz-KDNP had lost the trust of the Hungarian citizens , drawing the consequence from the extensive foreign media coverage of the opposition protests in Budapest , were challenged this time by the fact that the government elected in 2010 with a two-thirds majority still enjoyed the support of many . Fidelitas , a youth group derived from Fidesz , shared some 360-degree panoramic photos of the march . The protesters marched from Heroes' Square to Kossuth Square by the Parliament , where brief speeches were delivered . The main organizers of the event were Zsolt Bayer , author of opinion pieces at the conservative daily Magyar Hírlap , Gábor Széles , a wealthy Hungarian entrepreneur and owner of Magyar Hírlap , and András Bencsik , editor-in-chief of Magyar Demokrata [ hu ] , also a Hungarian conservative daily . The right-leaning blog Mandiner has been very critical of the government recently , and , at first , their blogger , Dobray , who visited the Peace March , also had some doubts regarding the event [ hu ] : [ ... ] Compared to what I had anticipated , the march came off even better : the mass of 400,000 ( probably fewer than that , the protest maths [ competition of whose protest had more attendees ] was started by Bencsik at Kossuth Square when he said , referring to a television report , that they were 1 million , which was evidently an unreal figure ) walked the distance , and , as no other options were listed on the program , no lame events happened . The puritan minimalism goes hand in hand with a portion of boredom well known from the first , eventless left-wing rallies . But it 's hard to pick at that . And that there were some groups with Arpad's striped flags [ a symbol of the far right ] was not a big deal , we are used to that , they do n't do any trouble . We will worry about some Arpad stripes protesters in a mass of a couple of hundred thousands if the left wing expels from their community the comrades parading in the USSR and Che t-shirts . [ ... ] The fact that describes the complex situation in Hungary best is that the government's supporters oppose the talks and future agreements on the bailout from the EU and the IMF , while the opposition is in favor of reaching the agreements as soon as possible , in order to strengthen Hungary's volatile economy . Pro-government protesters criticized EU / ECB / IMF for pressure on the government to take more bailout loans . Photo by Redjade , used with permission . Many protesters arrived from outside the capital . The blog of the city of Ócsa wrote [ hu ] about why they considered it important to participate in the march : People set off from almost every settlement of the country to express their solidarity with the government elected with the two-thirds majority , with its leader Viktor Orbán and with everyone who has been attacked in the past days . The marchers stand up for the sovereignity of Hungary and stick to the achievements of democracy , they ca n ' t stand that foreign politicians , businessmen , banks are willing to administer their lives . [ ... ] Véleményvezér pointed out [ hu ] that most of the protesters were elderly : [ ... ] it was very striking that most of the marchers were aged 50 or older . They are the ones whose private pension savings were not taken away , almost none of them has a foreign currency loan , and the government specifically tried to support them , through measures like the one-time 8-percent pension makeup or by implementing the institution of securing employment for older persons . [ ... ] ' We voted for Orbán and not for Goldman Sachs ' . Photo by Redjade , used with permission . Dobray hints at the rumours about paid protesters and organized travel to the rally location , the accusations raised by opposition members : [ ... ] So now we are even , now really each and everyone has brought politics to the street . And it 's funny that at any sort of protest the actual side opposing the protesters tries every method to discredit the other 's event ; and tries to find those whose travel has been paid for , who were paid to come and who were cheated , etc. Everyone is generous when it 's about their protest , but if it 's about the other 's , they turn petty and suspicious . The neighbour's lawn is always wilted . I also would be happy if the Peace March did n't get listed among the ultimate arguments of Fidesz government allowing them to knock down all the opposing opinions . [ ... ] Zoltán Ruzsbaczky of Mos Maiorum blog published a guest post [ hu ] on Konzervatórium blog , noting that the huge number of the pro-government supporters may signify the arrival of a new stage of democracy in Hungary , with a lot of people daring to stand up for their opinion : [ ... ] Of course , this needs a government that applies this trust and successfully navigates the tempestuous sea of international politics and with its economic policy it sets Hungary on the track of growth . Besides this , one ca n ' t get by those masses who still oppose the politics of the government . We will learn only later what the long-term effects [ of this march ] will be , [ and whether there will be any ] . </doc>

1111,A17,"Betjeman's beautiful poems fall flat in Sand in the Sandwiches – review 2 Sand in the Sandwiches by Hugh Whitemore at the Minerva Theatre , Chichester Credit : Geraint Lewis T he sound of church bells hollowing out the sky . The beeches mellow in the evening hush . The pubs thick with curling pipe smoke . So powerfully do John Betjeman ' s pungent , perfect paeans to England imagine an entire country into being that that that you almost wonder whether , had he not written them , England would have been an entirely different place . That extraordinary myth-making ability of our best-loved Poet Laureate is reverentially honoured in Hugh Whitemore's one-man play , starring the not very Betjeman-like Edward Fox . From a sun-dappled garden bench on Fotini Dimou's simple , autumn leaf-strewn set , Betj wistfully and wittily looks back on a life that spanned a fair degree of the 20th century . Play is n't quite the right word : it 's more a stream-of-consciousness trawl through memory and verse as Fox , looking dapper in linen , reminisces on first sexual encounters , his years as an underachieving divinity undergraduate at Oxford , "" church crawling "" with WH Auden and a turbulent love life split between his amusing sounding wife Penelope and his adored mistress "" Feebles "" . Poems – lots of them – are recited in full . There 's an early showing for one of Betjeman's chilliest masterpieces , NW5 & N6 ( Highgate at Eventide ) . Edward Fox as poet laureate John Betjeman Credit : Geraint Lewis B etjeman was a highly efficient journalist : he wrote more than 1000 book reviews for The Daily Telegraph between 1951 and 1959 . His poetry , though , is the essence of nostalgia , both for his childhood ( holidays by the sea ; walks wth his father in Norfolk lanes ) , and for a vanishing England of Evensong and strapping girls playing tennis . His best works contain a fearful awareness of the numinous , but Betjeman's great skill was never to appear too serious . Fox relishes both sides of Betjeman , be it the moment his dad died at work while barely a mile away his son sat on a stalled tube train , or reciting the erotic ditty he co-wrote with Auden and MacNeice : "" Sometimes I think that I should like / To be the saddle on a bike . "" I can see exactly why audiences might embrace this poignantly observed show . But oh , I 'm sorry , I could n't love it . It 's a tall ask of any actor to deliver poem after poem in the quantities Fox has to do here . His voice has the shape of a pendulum swing , slow , heavy and ponderously rhythmic , and it leaves many poems feeling flat . Whitemore has deliberately bled anecdote into poem so that you often ca n't tell where one ends and the other begins but even for avowed Betjeman fans the effect can feel terribly monotonous . Gareth Armstrong's lifeless staging does n't help much either . The evening did , however , send me scuttling back to Betjeman's work . What a poet . And what an England . </doc>

897,A4,"Of these was Rahero sprung , a man of a godly race ; And inherited cunning of spirit and beauty of body and face . Of yore in his youth , as an aito , Rahero wandered the land , Delighting maids with his tongue , smiting men with his hand . Famous he was in his youth ; but before the midst of his life Paused , and fashioned a song of farewell to glory and strife . House of mine ( it went ) , house upon the sea , Belov 'd of all my fathers , more belov 'd by me ! Vale of the strong Honoura , deep ravine of Pai , Again in your woody summits I hear the trade-wind cry . House of mine , in your walls , strong sounds the sea , Of all sounds on earth , dearest sound to me . I have heard the applause of men , I have heard it arise and die : Sweeter now in my house I hear the trade-wind cry . These were the words of his singing , other the thought of his heart ; For secret desire of glory vexed him , dwelling apart . Lazy and crafty he was , and loved to lie in the sun , And loved the cackle of talk and the true word uttered in fun ; Lazy he was , his roof was ragged , his table was lean , And the fish swam safe in his sea , and he gathered the near and the green . He sat in his house and laughed , but he loathed the king of the land , And he uttered the grudging word under the covering hand . Treason spread from his door ; and he looked for a day to come , A day of the crowding people , a day of the summoning drum , When the vote should be taken , the king be driven forth in disgrace , And Rahero , the laughing and lazy , sit and rule in his place , Here Tamatea came , and beheld the house on the brook ; And Rahero was there by the way and covered an oven to cook . { 1c } Naked he was to the loins , but the tattoo covered the lack , And the sun and the shadow of palms dappled his muscular back . Swiftly he lifted his head at the fall of the coming feet , And the water sprang in his mouth with a sudden desire of meat ; For he marked the basket carried , covered from flies and the sun ; { 1d } And Rahero buried his fire , but the meat in his house was done . Forth he stepped ; and took , and delayed the boy , by the hand ; And vaunted the joys of meat and the ancient ways of the land : - "" Our sires of old in Taiarapu , they that created the race , Ate ever with eager hand , nor regarded season or place , Ate in the boat at the oar , on the way afoot ; and at night Arose in the midst of dreams to rummage the house for a bite . It is good for the youth in his turn to follow the way of the sire ; And behold how fitting the time ! for here do I cover my fire . "" - "" I see the fire for the cooking but never the meat to cook , "" Said Tamatea . -- "" Tut ! "" said Rahero . "" Here in the brook And there in the tumbling sea , the fishes are thick as flies , Hungry like healthy men , and like pigs for savour and size : Crayfish crowding the river , sea-fish thronging the sea . "" - "" Well it may be , "" says the other , "" and yet be nothing to me . Fain would I eat , but alas ! I have needful matter in hand , Since I carry my tribute of fish to the jealous king of the land . "" Now at the word a light sprang in Rahero's eyes . "" I will gain me a dinner , "" thought he , "" and lend the king a surprise . "" And he took the lad by the arm , as they stood by the side of the track , And smiled , and rallied , and flattered , and pushed him forward and back . It was "" You that sing like a bird , I never have heard you sing , "" And "" The lads when I was a lad were none so feared of a king . And of what account is an hour , when the heart is empty of guile ? But come , and sit in the house and laugh with the women awhile ; And I will but drop my hook , and behold ! the dinner made . "" So Tamatea the pliable hung up his fish in the shade On a tree by the side of the way ; and Rahero carried him in , Smiling as smiles the fowler when flutters the bird to the gin , And chose him a shining hook , { 1e } and viewed it with sedulous eye , And breathed and burnished it well on the brawn of his naked thigh , And set a mat for the gull , and bade him be merry and bide , Like a man concerned for his guest , and the fishing , and nothing beside . </doc>

1105,A16,"Broad Green station , Liverpool , shown in 1962 , opened in 1830 , is the oldest station site in the world still in use as a passenger station . Baker Street station , London , opened in 1863 , was the world's first station to be completely underground . Its original part , seen here , is just below the surface and was constructed by cut-and-cover tunnelling . Opened in 2006 , Berlin Hauptbahnhof is a large station at the crossing point of two major railways and features modern , abstract architecture . Berlin had a ring of terminus stations , similar to London and Paris , however they were gradually replaced with through stations from 1882 to 1952 . A train station , railway station , railroad station , or depot ( see below ) is a railway facility where trains regularly stop to load or unload passengers or freight . It generally consists of at least one track - side platform and a station building ( depot ) providing such ancillary services as ticket sales and waiting rooms . If a station is on a single-track line , it often has a passing loop to facilitate traffic movements . The smallest stations are most often referred to as "" stops "" or , in some parts of the world , as "" halts "" ( flag stops ) . Stations may be at ground level , underground , or elevated . Connections may be available to intersecting rail lines or other transport modes such as buses , trams or other rapid transit systems . In Britain and other Commonwealth countries , traditional usage favours railway station or simply station , even though train station , which is often perceived as an Americanism , is now about as common as railway station in writing ; railroad station is not used , railroad being obsolete there . [ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] In British usage , the word station is commonly understood to mean a railway station unless otherwise qualified . [ 4 ] In the United States , the most common term in contemporary usage is train station . Railway station and railroad station are less frequent . [ 5 ] In North America , the term depot is used most commonly as an alternative name for station , along with the compound forms train depot , railway depot , and railroad depot , but also applicable for buses and other vehicles , especially in rural areas where it might be understood as a direct equivalent to stop or halt . [ citation needed ] Outside of North America , a depot is "" [ a ] place where buses , trains , or other vehicles are housed and maintained and from which they are dispatched for service . "" [ 6 ] Grand Central Terminal in New York City is the world's largest station by number of platforms , having 67 tracks on two levels . The world's first recorded railway station was The Mount on the Oystermouth Railway ( later to be known as the Swansea and Mumbles ) in Swansea , Wales , [ 7 ] which began passenger service in 1807 , although the trains were horsedrawn rather than by locomotives . [ 8 ] The oldest terminal station in the world was Crown Street railway station in Liverpool , built in 1830 , on the Liverpool to Manchester line . As the first train on the Liverpool-Manchester line left Liverpool the station is slightly older than the Manchester terminal at Liverpool Road . The station was the first to incorporate a train shed . The station was demolished in 1836 as the Liverpool terminal station moved to Lime Street railway station . Crown Street station was converted to a goods station terminal . The first stations had little in the way of buildings or amenities . The first stations in the modern sense were on the Liverpool and Manchester Railway , opened in 1830 . [ 10 ] Manchester's Liverpool Road Station , the second oldest terminal station in the world , and the only surviving station , is preserved as part of the Museum of Science and Industry in Manchester . It resembles a row of Georgian houses . Early stations were sometimes built with both passenger and goods facilities , though some railway lines were goods-only or passenger-only , and if a line was dual-purpose there would often be a goods depot apart from the passenger station . [ 11 ] Dual-purpose stations can sometimes still be found today , though in many cases goods facilities are restricted to major stations . In rural and remote communities across Canada and the United States , passengers wanting to board the train had to flag the train down in order for it to stop . Such stations were known as "" flag stops "" or "" flag stations "" . [ 12 ] Many stations date from the 19th century and reflect the grandiose architecture of the time , lending prestige to the city as well as to railway operations . [ 13 ] Countries where railways arrived later may still have such architecture , as later stations often imitated 19th-century styles . Various forms of architecture have been used in the construction of stations , from those boasting grand , intricate , Baroque - or Gothic - style edifices , to plainer utilitarian or modernist styles . Stations in Europe tended to follow British designs and were in some countries , like Italy , financed by British railway companies . [ 14 ] Stations built more recently often have a similar feel to airports , with a simple , abstract style . Examples of modern stations include those on newer high-speed rail networks , such as the Shinkansen in Japan , TGV lines in France and ICE lines in Germany . Stations usually have staffed ticket sales offices , automated ticket machines , or both , although on some lines tickets are sold on board the trains . Many stations include a shop or convenience store . Larger stations usually have fast-food or restaurant facilities . In some countries , stations may also have a bar or pub . Other station facilities may include : toilets , left-luggage , lost-and-found , departures and arrivals boards , luggage carts , waiting rooms , taxi ranks , bus bays and even car parks . Larger or manned stations tend to have a greater range of facilities including also a station security office . These are usually open for travellers when there is sufficient traffic over a long enough period of time to warrant the cost . In large cities this may mean facilities available around the clock . A basic station might only have platforms , though it may still be distinguished from a halt , a stopping or halting place that may not even have platforms . In many African and South American countries , and in many places in India , stations are used as a place for public markets and other informal businesses . This is especially true on tourist routes or stations near tourist destinations . As well as providing services for passengers and loading facilities for goods , stations can sometimes have locomotive and rolling stock depots ( usually with facilities for storing and refuelling rolling stock and carrying out minor repair jobs ) . In addition to the basic configuration of a station , various features set certain types of station apart . The first is the level of the tracks . Stations are often sited where a road crosses the railway : unless the crossing is a level crossing , the road and railway will be at different levels . The platforms will often be raised or lowered relative to the station entrance : the station buildings may be on either level , or both . The other arrangement , where the station entrance and platforms are on the same level , is also common , but is perhaps rarer in urban areas , except when the station is a terminus . Elevated stations are more common , not including metro stations . Stations located at level crossings can be problematic if the train blocks the roadway while it stops , causing road traffic to wait for an extended period of time . Occasionally , a station serves two or more railway lines at differing levels . This may be due to the station's position at a point where two lines cross ( example : Berlin Hauptbahnhof ) , or may be to provide separate station capacity for two types of service , such as intercity and suburban ( examples : Paris-Gare de Lyon and Philadelphia's 30th Street Station ) , or for two different destinations . Stations may also be classified according to the layout of the platforms . Apart from single-track lines , the most basic arrangement is a pair of tracks for the two directions ; there is then a basic choice of an island platform between , or two separate platforms outside , the tracks . With more tracks , the possibilities expand . Some stations have unusual platform layouts due to space constraints of the station location , or the alignment of the tracks . Examples include staggered platforms , such as at Tutbury and Hatton railway station on the Derby – Crewe line , and curved platforms , such as Cheadle Hulme railway station on the Macclesfield to Manchester Line . Triangular stations also exist where two lines form a three-way junction and platforms are built on all three sides . In a station , there are different types of tracks to serve different purposes . A station may also have a passing loop with a loop line that comes off the straight main line and merge back to the main line on the other end by railroad switches to allow trains to pass . [ 15 ] A track with a spot at the station to board and disembark trains is called station track or house track [ 16 ] regardless of whether it is a main line or loop line . If such track is served by a platform , the track may be called platform track . A loop line without a platform which is used to allow a train to clear the main line at the station only , it is called passing track . [ 15 ] A track at the station without a platform which is used for trains to pass the station without stopping is called through track . [ 16 ] There may be other sidings at the station which are lower speed tracks for other purposes . A maintenance track or a maintenance siding , usually connected to a passing track , is used for parking maintenance equipment , trains not in service , autoracks or sleepers . A refuge track is a dead-end siding that is connected to a station track as a temporary storage of a disabled train . [ 15 ] Opened in 1830 and reached through a tunnel , Liverpool's Crown Street railway station was the first ever railway terminus . The station was demolished after only six years , being replaced by Lime Street Station in the city centre . The tunnel still exists . Opened in 1836 , Spa Road railway station in London was the city's first terminus and also the world's first elevated station and terminus . A "" terminal "" or "" terminus "" is a station at the end of a railway line . Trains arriving there have to end their journeys ( terminate ) or reverse out of the station . Depending on the layout of the station , this usually permits travellers to reach all the platforms without the need to cross any tracks – the public entrance to the station and the main reception facilities being at the far end of the platforms . Sometimes , however , the track continues for a short distance beyond the station , and terminating trains continue forwards after depositing their passengers , before either proceeding to sidings or reversing to the station to pick up departing passengers . Bondi Junction is like this . Many terminus stations have underground rapid-transit urban rail stations beneath , to transit passengers to the local city or district . A terminus is frequently , but not always , the final destination of trains arriving at the station . However a number of cities , especially in continental Europe , have a terminus as their main railway stations , and all main lines converge on this station . There may also be a bypass line , used by freight trains that do not need to stop at the main station . In such cases all trains passing through that main station must leave in the reverse direction from that of their arrival . There are several ways in which this can be accomplished : arranging for the service to be provided by a multiple-unit or push-pull train , both of which are capable of operating in either direction ; the driver simply walks to the other end of the train and takes control from the other cab ; this is increasingly the normal method in Europe ; by detaching the locomotive which brought the train into the station and then either using another track to "" run it around "" to the other end of the train , to which it then re-attaches ; attaching a second locomotive to the outbound end of the train ; or by the use of a "" wye "" , a roughly triangular arrangement of track and switches ( points ) where a train can reverse direction and back into the terminal . Some termini have a newer set of through platforms underneath ( or above , or alongside ) the terminal platforms on the main level . They are used by a cross-city extension of the main line , often for commuter trains , while the terminal platforms may serve long-distance services . Examples of underground through lines include the Thameslink platforms at St. Pancras in London , the Argyle and North Clyde lines of Glasgow's suburban rail network , the recently built Malmö City Tunnel , in Antwerp in Belgium , the RER at the Gare du Nord in Paris , and many of the numerous S-Bahn lines at terminal stations in Germany , Austria and Switzerland , such as at Zürich Hauptbahnhof . An American example of a terminal with this feature is Washington , DC ' s Union Station , where there are bay platforms on the main concourse level to serve terminating trains , and standard island platforms one level below to serve trains continuing southwards . Those tracks run in a tunnel beneath the concourse and emerge a few blocks away to cross the Potomac River into Virginia . Terminus stations in large cities are by far the biggest stations , with the largest being the Grand Central Terminal in New York City , United States . [ 17 ] Often major cities , such as London , Boston , Paris , Istanbul , Tokyo and Milan have more than one terminus , rather than routes straight through the city . Train journeys through such cities often require alternative transport ( metro , bus , taxi or ferry ) from one terminus to the other . For instance in Istanbul transfers from the Sirkeci Terminal ( the European terminus ) and the Haydarpaşa Terminal ( the Asian terminus ) traditionally required crossing the Bosphorus via alternative means , before the railway tunnel linking Europe and Asia was completed . Though some cities , including New York , have both termini and through lines . Terminals that have competing rail lines using the station frequently set up a jointly owned terminal railroad to own and operate the station and its associated tracks and switching operations . A junction is a station where two or more rail routes converge or diverge . It could be a terminus or an en-route station . During a journey , the term station stop may be used in announcements , to differentiate a halt during which passengers may alight from a halt for another reason , such as a locomotive change . A railway stop is a spot along a railway line , usually between stations or at a seldom-used station , where passengers can board and exit the train . While a junction or interlocking usually divides two or more lines or routes , and thus has remotely or locally operated signals , a station stop does not . A station stop usually does not have any tracks other than the main tracks , and may or may not have switches ( points , crossovers ) . A halt , in railway parlance in the Commonwealth of Nations and Republic of Ireland , is a small station , usually unstaffed or with very few staff , and with few or no facilities . In some cases , trains stop only on request , when passengers on the platform indicate that they wish to board , or passengers on the train inform the crew that they wish to alight . In the United Kingdom , most former halts on the national railway networks have had the word halt removed from their names . Historically , in many instances the spelling "" halte "" was used , before the spelling "" halt "" became commonplace . There are only two publicly advertised and publicly accessible National Rail stations with the word "" halt "" remaining : Coombe Junction and St Keyne Wishing Well . [ 18 ] [ 19 ] A number of other halts are still open and operational on privately owned , heritage , and preserved railways throughout the British Isles . The word is often used informally to describe national rail network stations with limited service and low usage , such as the Oxfordshire Halts on the Cotswold Line . The title halt had also sometimes been applied colloquially to stations served by public services but not available for use by the general public , being accessible only by persons travelling to / from an associated factory ( for example IBM near Greenock – although this is no longer restricted – and British Steel Redcar ) , military base ( such as Lympstone Commando ) or railway yard . The only two such remaining "" private "" stopping places on the national system where the "" halt "" designation is still officially used seem to be Staff Halt ( at Durnsford Road , Wimbledon ) and Battersea Pier Sidings Staff Halt - both are solely for railway staff and are not open to passengers . [ 19 ] The Great Western Railway in Great Britain , began opening haltes on 12 October 1903 ; from 1905 , the French spelling was Anglicised to "" halt "" . These GWR halts had the most basic facilities , with platforms long enough for just one or two carriages ; some had no platform at all , necessitating the provision of steps on the carriages . There was normally no station staff at a halt , tickets being sold on the train . On 1 September 1904 , a larger version , known on the GWR as a "" platform "" instead of a "" halt "" , was introduced ; these had longer platforms , and were usually staffed by a senior grade porter , who sold tickets , and sometimes booked parcels or milk consignments . [ 20 ] [ 21 ] From 1903 to 1947 the GWR built 379 halts and inherited a further 40 from other companies at the Grouping of 1923 . Peak building periods were before the First World War ( 145 built ) and 1928-39 ( 198 built ) [ 22 ] ) . Ten more were opened by BR on ex-GWR lines . The GWR also built 34 "" platforms "" . [ 23 ] In many Commonwealth countries the term "" halt "" is still used . In the United States such stations are traditionally referred to as flag stops . In the Republic of Ireland , a few small railway stations are designated as "" halts "" ( Irish : stadanna , sing . stad ) . [ 24 ] Accessibility for people with disabilities is mandated by law in some countries . Considerations include : elevator or ramp access to all platforms , matching platform height to train floors , making wheelchair lifts available when platforms do not match vehicle floors , accessible toilets and pay phones , audible station announcements , and safety measures such as tactile marking of platform edges . Reached by a 1 . 24-mile ( 2 km ) long tunnel , the 1830 Park Lane Goods Terminus at Liverpool's docks was the world's first station built entirely for freight . Goods or freight stations deal exclusively or predominantly with the loading and unloading of goods and may well have marshalling yards ( classification yards ) for the sorting of wagons . The world's first Goods terminal was the 1830 Park Lane Goods Station at the South End Liverpool Docks . Built in 1830 the terminal was reached by a 1 . 24-mile ( 2 km ) tunnel . As goods have been increasingly moved by road , many former goods stations , as well as the goods sheds at passenger stations , have closed . In addition , many goods stations today are used purely for the cross-loading of freight and may be known as transshipment stations . Where they primarily handle containers they are also known as container stations or terminals . Nagoya Station in Japan is the world's tallest station building . The Gare du Nord in France is Europe's busiest station . Clapham Junction , in London , United Kingdom , is the busiest station in terms of rail traffic with an average of one train every 13 seconds at peak times . The world's busiest passenger station , in terms of daily passenger throughput , is Shinjuku Station in Tokyo . [ 25 ] The station was used by an average of 3.64 million people per day in 2007 . In terms of platform capacity , the world's largest station by platforms is Grand Central Terminal in New York City with 44 platforms ; [ 28 ] as part of the East Side Access Project , the MTA will be adding 4 more platforms to accommodate future Long Island Rail Road trains .

398,A8,"HSBC may quit UK - papers 6th October From : IFA Online , 6 / 10 / 2006 9 : 44 : 00 AM It says HSBC moved its headquarters and tax domicile to the UK from Hong Kong in 1993 as a condition of its takeover of the troubled Midland bank . It pays more than £ 370m into the chancellor's coffers each year . But the international nature of its business and the jet-setting tendencies of its top executives have regularly provoked speculation about the bank's long-term plans . The bank makes no secret of the fact that it reviews the location of its head office every three years but has so far concluded it should stay in the UK , illustrated by the construction of a new tower in London's docklands . The next review is expected in six months' time and will be closely watched by international companies . In a speech last week , Chris Spooner , head of financial planning and tax at HSBC , suggested that the issue of the bank's tax domicile was back on the agenda . "" The UK used to be a good place to be for purely tax reasons , "" he said . "" I am not sure if that is the case any more . "" HSBC pays a large amount of tax and we are the ones who decide who gets it . We take the competitive environment seriously and there are others like us . "" The comments first appeared in Accountancy Age magazine after a speech given by Spooner at a Chartered Institute of Taxation conference in London . HSBC is likely to be one of the 10 biggest tax payers in the country and its tax bill is the main criterion when it decides where to be based , along with other issues such as regulation , transport and quality of life . HSBC's senior executives have not tried to hide their irritation about the regulatory environment , particularly following changes brought in after the Cruickshank review of the industry . At the bank's annual general meeting in 2002 , the then chairman Sir John Bond told shareholders of the bank's concerns that new regulations were not in their interests or those of its customers . But speculation about HSBC's intentions has escalated after last month's ruling from the European Court of Justice that seemed to clear the way for companies wanting to take advantage of lower tax rates in some EU states . In a case against Cadbury Schweppes , the European court concluded it was legal for companies to exploit tax differentials as long as the employees were carrying out real work . A number of Lloyd's of London insurance brokers have moved their domiciles recently . The European Central Bank has raised interest rates a quarter point to 3.25 % and signalled a further rise in December , despite fears that monetary overkill could smother Europe's fragile expansion and cause a sharp slide in global asset prices , reports the Telegraph . It says Jean-Claude Trichet , the ECB's president , warned of "" serious risks "" to price stability even though inflation dropped sharply to 1.8 % last month from highs of 2.5 % in June . "" Further withdrawal of monetary policy is warranted . Money and credit growth are strong and liquidity in the euro area is ample by all plausible measures , "" he said . The ECB is alarmed by property booms in Spain , Ireland and parts of France , fearing credit growth running at 11.9 % is stoking up inflationary pressures . The latest wage deals in German industry have seen rises of 3.8 % , the highest in a decade . "" We have a compass , we have a needle in our compass . It is price stability , "" Trichet said . The rate rise comes despite an increase in euro-zone unemployment to 7.9 % in August , the first move up in over four years . Joachim Fels , Morgan Stanley's credit chief , said there was a mounting risk that the ECB would over-tighten , with serious spill-over effects for the rest of the world . "" The ECB's easy stance has supported the euro economy , asset markets , and the global liquidity cycle for no less than five years , "" he said . "" The impending return to monetary neutrality in Europe may well turn out to have more dire consequences for the economy and global asset markets than generally assumed , "" he said . Fels said the shock could be similar to the effect of America's shift to "" restrictive "" rates this spring , which set off a worldwide slide in asset prices . "" A similar shiver may well go through the system once it becomes clear that the next provider of excess liquidity - the ECB - has turned off the tap , "" he said . Trichet hinted yesterday that the ECB was having to grapple with incipient stagflation "" , warning that inflation would remain stubbornly above the ECB's ceiling of 2 % well into 2007 despite "" downside "" risks to growth . Bernard Connolly , global strategist for AIG , said the ECB was in effect setting interest rate policy to head off incipient inflation in Germany , obeying an implicit contract built into Europe's monetary union that German price stability must never be sacrificed . The result is a long-term risk of "" recession , deflation and default "" for the Club Med bloc of Spain , Italy , Portugal and Greece .

632,A11,"[ Back to list of True Stories ] [ Printable Verison ] New True Story - Darren's Story ( Coverage : UK Wide ) I was addicted to motorbikes from when I was 14 years old . I 'd pinch a bike , spray it , and go scrambling on the fields . I did sports at school then , so I could run away really fast . I did n't get caught . But I could n't run anywhere a few years later , when the heroin had got me . By then I was pinching cars just to pay for my drugs . The people selling only got greedier and could squeeze me . So I had to keep stealing more and more . I 've got about 20 convictions – all for theft of , or from , motor vehicles . If I nicked a car with a baby seat , that would make me think about what I was doing . But I had to think about number one because if not then I would n't get my heroin . It 's horrible I know , looking back . But at the time , I just had to get it . I was 14 years old when I first took amphetamines . It was easy to get on our estate . A gang of about 20 kids hung round together . Some grown-ups gave us drugs for free . I only took speed then . Cannabis gave me a fuzzy head . It seemed to me that all the kids took speed . At school I was always picked for sports teams . The teacher said if I carried on I 'd be a true athlete . But I messed it up . Tragedy struck my family when my sister Carrie was killed suddenly in a road accident . Later my mum and dad split up . I felt the address we lived at was unlucky for everyone . I injected the very first time I started on heroin . The first time I was rattling [ in withdrawal ] I did n't know what it was . I was bad , I did n't want to believe it was happening to me . It 's ten times worse than the ' flu . I 'd only been taking heroin for two weeks . Some people can take it for months before it becomes a habit . Heroin feels very good when you start taking it – it 's like you 're invincible . But when it gets you , then soon you have nothing left . I 'm 26 years old now . I 've got two kids at primary school that I have n't been able to offer anything much to , or to their mum – we were childhood sweethearts . I 've known her since I was 12 years old . I 've just given them a load of grief . I 've been in and out of prison . Down to Exeter and up to Liverpool – and all the ones in between . Some you can get drugs in , others you ca n't . I 've had sentences lasting a couple of years and some just a couple of months . But I feel I 've never really had any help to get off heroin . Maybe I was n't ready – but looking back sometimes I think I was . I did get some help in prison . But I could never manage to stay clean on discharge . I 'd start again more or less the next day . People offered it for free , so I 'd get hooked and would have to start pinching cars again . I 'd do cold turkey in prison . Because I was in and out of prison , I was on and off heroin . When I started taking crack cocaine , I 'd need heroin to bring me down . I was a mess . And I ca n't get my young life back now – it 's wasted . I began thinking that I 'd be better off living in prison full time . It was a better life than outside . Once I 'd got clean of heroin in prison then my sense of humour would come back and I 'd start enjoying myself and getting on with the other people . I was mixing and felt more supported in prison . The only thing that bothered me about going into prison was the thought of the withdrawal . Other than that , prison did n't scare me , I wanted it . Last year I was sent to prison five times . I was just sick of hearing the prison officers say ' see you soon ... ' I 'd heard of the DTTO ( Drug Treatment and Testing Order ) scheme from other prisoners . They 'd said it was strict . So when I was on remand I told my Probation Officer in the prison I was sick of it all , and they put me in for a DTTO . I could have walked free from court that time , as I 'd done my time on remand . Maybe that 's the difference , I made the choice about this order . Although I was back on the heroin as soon as I left prison again , after a few weeks I was put on a methadone script . I tested positive for crack and opiates for a while . Then the tests showed that I 'd kicked the crack – it took me a couple of months , it was hard but I managed . That feels like an achievement . I still had to steal to buy my stuff for a while . Where I was living was n't helping me , I could get drugs too easily . But when I 'd come out of prison , I was on the streets , so I took what accommodation I could . A housing charity worker helped me apply to get a flat . I could n't believe it when I got somewhere decent to live . I could never even keep an appointment and now I was doing things for myself . Everyone who comes to my flat says it 's gorgeous . I got it together . My mum helped me get sorted . We looked in the paper and got things second hand . I 've got a lounge , kitchen , bedroom , bathroom and there 's a hall – so it feels spacious . I 'm paying the bills okay . Mum's doing what mums do – always thinking about me , buying me food . If it was n't for my mum I would n't be alive now , it 'd all have finished me . I love her to bits . As I reduced my heroin , I did n't have to steal , and could manage to pay out about £ 10 a week for what I needed . I 'm clean of it now . On the DTTO you have to come in every day and see people . So I 've got something to focus on . I 'm mixing with different people , who are trying to make a go of things too . My biggest support have been my family who have always said that they stuck with me because they knew what I was really like , off the heroin . I need to get my life sorted out before I become involved with the children again . It 's not good for them to be messed about with their dad coming in and out , in and out , of their little lives . I have to offer more stability . When I went back to court last time for the review I got told that my attendance on the DTTO was ' magnificent ' The staff here talk to me , I get praise and also compliments . I feel listened to and I listen to others too . I 'm having adult relationships with the staff , because of who they are and also because I 'm changing . People are n't giving up on me – I 've stuck it out and come every day . I 'm going to complete this order if it kills me ! We do loads of different things like independent living skills . I 've made a real spaghetti bolognaise and lasagne . I 've done baking and made oatcakes and baked potatoes with tuna mayonnaise . We 've done positive thinking groups and setting goals . The staff say I make good contributions . My thinking style has changed . I just got burgled and although I had a brief relapse I 'm back giving negative tests . I 'm trying to deal with it as an adult now . And anyway , I 've stolen enough times from other people , so what 's gone round has come round . So I 'm the victim now . We 've done team exercises at an outdoor pursuits centre – which was great . I 've really enjoyed doing an arts project with the local college . We went to college and did a health and safety exam , we all passed and got certificates . I even go out at weekends again . It feels good to have a social life again . I am thinking about the future and work . With my knowledge of cars I could maybe be a mechanic . Although I do n't know why , I 've always wanted to be a milkman . </doc>

239,A1,"Forty-ninth session Geneva , 7-18 October 2002 Item 2 of the provisional agenda HOW CAN THE POST-DOHA PROCESS WORK BEST FOR DEVELOPMENT ? Background note by the UNCTAD secretariat Executive summary This background note raises a number of questions that might usefully be considered in relation to the treatment of development-related concerns in the post-Doha work programme of the World Trade Organization . Apart from broader issues such as the ongoing concerns of developing countries about implementation of the results of the Uruguay Round and special and differential treatment for developing countries , the note touches on selected issues from a number of areas of work covered by the WTO Ministerial Declaration , examing these from a development perspective . The note should be read in conjunction with the document "" Developments and Issues in the Post-Doha Work Programme of Particular Concern to Developing Countries "" ( TD / B / 49 / 12 ) , which contains additional considerations regarding the content and overall context of the post-Doha process . Introduction Development issues have been at the forefront of debate in the World Trade Organization for the last several years . The need to address these concerns was recognized at the WTO Fourth Ministerial Meeting in Doha in November 2001 , leading to a Ministerial Declaration and other decisions by Ministers that constitute a work programme with important development components . In many respects the post-Doha work programme offers important opportunities to promote development - but is a development-friendly outcome guaranteed ? How successful will the Doha texts be in re-orienting the WTO system towards development ? How is special and differential treatment ( SDT ) being implemented in the current work programme ? Are there any indications of how SDT is to be implemented in the outcome of the negotiations ? What progress has been made towards giving SDT a more secure legal base ? How can SDT provisions be reconciled with the concept of a "" Single Undertaking "" ? The Doha Declaration contains frequent references to technical assistance for developing countries , and technical cooperation and capacity-building are confirmed as "" core elements of the development dimension of the multilateral trading system "" . Are there sufficient resources to execute all the technical cooperation activities envisaged in the post-Doha work programme ? What role can other agencies , in particular UNCTAD , play in providing technical cooperation and capacity-building to developing countries in the current negotiations ? What is the appropriate balance between such support for developing countries in WTO negotiations , as well as other trade policy development and administration ( including within the context of the Integrated Framework ) and support for negotiations and building supply capacity in developing countries ? In a number of areas , such as investment , competition policy , government procurement and trade facilitation , provision is made for negotiations to take place after the Fifth Session of the Ministerial Conference on the basis of a decision to be taken , by explicit consensus , at that session on modalities of negotiations . What exactly does explicit consensus mean ? What progress is being made on such issues ? A number of areas , such as electronic commerce , trade , debt and finance , and trade and the transfer of technology are also an integral part of the post-Doha work programme ; work in these areas is important for ensuring an effective link between trade and development . A report is to be made to the Fifth Ministerial Session on the desirability of possible negotiations on certain aspects of trade and environment ( while other aspects are already subject to negotiation ) . What progress has been made in these areas ? Overall , what progress is being made in the WTO's post-Doha work programme from a development perspective ? What needs to be achieved before the Fifth Ministerial Session from a development perspective ? Implementation of the results of the Uruguay Round How are developing countries' concerns about implementation of the results of the Uruguay Round being met - for example , in relation to transition periods and technical assistance ? Can the liberalization targets - for example , for textiles and clothing - be met on schedule without being negated by alternative protectionist measures ? How are "" best endeavours "" clauses to take account of developing-country interests being implemented ? The post-Doha work programme holds out hope for gains by developing countries , but it may also be expected to lead to further commitments . What are the perceived gains , and how do they compare with the expected costs of implementation ? Is it reasonable or feasible to ask developing countries to take on new commitments at this stage ? Are developing countries capable of fully meeting the commitments from the Uruguay Round and at the same time starting a new trade negotiations round ? What can be done to strengthen their capacity ? Selected Issues covered by the Doha MInisterial Declaration Agriculture The Doha document provides that trade and non-trade concerns should be taken into account in the agriculture negotiations . Special and differential treatment ( SDT ) for developing countries is to be an integral part of all elements of the negotiations . How are conflicting objectives to be reconciled ? What are the prospects for a "" development box "" ? How can the interests of developing net food-exporters countries and net food-importing countries be made compatible ? Industrial products Negotiations on market access for industrial goods are aimed at reducing or eliminating tariff peaks , tariff escalation and non-tariff measures affecting all products , and in particular products of interest to developing countries . What should be the targets ( average cuts ) and modalities ( e . g . formulas or request and offer ) ? What transition periods should be allowed ? To what extent might developing countries have to make concessions that could limit their scope for industrial development programmes ? How can the Doha mandate on less than full reciprocity by developing countries in non-agricultural negotiations be given effect , as established in GATT Article XXVIII bis ? How can concerns about the erosion of preferences be addressed , and what kinds of development-oriented measures could be envisaged to compensate for that erosion ? How are non-tariff measures , including rules of origin , being handled ? Services In the GATS , how can Article IV on increasing participation by developing countries be operationalized ? What is being done to overcome obstacles to the liberalization of sectors or modes of supply of particular export interest to developing countries ? How can the negotiations ensure that national objectives for essential services are met ? How can it be ensured that disciplines on domestic regulation will not compromise developing countries' flexibility to establish an appropriate regulatory framework ? What disciplines on subsidies would limit trade-distorting subsidies while providing for flexibility in relation to the development programmes of developing countries ? How can credit be granted for autonomous liberalization ? Trade-Related Intellectual Property Rights ( TRIPS ) The Doha Ministerial Declaration stresses the importance of protecting intellectual property rights while promoting access to existing medicines . How is it possible to provide incentives for research and , at the same time , give developing countries and least developed countries ( LDCs ) access to essential medicines ? The Doha Decisions reaffirmed that the provisions of Article 66.2 of the TRIPS Agreement are mandatory . What measures can promote the transfer of technology to developing countries ? Trade and environment At the recent World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg , the importance of achieving a sustainable model of development was emphasized . Consequently , linkages between trade and environment are expected to become more important . Will the outcome of the Johannesburg meeting affect the balance between environmental protection and the need to provide developing countries flexibility in achieving their development objectives ? How can synergies be promoted between environmental protection , economic development and trade ? Trade and investment In paragraph 20 of the Doha Ministerial Declaration , the importance of ensuring secure and predictable conditions for investment is underlined . However , paragraph 22 recognizes the importance of reflecting in a balanced manner the interests of home and host countries , paying attention to development policies and objectives as well as the countries' right to regulate in the public interest . How can these two objectives be balanced ? In order to facilitate the use of legal investment measures and to provide guidelines for the use of measures for national development purposes , how can developing countries ensure that FDI promotion can be achieved while not causing disturbance to trade ? Trade and competition policy The following questions have been discussed in relation to trade and competition policy : What could a multilateral framework on competition ( MFC ) achieve that could not be achieved through a domestic competition law complemented as appropriate and feasible by bilateral or regional agreements as well as by a non-binding instrument such as the Set ? Is a MFC feasible , given the great disparities in countries' market structures , economic development , institutional capacities and experiences in this area ? How could the development dimension best be catered to within a MFC ? What would be the relationship between a WTO-based MFC and other multilateral rules in this area , including existing WTO-based rules ) ? How would compliance with an MFC be verified or enforced ? Least-developed countries The Ministerial Declaration recognized "" that the integration of the LDCs into the multilateral trading system requires meaningful market access , support for the diversification of their production and export base , and trade-related technical assistance and capacity building "" . What has been done , and what can be done in the context of the post-Doha work programme in respect of these three priority areas ? Furthermore , how can negotiations with acceding LDCs be facilitated and accelerated ? Small economies How can the integration of small economies into international trade be promoted , taking into account the associated trade difficulties and investment difficulties ? </doc>

355,A17,"Nathan Cooke is that boy , he likes music and draws on his bag in biro . He should be in Glastonbury discovering women , but is in fact on holiday with his mother against his will . To exact his revenge on her for keeping him from possibly kissing a girl for a first time he takes a vow to only speak in Pulp lyrics ... it works . YouTube teaser Review In Pulp Boy , young storyteller-stroke-stand-up Terry Saunders imagines a typically moody teenager who vows , for a while , only to speak in the lyrics Jarvis Cocker made famous . Under the lad's bizarre logic , it 's a way of tackling the feelings of being displaced , misunderstood and unloved and a rebellion of sorts against his killjoy mother who 's dragging him on a budget break to Spain while he 'd much rather be going to Glastonbury with his pals . While his self-imposed affliction could lead him to ridicule , it also leads him to the first flushes of love , sparking a holiday romance with a girl equally enamoured with the band . Saunders's touching tale which he reads unapologetically from a printout is remarkable in the way he captures the feelings of being lost and alone when 15 , combining the certainty that you know all with the frustration the rest of the world does n ' t see it , for a reason beyond your comprehension . Our protagonist is at once romantic and crassly unsympathetic , seeing himself as a complex not contradictory . Saunders excels at recreating that maelstrom of conflicting emotions , speaking in the authentic tone of a defiant but confused young man . Pulp Boy is wonderfully written , poignant and quirky . It 's not a side-splitting romp , nor is it intended to be , but there are plenty of moments of rich humour , mostly in the struggle to find just the right lyric for the occasion . This is a fulfilling , grown-up piece of comedic artistry , warm , sincere and worthy of a wider audience . Steve Bennett Leicester Comedy Festival , February 2006 Your comments Terry is developing a great line in lovely , low-key whimsy , which really comes through in this show . Totally recommended .

More often than not , master chymists eventually become their mutagenic form , and the original alchemist's body and mind may only be brought forth when required by social custom or a need for obscurity and stealth arises . Unfortunately , the mutagenic form of a master chymist is often a more violent , unforgiving personality ( which can lead to conflict between the two versions of the same character ) . Role : Master chymists are rarely accepted by society once their nature is revealed , and thus they have a strong motivation to keep on the move . Adventuring is one of the few activities that their monstrous form can be useful for , leading many to constantly explore dangerous areas on the edge of civilization . A master chymist's resilience and ability to combine bomb-throwing mayhem with up-close melee carnage is a great benefit to many adventuring parties , buying the master chymist allies who are at least willing to overlook her more distasteful features . Alignment : A master chymist actually has two alignments ( see the mutagenic form ability ) . The only restriction on these alignments is that they can not be exactly the same . Extracts per Day At the indicated levels , a master chymist gains new extracts per day as if she had also gained a level in alchemist . She does not , however , gain other benefits a character of that class would have gained , except for extracts per day and an increased effective caster level for extracts . Bomb-Thrower ( Ex ) The destructive power of bombs appeals to the violent urges of a master chymist . Add the character's alchemist and master chymist levels together to determine the damage done by her bombs . Mutagenic Form ( Ex ) A master chymist's mutagenic form is an alter ego that has a different personality than her normal form , an outgrowth of the mental changes caused by the mutagenic potions she has consumed over the course of her career . The mutagenic form shares memories and basic goals with the chymist's normal personality but goes about meeting those goals in a different manner . The mutagenic form is often ugly and monstrous and may even appear to be a different race or gender than her normal form ; they may look as different as two unrelated people . Indeed , the mutagenic form often has his or her own name , and may attempt to maintain independent relationships and strongholds ( though the alter ego's limited time in existence often makes this difficult ) . The mutagenic form even has his or her own alignment ( which is selected by the player , but must be different from the master chymist's normal alignment ) . The change in alignment only affects the master chymist while in her mutagenic form . Example : Darabont is a neutral good gnome alchemist 7 / master chymist 4 . Her mutagenic form is a deformed , twisted creature called Butcher . Butcher is neutral , and more interested in seeing the world kept in balance than promoting the greatest good . Butcher is aware she exists only when called on by Darabont , but seeks to build her own circle of like-minded friends during the hours she exists . Butcher does not dislike Darabont , but feels her gnome form is too soft and innocent to survive in the harsh world the chymist lives in . As Darabont , the character detects as good and is affected as a good character by spells with effects that vary by alignment ; as Butcher , the same character is neutral , is not revealed by a detect good spell , and is treated as neutral for all spells and effects . Mutate ( Su ) At 1st level , as a result of repeated exposure to her mutagens , the master chymist can now assume a mutagenic form twice per day without imbibing her mutagen . In this form , she gains all the bonuses and penalties of her mutagen and adds together her alchemist and master chymist levels together to determine her effective alchemist level for the duration of this form . Using a mutagen also forces the chymist into this form . Taking a mutagen or using the mutate ability again while in her mutagenic form works normally ( with the new mutagen's modifiers replacing the current modifiers , and the longer duration taking precedent ) . The chymist remains in her mutagenic form until its duration expires , her magic is interrupted ( as with an antimagic field ) , or she expends another use of her mutate ability . A chymist may be forced to take her mutagenic form against her will by stress or damage . Anytime the character is in her normal form and has daily uses of the mutate ability available , she may be forced to switch after suffering a critical hit or failing a Fortitude save . In these situations the chymist must make a DC 25 Will save ; if she fails , on her next turn she uses a standard action to change to her mutagenic form ( which counts as a use of the mutate ability ) . Advanced Mutagen ( Su ) At 2nd level , the mutagenic form of the master chymist continues to evolve and develop as she grows in power . The master chymist selects an advanced mutagen , a power that changes how her mutagen form works or can only be accessed in her mutagenic form . She gains additional advanced mutagens at 4th , 6th , 8th , and 10th level . The chymist can not select the same advanced mutagen more than once . Burly ( Ex ) : In her mutagenic form , the master chymist's heavy physical frame gives her an alchemical bonus on Strength checks , Constitution checks , and Strength-based skill checks as well as a bonus to CMB and CMD . The bonus is equal to half the master chymist's class level . Disguise ( Ex ) : When in her mutagenic form , the chymist can temporarily change her appearance to her normal form and still retain most of the abilities of her mutagenic form . As a standard action , she may make a Will saving throw ( DC 20 ) to assume the appearance of her normal form for one minute . Each additional minute beyond the first requires a new saving throw with a +1 increase to the DC . Failure means the chymist assumes her normal form ( as if ending the use of mutagenic form ) or reverts fully to her mutagenic form . At any time while using this ability , the chymist can resume her normal form as a standard action or relax her will and revert to her mutagenic form as a free action . Once this ability ends , the chymist can not use it again until 10 minutes have passed . Obvious physical changes in mutagenic form such as draconic mutagen , feral mutagen , and growth mutagen do not work while the chymist is disguised in her normal form . Time spent disguised counts toward the chymist's time in her mutagenic form . Draconic Mutagen ( Su ) : When the chymist assumes her mutagenic form , she gains dragon-like features – scaly skin , reptilian eyes , and so on , resembling a halfdragon . The chymist chooses one dragon type ( see the draconic bloodline ) when selecting this advanced mutagen ; once selected , this choice can not be changed and determines her draconic resistances and breath weapon type . The chymist gains resistance 20 to the dragon's energy type . The chymist's breath weapon deals 8d8 points of energy damage ( Reflex half , DC 10 + the chymist's class level + the chymist's Intelligence modifier ) ; she may use her breath weapon once per transformation into her mutagenic form . The character must have an effective alchemist level ( alchemist level plus master chymist levels ) of at least 16 , must know the form of the dragon I extract , and must have the feral mutagen discovery or advanced mutagen to select this ability . Dual Mind ( Ex ) : The chymist's alter ego gives her a +2 bonus on Will saving throws in her normal and mutagenic forms . If she is affected by an enchantment spell or effect and fails her saving throw , she can attempt it again 1 round later at the same DC ; if she succeeds , she is free of the effect ( as if she had made her original save ) and immediately changes to her mutagenic form or back to her normal form . If she has no more uses of the mutate ability remaining for the day , she can not use dual mind . The character must have an effective alchemist level ( alchemist level plus master chymist levels ) of at least 10 to select this ability . Evasion ( Ex ) : This mutagen functions as the rogue ability of the same name , except that it only applies in the chymist's mutagenic form . Extended Mutagen ( Ex ) : The duration of the master chymist's mutation is doubled . Feral Mutagen ( Ex ) : This mutagen is identical to the alchemist discovery of the same name and counts as that discovery for the purpose of qualifying for other discoveries or advanced mutagens . Furious Mutagen ( Ex ) : The damage dice for the feral mutagen's bite and claw attacks increase by one die step . The character must have an effective alchemist level ( alchemist level plus chymist level ) of at least 11 and must have the feral mutagen discovery or advanced mutagen to select this ability . Nimble ( Ex ) : The master chymist's lithe physical frame gives her an alchemical bonus on all Dexterity checks , Dexterity skill checks , and CMD , and a natural armor bonus to her Armor Class . The bonus is equal to half the master chymist's class level . Scent ( Ex ) : The master chymist gains the scent ability in her mutagenic form . Brutality ( Ex ) At 3rd level , a master chymist's taste for violence leads her to strike more powerful blows with weapons easily mastered by her bestial mind . At 3rd level , a chymist in her mutagenic form deals +2 damage when attacking with simple weapons and natural attacks . This bonus increases to +4 at 7th level and to +6 at 9th level . </doc>

924,A4,"A Gladsome Meeting . Some hours before dawn Robin Gore came to an abrupt pause , and looking over his shoulder , held up his hand to command silence . Then he pointed to a small mound , on the top of which a faint glow of light was seen falling on the boughs of the shrubs with which it was crowned . The moon had just set , but there was sufficient light left to render surrounding objects pretty distinct . "" That 's them , "" said Robin to Walter , in a low whisper , as the latter came close to his side ; "" no doubt they 're sound asleep , an ' I 'm puzzled how to wake ' em up without givin ' ' em a fright . "" "" Musha ! it 's a fright that Wapaw will give us , av we start him suddenly , for he 's murtherin ' quick wi ' his rifle , "" whispered Larry . "" We 'd better hide and then give a howl , "" suggested Stiff , "" an ' , after they 're sot up , bring ' em down with a familiar hail . "" The deliberations of the party were out short and rendered unnecessary , however , by Wapaw himself . That sharp-eared red man had been startled by the breaking of a branch which Larry O ' Dowd chanced to set his foot on , and , before Robin had observed their fire , he had roused Roy and Nelly and hurried with them to the summit of a rocky eminence , from which stronghold they now anxiously watched the proceedings of the hunters . The spot to which they had fled for refuge was almost impregnable , and might have been held for hours by a couple of resolute men against a host of savages . Robin , after a little further consultation , resolved to send the Black Swan in advance to reconnoitre . This he did , contrary to his wonted custom of taking the lead in everything , because of an unaccountable feeling of dread lest he should not find his children there . Black Swan at once stepped cautiously forward with his rifle , ready cocked , in the hollow of his left arm , and his finger on the trigger-guard . Step by step he moved towards the encampment without making the slightest noise , and with so little motion that he might easily have been mistaken for a dark shadow . Raising his head over the edge of the encampment he gazed earnestly into it , then he advanced another pace or two , finally he stepped into it , and , standing erect , looked around him . With a wave of his hand he summoned his comrades to advance . Robin Gore's heart beat hard as he approached , followed by the others . Meanwhile they were closely watched by Roy and Wapaw . When the Black Swan's head appeared , Roy exclaimed in a whisper , "" An Injun--d ' ye know him , Wapaw ? "" "" He is one of our tribe , I think , "" replied the Indian , in the same low voice , "" but I know him not ; the light of the fire is not strong . "" "" If he 's one o ' your tribe , "" said Roy , "" it 's all up with us , for they wo n't be long o ' findin ' us here . Keep close to me , Nell . I 'll stick by you , lass , do n't fear . "" Wapaw's brows lowered when he saw the Black Swan step into the encampment , and make the signal to his comrades to advance . He raised his rifle , and took deliberate aim at his heart . "" Roy , "" he whispered , "" get an arrow ready , aim at the next man that steps into the light and let fly ; I 'll not fire till after you , for the smoke would blind you . "" Roy obeyed with a trembling hand . Notwithstanding the rough life he had led in those wild woods of the West , he had never yet been called on to lift his hand against a human being , and the thought of taking life in this deliberate and almost murderous way caused him to shudder ; still he felt that their case was desperate , and he nerved himself to the deed . Another moment , and Robin stood beside the Black Swan . Roy tried to raise his bow , but his heart failed him . Wapaw glanced at him , and said sternly -- "" Shoot first . "" At that moment Obadiah Stiff stepped into the encampment , and , stirring the embers of the fire with a piece of stick , caused a bright flame and showers of sparks to shoot upwards . This revealed the fact that some of the party were white men , so Wapaw lowered his rifle . A single glance of his practised eye told him who they were . Laying his hand suddenly and heavily on Roy's shoulder he pressed him down . "" Come , let us go , "" he said quickly ; "" I must see these men alone , and you must keep close--you must not look . "" He said the latter words with emphasis ; but in order to make sure that they should not have a chance of looking , he led his young companions to a point whence the encampment could not be seen , and left them there with strict injunctions not to quit the spot until he should return . In a few seconds Wapaw stepped into the circle of light where Robin and his party were all assembled , and so rapid and noiseless had his movement been , that he was in the midst of them almost before they were aware of his approach . "" Wapaw ! "" exclaimed Walter in surprise , "" why , you seem to have dropped from the clouds . "" "" Sure it 's a ghost ye must be , "" cried Larry . The Indian took no notice of these remarks , but turned to Robin , who , with a look of deep anxiety , said -- "" Have ' ee seed the childer , Wapaw ? "" "" They are safe , "" answered the Indian . "" Thank God for that ! "" cried Robin , while a sigh of relief burst from him : "" I believe ye , Wapaw , yer a true man an ' would n't tell me a lie , would ye ? "" The tone in which the hunter said this implied that the statement was scarcely a true index to his feelings , and that he would be glad to hear Wapaw assure him that he was indeed telling the truth . But this Indian was a man of truthfulness , and did not deem it necessary to repeat his assertion . He said , however , that he would go and fetch the children , and immediately quitted the camp . Soon after he returned with Roy and Nelly ; he had not told them , however , who the strangers were . When Roy first caught sight of his father he gave a shout of surprise , and stood still as if he were bewildered . Nelly uttered a wild scream , and rushed forward with outstretched arms . Robin met her more than half way , and the next moment folded his long-lost little one to his bosom . | Next chapter | | Previous chapter | | Contents | Created from a nineteenth or early twentieth century text by Athelstane E-Texts </doc>

986,A8,"Councils will not slow down despite recycling target capping 15 December 2004 High-performing councils have said they will not be slowing down their recycling efforts even though the government has capped all recycling targets at 30 % . Concern had been expressed this week that high-performing councils might ease off their recycling efforts because Defra decided to limit recycling targets for 2005 / 06 . Just over 100 English councils had been set household waste recycling targets of 30 % or higher before Defra's ruling late last week . But many of the high-performing councils have said that they will still aim to reach the 30 % mark or higher . Some authorities believe that Defra's decision may have been taken to win pre-election favour by limiting pressure on the Council Tax . They feel that recycling targets will go up again after an election . Other reasons given by the councils for not slowing their recycling included forthcoming Landfill Allowance Trading Scheme targets , recycling grants provided by Defra and the importance of maintaining public motivation for recycling . Several councils stated that , due to the increase in waste produced by their residents , they were unlikely to achieve the original targets , and some said 30 % was still too high . In total 103 councils are affected by the recycling cap , with those such as Daventry and Lichfield district councils already achieving household waste recycling rates above 40 % . © letsrecycle.com 2004 .

931,A4,""" It means murder , "" said he , stooping over the dead man . "" Ah , I expected it . Look here ! "" He pointed to what looked like a long , dark thorn stuck in the skin just above the ear . "" It looks like a thorn , "" said I. "" It is a thorn . You may pick it out . But be careful , for it is poisoned . "" I took it up between my finger and thumb . It came away from the skin so readily that hardly any mark was left behind . One tiny speck of blood showed where the puncture had been . "" This is all an insoluble mystery to me , "" said I. "" It grows darker instead of clearer . "" "" On the contrary , "" he answered , "" it clears every instant . I only require a few missing links to have an entirely connected case . "" We had almost forgotten our companion's presence since we entered the chamber . He was still standing in the door-way , the very picture of terror , wringing his hands and moaning to himself . Suddenly , however , he broke out into a sharp , querulous cry . "" The treasure is gone ! "" he said . "" They have robbed him of the treasure ! There is the hole through which we lowered it . I helped him to do it ! I was the last person who saw him ! I left him here last night , and I heard him lock the door as I came down-stairs . "" "" What time was that ? "" "" It was ten o ' clock . And now he is dead , and the police will be called in , and I shall be suspected of having had a hand in it . Oh , yes , I am sure I shall . But you do n't think so , gentlemen ? Surely you do n't think that it was I ? Is it likely that I would have brought you here if it were I ? Oh , dear ! oh , dear ! I know that I shall go mad ! "" He jerked his arms and stamped his feet in a kind of convulsive frenzy . "" You have no reason for fear , Mr. Sholto , "" said Holmes , kindly , putting his hand upon his shoulder . "" Take my advice , and drive down to the station to report this matter to the police . Offer to assist them in every way . We shall wait here until your return . "" The little man obeyed in a half-stupefied fashion , and we heard him stumbling down the stairs in the dark . Chapter VI Sherlock Holmes Gives a Demonstration "" Now , Watson , "" said Holmes , rubbing his hands , "" we have half an hour to ourselves . Let us make good use of it . My case is , as I have told you , almost complete ; but we must not err on the side of over-confidence . Simple as the case seems now , there may be something deeper underlying it . "" "" Simple ! "" I ejaculated . "" Surely , "" said he , with something of the air of a clinical professor expounding to his class . "" Just sit in the corner there , that your footprints may not complicate matters . Now to work ! In the first place , how did these folk come , and how did they go ? The door has not been opened since last night . How of the window ? "" He carried the lamp across to it , muttering his observations aloud the while , but addressing them to himself rather than to me . "" Window is snibbed on the inner side . Framework is solid . No hinges at the side . Let us open it . No water-pipe near . Roof quite out of reach . Yet a man has mounted by the window . It rained a little last night . Here is the print of a foot in mould upon the sill . And here is a circular muddy mark , and here again upon the floor , and here again by the table . See here , Watson ! This is really a very pretty demonstration . "" I looked at the round , well-defined muddy discs . "" This is not a footmark , "" said I. "" It is something much more valuable to us . It is the impression of a wooden stump . You see here on the sill is the boot-mark , a heavy boot with the broad metal heel , and beside it is the mark of the timber-toe . "" "" It is the wooden-legged man . "" "" Quite so . But there has been some one else , -- a very able and efficient ally . Could you scale that wall , doctor ? "" I looked out of the open window . The moon still shone brightly on that angle of the house . We were a good sixty feet from the round , and , look where I would , I could see no foothold , nor as much as a crevice in the brick-work . "" It is absolutely impossible , "" I answered . </doc>

1641,A16,"When describing the motion of objects in terms of distance , time , and direction , physicists use the basic quantities of speed and velocity . Two terms , two distinct meanings . Yet , not uncommonly , we hear these terms used interchangeably . So , what 's the difference ? Why is it incorrect to use the terms speed and velocity interchangeably ? The reason is simple . Speed is the time rate at which an object is moving along a path , while velocity is the rate and direction of an object's movement . Put another way , speed is a scalar value , while velocity is a vector . For example , 50 km / hr ( 31 mph ) describes the speed at which a car is traveling along a road , while 50 km / hr west describes the velocity at which it is traveling . The mathematical calculation for speed is relatively straightforward , wherein the average speed of an object is calculated by dividing the distance traveled by the time it took the object to travel the distance . Velocity , on the other hand , is more complicated mathematically and can be calculated in different ways , depending on what information is available about the object's motion . In its simplest form , average velocity is calculated by dividing change in position ( Δr ) by change in time ( Δt ) . </doc>

166,A1,"Hey , I am Michael Shermer , the director of the Skeptics Society , the publisher of Skeptic magazine . We investigate claims of the paranormal , pseudo-science , and fringe groups and cults and claims of all kinds between -- science and pseudo-science and non-science and junk science , voodoo science , pathological science , bad science , non-science and plain old nonsense . And unless you 've been on Mars recently , you know there 's a lot of that out there . Some people call us debunkers , which is kind of a negative term . But let 's face it -- there 's a lot of bunk , and we are like the bunko squads of the police departments out there , flushing out . Well , we 're sort of like the Ralph Naders of bad ideas -- ( Laughter ) -- trying to replace bad ideas with good ideas . I 'll show you an example of a bad idea . I brought this with me . This was given to us by NBC Dateline to test . It 's the -- it 's produced by the Quadro Corporation of West Virginia . It 's called the Quadro 2000 Dowser Rod . ( Laughter ) This was being sold to high school administrators for 900 dollars a piece . It 's a piece of plastic with a Radio Shack antenna attached to it . You could dowse for all sorts of things , but this particular one was built to dowse for marijuana in students' lockers . ( Laughter ) So the way it works is , you go down the hallway and you see if it tilts toward a particular locker , and then you open the locker . So it looks something like this . I 'll show you . ( Laughter ) No , it -- well , it has kind of a right-leaning bias . So , I 'll show -- well , this is science , so we 'll do a controlled experiment . It 'll go this way for sure . ( Laughter ) Sir , you want to empty your pockets . Please , sir ? ( Laughter ) So the question was , can it actually find marijuana in students' lockers ? And the answer is , If you open enough of them -- yes . ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) But in science , we have to keep track of the misses , not just the hits . And that 's probably the key lesson to my short talk here , is that this is how psychics work , astrologers , and tarot card readers and so on . People remember the hits ; they forget the misses . In science we have to keep the whole database , and look to see if the number of hits is somehow stands out from the total number that you would expect by chance . In this case , we tested it . We had two opaque boxes , one with government-approved THC marijuana , and one with nothing . And it got it 50 percent of the time -- -- which is exactly what you 'd expect with a coin flip model . So that 's just a fun little example here of the sorts of things we do . Skeptic is the quarterly publication . Each one has a particular theme , like this one is on the future of intelligence . Are people getting smarter or dumber ? I have an opinion of this myself because the business I 'm in . But , in fact , people , it turns out , are getting smarter . Three IQ points per 10 years , going up . Sort of an interesting thing . With science , do n't think of skepticism as a thing or even science as a thing . Are science and religion compatible ? It 's like , are science and plumbing compatible ? These -- they 're just two different things . Science is not a thing . It 's a verb . It 's a way of thinking about things . It 's a way of looking for natural explanations for all phenomena . I mean , what 's more likely -- that extraterrestrial intelligences or multi-dimensional beings travel across the vast distances of interstellar space to leave a crop circle in Farmer Bob's field in Puckerbrush , Kansas to promote skeptic . com , our webpage ? Or is it more likely that a reader of Skeptic did this with Photoshop ? And in all cases we have to ask -- ( Laughter ) -- what 's the more likely explanation ? And before we say something is out of this world , we should first make sure that it 's not in this world . What 's more likely -- that Arnold had a little extraterrestrial help in his run for the governorship ? Or that the World Weekly News makes stuff up ? ( Laughter ) And part of that -- the same theme is expressed nicely here in this Sidney Harris cartoon . For those of you in the back , it says here "" Then a miracle occurs . I think you need to be more explicit here in step two . "" This single slide completely dismantles the intelligent design arguments . There 's nothing more to it than that . ( Applause ) You can say a miracle occurs . It 's just that it does n ' t explain anything . It does n ' t offer anything . There 's nothing to test . It 's the end of the conversation for intelligent design creationists . Whereas -- and it 's true , scientists sometimes throw terms out as linguistic place fillers -- dark energy or dark matter or something like that . Until we figure out what it is , we 'll just call it this . It 's the beginning of the causal chain for science . For intelligent design creationists , it 's the end of the chain . So again , we can ask this -- what 's more likely -- are UFOs alien spaceships or perceptual cognitive mistakes , or even fakes ? This is a UFO shot from my house in Altadena , California , looking down over Pasadena . And if it looks a lot like a Buick hubcap , it 's because it is . You do n't even need Photoshop , you do n't need high-tech equipment , you do n't need computers . This was shot with a throw-away Kodak Instamatic camera . You just have somebody off on the side with a hubcap ready to go . Camera 's ready -- that 's it . ( Laughter ) So , although it 's possible that most of these things are fake or illusions or so on and that some of them are real , it 's more likely that all of them are fake , like the crop circles . On a more serious note , in all of science we 're looking for a balance between data and theory . In the case of Galileo , he had two problems when he turned his telescope to Saturn . First of all , there was no theory of planetary rings . And second of all , his data was grainy and fuzzy , and he could n ' t quite make out what it was he was looking at . So he wrote that he had seen -- "" I have observed that the furthest planet has three bodies . "" And this is what he ended up concluding that he saw . So without a theory of planetary rings and with only grainy data , you ca n ' t have a good theory . And it was n ' t solved until 1655 . This is Christiaan Huygens's book in which he cataloged all the mistakes that people made in trying to figure out what was going on with Saturn . It was n ' t till -- Huygens had two things . He had a good theory of planetary rings and how the solar system operated . And then , he had better telescopic , more fine-grain data in which he could figure out that as the Earth is going around faster -- according to Kepler's Laws -- than Saturn , then we catch up with it . And we see the angles of the rings at different angles , there . And that , in fact , turns out to be true . The problems with having a theory is that your theory may be loaded with cognitive biases . So one of the problems of explaining why people believe weird things is that we have things on a simple level . And then I 'll go to more serious ones . Like , we have a tendency to see faces . This is the face on Mars which was -- in 1976 , where there was a whole movement to get NASA to photograph that area because people thought this was monumental architecture made by Martians . Well , it turns out -- here 's the close-up of it from 2001 . If you squint , you can still see the face . And when you 're squinting , what you 're doing is you 're turning that from fine-grain to coarse-grain . And so , you 're reducing the quality of your data . And if I did n't tell you what to look for , you 'd still see the face , because we 're programmed by evolution to see faces . Faces are important for us socially . And , of course , happy faces . Faces of all kinds are easy to see . ( Laughter ) You can see the happy face on Mars , there . If astronomers were frogs perhaps they 'd see Kermit the Frog . Do you see him there ? Little froggy legs . Or if geologists were elephants ? Religious iconography . ( Laughter ) Discovered by a Tennessee baker in 1996 . He charged five bucks a head to come see the nun bun till he got a cease-and-desist from Mother Teresa's lawyer . Here 's Our Lady of Guadalupe and Our Lady of Watsonville , just down the street . Or is it up the street from here ? Tree bark is particularly good because it 's nice and grainy , branchy , black-and-white splotchy and you can get the pattern-seeking -- humans are pattern-seeking animals . Here 's the Virgin Mary on the side of a glass window in Sao Paulo . Now , here 's the Virgin Mary made her appearance on a cheese sandwich -- which I got to actually hold in a Las Vegas casino , of course , this being America . ( Laughter ) This casino paid 28,500 dollars on eBay for the cheese sandwich . ( Laughter ) But who does it really look like , the Virgin Mary ? ( Laughter ) It has that sort of puckered lips , 1940s-era look . Virgin Mary in Clearwater , Florida . I actually went to see this one . There was a lot of people there -- the faithful come to be in their -- wheelchairs and crutches , and so on . And we went down , investigated . Just to give you a size -- that 's Dawkins , me and The Amazing Randi , next to this two , two and a half story size image . All these candles , so many thousands of candles people had lit in tribute to this . So we walked around the backside , just to see what was going on here , where it turns out wherever there 's a sprinkler head and a palm tree , you get the effect . Here 's the Virgin Mary on the backside , which they started to wipe off . I guess you can only have one miracle per building . ( Laughter ) So is it really a miracle of Mary , or is it a miracle of Marge ? ( Laughter ) And then I 'm going to finish up with another example of this with audio -- auditory illusions . There is this film , "" White Noise , "" with Michael Keaton about the dead talking back to us . By the way , this whole business of talking to the dead , it 's not that big a deal . Anybody can do it , turns out . It 's getting the dead to talk back that 's the really hard part . ( Laughter ) In this case , supposedly , these messages are hidden in electronic phenomena . There 's a ReverseSpeech . com web page on which I downloaded this stuff . Here is the forward -- this is the most famous one of all of these . Here 's the forward version of the very famous song . Boy , coudl n ' t you just listen to that all day ? ( Laughter ) All right , here it is backwards , and see if you can hear the hidden messages that are supposedly in there . What did you get ? ( Audience : Satan . ) Michael Shermer : Satan ? OK , well , at least we got Satan . Now , I 'll prime your auditory part of your brain to tell you what you 're supposed to hear , and then hear it again . ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) You ca n ' t miss it when I tell you what 's there . ( Laughter ) All right , I 'm going to just end with a positive , nice , little story about -- the Skeptics is a nonprofit educational organization . We 're always looking for little , good things that people do . And in England , there 's a pop singer . Very -- one of the top popular singers in England today , Katie Melua . And she wrote a beautiful song . It was in the top five in 2005 , called , "" Nine Million Bicycles in Beijing . "" It 's a love story -- she 's sort of the Norah Jones of the U. K. -- about how she much loves her guy , and compared to nine million bicycles , and so forth . And she has this one passage here . ♫ We are 12 billion light-years from the edge ♫ ♫ That 's a guess ♫ ♫ No one can ever say it 's true ♫ ♫ But I know that I will always be with you ♫ Well , that 's nice . At least she got it close . In America it would be , "" We 're 6,000 light years from the edge . "" ( Laughter ) But my friend , Simon Singh , the particle physicist , now turned science educator , and he wrote the book "" The Big Bang , "" and so on . He uses every chance he gets to promote good science . And so , he wrote an op-ed piece in The Guardian about Katie's song , in which he said , well , we know exactly how old , how far from the edge . You know , it 's 12 -- it 's 13.7 billion light years , and it 's not a guess . We know within precise error bars there how close it is . And so , we can say , although not absolutely true , that it 's pretty close to being true . And , to his credit , Katie called him up after this op-ed piece came out . And said , "" I 'm so embarrassed . I was a member of the astronomy club , and I should have known better . "" And she re-cut the song . So I 'll end with the new version . ♫ We are 13.7 billion light years ♫ ♫ from the edge of the observable universe ♫ ♫ That 's a good estimate with well-defined error bars ♫ ♫ And with the available information ♫ ♫ I predict that I will always be with you ♫ ( Applause ) How cool is that ?

478,A1,"Improbable 's Open Space Event DEVOTED AND DISGRUNTLED What are we going to do about theatre ? Facilitated by Phelim McDermott 7th and 8th January 2006 , 10am - 7pm At National Youth Theatre , 443-445 Holloway Road , London , N7 6LW I have been involved with professional theatre and performance since I left college in 1985 . Since that time I have created and co created shows which have ranged from totally improvised and devised work to classical texts for repertory theatres , from puppetry to site specific work and from dance theatre to comedy . I have performed , designed , written , devised , taught , improvised and served on the Board of the Actor's centre . Yet in all this time I have often felt an outsider in my own profession . There are things I love about theatre and things I find very difficult .. t hings which I wish were different . I find myself both devoted and disgruntled . Over the years I have often found myself gossiping and moaning about how the world I work in could be better . Not just about what we put on the stage but how we produce , manage and administrate our work . How we create it in all aspects and how we treat each other as a creative community . As a result of a NESTA fellowship I have been able to train in and research some new ways of working with groups , learning from other creative and developmental fields . On 7th and 8th of January Improbable will be hosting an Open Space Event , which I will facilitate . It hopes to support some creative ideas and actions around the issues you might feel devoted and disgruntled about . It will address the things you care about and maybe wish could be different in any aspect of our profession . The things , which you feel are important or unaddressed in our community . It will be the first time Improbable has hosted an event like this and I invite you to join us in this new adventure of trying to make change happen , or even if you are just curious about a new way of working with groups in a self organising way . I would like to stress that this event will not just be a discussion or a talking shop . We are aiming to take action and to make a difference . If you care see you there . Phelim Phelim McDermott , Co-Artistic Director , Improbable Although Open Space may be new to you it has been used all over the world with predictable results . It will be an exciting open-ended event that enables a self-organising group to use its collective imagination to deal with complex issues and it will achieve this in an incredibly short space of time . By the end of the event the following will have occurred : - Every issue of concern to anybody will have been raised , if they took responsibility for doing that . - All issues will have received full discussion , to the extent desired . - A full report of issues and discussions will be in the hands of all participants . - And YOU will have taken part in making it happen . A strong point of Open Space is it 's ability to unite groups of enormous diversity , to that end we are encouraging all participants . HOW TO REGISTER : TICKETS : £ 15 / person . All proceeds are to cover direct costs of this event including the hire of the space , refreshments and equipment hires .

1141,A17,"Few tech companies are as reliable as Roku . Every year , like clockwork , it releases a new round of streaming video boxes , each a bit faster and better than what came before . There 's the occasional welcome surprise , like the $ 50 Roku Stick that debuted earlier this year , but for the most part the company's strategy has focused on incremental improvements , not dramatic ones . Roku's latest batch of players mostly fit that mold , but they 're notable for two things : reaching a low $ 30 price point with the Express , and delivering a $ 100 player that supports 4K and HDR . That would be enough for a killer lineup , but there 's also a flagship model with more bells and whistles : the $ 130 Ultra . After spending time with both the cheapest and priciest new Roku players , I was surprised to find myself more intrigued by the possibilities of a $ 30 player than a high-end powerhouse . Gallery : Roku Express and Ultra | 7 Photos Engadget Score Poor Uninspiring Good Excellent Key Pros It 's only $ 30 ! 1080p content looks great Small and easy to set up Cons A bit slow IR remote can be inconvenient Interface is dated Summary The Roku Express is a streaming marvel thanks to its low price . If you can live with some speed issues , it 's perfect for bringing streaming video to screens all over your house . Engadget Score Poor Uninspiring Good Excellent Key Pros Incredibly fast 4K / HDR content looks fantastic Speedy networking Cons Not much more capable than Roku's $ 100 player Roku's interface is dated Summary The Roku Ultra is the company's fastest streaming player yet , and it throws in just about every feature you can imagine . The only major downside is that Roku's $ 100 Premiere + includes most of the capabilities you 'd actually need . Hardware Let's start with the Roku Express , which looks nothing like any of the company's other players . It 's as if someone took one of Roku's typical designs , shrunk it down and then chopped it in half . It 's pretty small , resembling a stack of USB sticks stuck together . Notably , though , it 's not nearly as small as the more expensive Roku Stick . If I had to use one word to describe the Express , it would be "" functional . "" It 's not attractive or much of a centerpiece device ; instead it 's something you 'd just stick in front of your TV and forget about . Its singular purpose is to get you 1080p HD streams at the lowest price possible . The Express has an HDMI socket on the back and is powered through a micro-USB port . And yes , it can easily be powered by the typical USB connections you 'd find on a TV , if you want to avoid connecting it to an AC adapter . If you 're looking for old-school RCA video connections , which were typically the main selling point of Roku's low-end gear , you 'll have to consider the $ 40 Express + . It 's pretty much the same as the Express performance-wise , except it adds those older connections . The Roku Ultra , on the other hand , looks like a covert military weapon next to the toy-like Express . It 's basically a dead ringer for the Roku 4 -- and most of the company 's relatively recent players , for that matter . On top of the usual HDMI connector , it also features an SD card slot and an Ethernet jack . Notably , it 's also the only Roku device this year to include an optical audio port ( which is useful if you 're stuck with a soundbar that does n't take HDMI audio ) and a USB port for local storage . And if you 're particularly adept at losing your remote , you can also hit the button on top of the Ultra to locate it . If the name was n't enough of a hint , the Roku Ultra is basically made for true power users . It supports 4K and HDR , but strangely enough , it 's not the only player this year to do so . The $ 100 Roku Premiere + also offers both of those features , making it a potentially better choice if you have no need for USB and optical audio . As usual , Roku is n't giving us much information about the components powering its devices . The company claims the Express is faster than the $ 50 Roku 1 it 's replacing , and that the Ultra uses a "" fast "" quad-core processor ( but so do the cheaper Premiere and Premiere + ) . And you can forget about any other technical details , like RAM or onboard storage . Ultimately , what you need to know is that both the Express and the Ultra offer a performance boost over what came before . When it comes to remotes , the Express features Roku's most basic offering yet . It has the company's typical button layout – a four-way directional pad , playback controls and shortcuts for Netflix , Hulu , Sling TV and Google Play . It also relies on infrared to communicate with the Express , so you 'll have to point it at the box whenever you want to control it . The Ultra , on the other hand , includes the company's full-featured wireless remote with voice search . Its layout is mostly the same , except it has a shortcut to Showtime ( really ? ) instead of Google Play , and it includes two extra buttons for games . And of course , the Ultra 's remote also has a headphone jack , something that Roku diehards are particularly fond of . Software If you 've seen any of Roku's previous players , there are n't many surprises with its latest OS . It sports the same black and purple aesthetic , with a heavy focus on lists for the main menu . The company's big innovations last year were the addition of voice search and the ability to follow actors and movie titles . Unfortunately , there are n't any major software upgrades for these players yet . I have the feeling I 'm beginning to sound like a broken record for criticizing Roku's archaic interface design -- just go back and look at my reviews of the Stick and Roku 4 . But , quite honestly , it 's still worth pointing out . Apple , Amazon and even TV manufacturers like Samsung and LG have made tremendous strides with their streaming interface designs over the past few years . I can understand if Roku does n't want to rock the boat too much for its fans , but a little effort would be nice . The company's mobile app , for example , got a spiffy redesign last year that makes it much easier to use . So what 's the holdup for Roku's core OS ? At the very least , you probably wo n't be staring at Roku's dull UI for too long . App developers like Netflix and Hulu can make attractive software for Roku's platform . And while they do n't reach the level of what we 're seeing on the Apple TV , they 're still more visually arresting than Roku's menus . In use Getting started with both players is relatively simple . Just plug them into a power source , hook up an HDMI cable and you 're good to go . After choosing a WiFi network , you just have to sit back and wait for the players to download apps ( since I 've been testing these players for a while , they automatically downloaded around 50 apps during setup ) . Not surprisingly , the Roku Express took a bit longer to get going , since it 's restricted to slower 2 . 4GHz WiFi networks . The Ultra , thanks to its speedier processor and support for 802 . 11ac / 5GHz networks , was able to go through the initial setup process around two to three times as fast . The most surprising thing about the Roku Express : It 's perfectly fine for basic HD streaming . Sure , moving around menus is n't lightning fast , and it takes a few seconds more than the Ultra to start streaming an HD title on Netflix and Hulu , but heck , it 's a $ 30 gadget . The fact that it works as well as it does feels impressive . The Express is ideal for throwing on additional TVs in your home , or for gifting to relatives who have n't yet gotten aboard the streaming bandwagon . The only major issue is dealing with its IR remote , which makes typing in search requests , usernames and passwords a bit cumbersome , since you always have to point at the box . It 's worth noting , though , that the Roku Express is significantly slower than the Roku Stick . The latter is smaller and sports a faster quad-core processor , and it does n't exhibit any hiccups when it comes to moving about menus or streaming media . The Stick's performance is so good that I said in my review that it made 1080p set-top boxes obsolete . But of course , at that point I did n't consider the possibility that Roku would be able to drive the price of its boxes down to $ 30 . If you 're looking for the fastest Roku experience today , then the Ultra is for you . Doing just about anything on the player is lightning fast , be it navigating complex apps or jumping into HD streams on Netflix and Roku . The only area you might notice some slowdown is with 4K / HDR streams , which are more dependent on the speed of your internet connection than the box itself . On my 802 . 11ac WiFI network , the Ultra took two to three seconds to launch 4K titles on Netflix , Amazon and Vudu . It sometimes took a few more seconds for it to bump up from a low-resolution image to something high-res . While 4K is a decent upgrade if you own a very large TV , it 's the addition of HDR that will really change how you watch things . That technology allows for a wider color range , deeper blacks and higher contrast than what we 're used to . If you have a television that supports HDR , you 'll quickly notice a bit more depth in shows like Jessica Jones and Chef's Table on Netflix . In Daredevil , HDR allowed me to see much more detail in the dark fight scenes , and in Amazon's Mozart in the Jungle it breathed new life into the show's NYC setting . Unfortunately , Roku only supports the HDR 10 standard at the moment , not the competing Dolby Vision standard . But while there are some functional differences between the two formats , Amazon , Netflix and Vudu are currently supporting both , so you wo n't miss out on much . To make it easier to find high-resolution content , Roku unveiled a special 4K section in its channel store last year . Now that same area highlights apps that feature HDR content as well . Just be ready to sign up for subscriptions or rent films to bask in the glory of HDR . The competition Here 's where things get interesting . At the low end , the Roku Express is a solid choice if you 're looking for the cheapest possible streaming solution . But if you need analog connections , you 'll have to spring for the $ 40 Express + . And if you 're worried about performance issues , it 's probably worth shelling out a bit more for the $ 50 Roku Stick . That device is significantly faster and more portable , so you can easily bring it with you around the house , or to hotels as you travel . Amazon's $ 40 Fire TV stick is another good option , though it does n't have as many apps as Roku , and the $ 90 Fire TV does n't yet support HDR . If you do n't need the optical audio and USB ports on the Ultra , you 'd be better off with the $ 100 Roku Premiere + . That player has 4K and HDR capabilities , and from what I 've seen it 's just as fast as the Ultra otherwise . The Premiere + is also a sign that there might not be much of a market left for high-end set-top boxes , especially now that the hardware to play back 4K / HDR content is getting cheaper . And what of the $ 149 Apple TV ? Last year , Apple's player was a decent competitor to the Roku 4 , even though it was stuck with 1080p content . This year , with a multitude of 4K / HDR players on the market , the Apple TV just wo n't fly anymore . Apple might soon unveil a newer player with 4K support , but until then , you 're better off avoiding the current model . Wrap-up If there 's one thing we can take away from Roku's lineup this year , it 's that you do n't have to spend much to get a good streaming player . The $ 30 Express completely redefines what a set-top box can be , and it 's hard to imagine how Roku can drive down costs even more . And while the Ultra is a fantastic device , most people would be better off spending less for the $ 100 Premiere + . All of this is good news for consumers , though it might be worrying for Roku , whose business mostly relies on selling these video players . Devindra has been obsessed with technology for as long as he can remember -- starting with the first time he ever glimpsed an NES . He spent several years fixing other people's computers before he started down the treacherous path of writing about technology . Mission accomplished ? </doc>

369,A7,"This site will tell you how to remove the oil pump mechanism . I am very receptive to comments and suggestions but you use this information at your own risk . Skill Levels explained . Skill Level with engine out : 1 . with engine in frame : 2 . Personally dirty : 2 . Work mess : 1 . Tools : 1 . Space : 1 . You do n't need to remove the engine from the frame . In most of these pictures , Valiant's engine is removed , but it was out anyway , for other work to be done . All nut and bolt sizes are given as the spanner size required to fit them . Warm the engine and then drain the oil . It is not absolutely essential to remove the radiator , as you can get by with just lifting it out of the way after unbolting it , but really it 's better to remove it . The front casing is much easier to remove if the radiator and fan are not in place . Disconnect the clutch cable at the clutch end . This is secured by two 10mm nuts ; slacken them full off , use a pair of pliers to raise the clutch arm , and slide out the nipple ( at the end of the cable ) from the clutch arm . Remove the 8mm head bolts which attach the front crankcase , and gently pry off the front cover . Do n't use force , and especially do n't use a screwdriver between the mating faces . In the photo ( right ) the clutch cover has been taken off as well , but you need n ' t do this . The bendy black tube is one of the oil feeds . Carefully remove all traces of the old gasket . Inside the open engine ( left ) . The oil pump itself is hidden behind the large shiny sprocket . This is driven by a chain directly from the crankshaft . Close-up of the crankshaft end , the oil pump drive chain , its sprocket and you can just see the oil pump behind the sprocket . The large outer pinion on the crankshaft is what drives the clutch outer basket . This drives the inner basket and that connects to the gearbox . Remove the bolt which holds on the sprocket , and pull it off with the chain ( left ) . Unbolt the oil pump from the opened crankcase , and pull it off complete with its lower pipe and the metal strainer . Frightening is n't it , what was caught on the strainer ? Having upturned ( left ) the strainer , this is what I found . Tiny bits of metal , plus some slivers of gasket and sealing compound . If you are not replacing the pump , wash off all these bits in paraffin or petrol . The oil pump chain is a continuous one and does not have a split link . If it shows sign of wear , or on reassembly it can not be correctly tensioned , you should replace it . The CX500 oil pumps are extremely simple in operation and correspondngly reliable ; they often go to 100,000 miles without replacement . They are what 's called trochoidal , which means that they work rather like a heart . An inner star-shaped steel rotor , with four arms , rotates inside an outer rotor with five corresponding cutouts . Oil is pumped between the chambers as the assembly rotates , and goes out into the oil passageways inside the engine . I 'd recommend changing the chain at 40,000 miles but the pump will be good for more than this . If you want to dismantle the pump itself , do so under surgically clean conditions . You can check the internal tolerances if you want to , but you 'll probably need an impact driver to get the holding screws out . If you dismantle the pump , there should not be more than 39 / 1000ths clearance between the inner and outer rotors , and no more than 138 / 1000ths between the outer rotor and the body of the pump . On reassembly , note that the punch mark on the outer rotor faces outwards , you should be able to see it during reassembly . Before reassembly , wash or wipe out the oil sump at the bottom of the crankcase area ( left ) . You can see the dipstick poking through in the picture . Any sludge or muck shows neglect in changing the oil and filter . A well maintained engine should be free of all deposits . Reassembly is a simple process . Do n't forget to renew the O-rings around the oil transfer passages . Ensure the 2 hollow dowels are in place ; the one at the top ( right ) and the one between the oil pump body and the front casing . Do n't omit the oil jet and O-ring adjacent to the clutch ( right ) . Finally remember to replace the O-ring directly beneath the oil pump . This feeds into the curly pipe built into the front crankcase cover . To correctly tension the chain , replace the oil pump on its mountings and insert the holding bolts not quite finger tight . Loop the chain over the crankshaft pinion and over the oil pump sprocket and locate the sprocket on the pump . It sits in a shaped slot on the oil pump's spindle . Insert the sprocket's locking bolt and tighten it to 6-9 ft lbs. Now wiggle the pump on its mounting bolts so that there is no slack in the chain and tighten the bolts to 6 ft lbs. Check the chain again afterwards . When replacing the front cover , I recommend using a gasket sealant like Hylomar , spread thinly onto both faces , with the actual gasket in between . Insert the 8mm head bolts and tighten finger tight , then in a diagonal sequence to not more than 6 ft lbs - they are easily stripped . Wipe off any excess sealant . Tachometer ( rev counter ) drive CXs sometimes develop an oil smear from the behind the radiator . This weep comes from a failed oil seal on the tachometer casing . It is easily replaced without removing the front cover , but you do need to remove the radiator and fan . You 'll need a new oil seal and tacho casing gasket . The tacho drive assembly is bolted over the front end of the camshaft , directly behind the radiator and directly above the crankshaft . It 's held on with four bolts , and then the assembly can be gently prised off ( left ) . Carefully remove all traces of the old gasket . The leaking seal is the one which fits inside the tacho drive casing , over the end of the camshaft . Poke out the old seal and insert the new one , it goes with its closed end facing outwards , towards the fan . Before refitting the casing , smear a glob of grease over the camshaft's end . Then fit the new casing gasket , again with a sealant like Hylomar . Tighten the four holding bolts back to 6-9 ft lbs. I recommend changing the oil and filter after 500 miles . </doc>

813,A16,"Hormonal Treatments / Hormone Therapy Hormones are chemicals in our bodies that send messages to cells to tell them what to do and how to work . Some cancers use hormones to help them grow . Therefore it can sound strange that we can use hormones to treat cancer as well . The clever thing is that if a person has a cancer that feeds on one type of hormone , then we can give them another type of hormone that works the opposite way .

Bruno Bauer replies to them : No one in Germany is politically emancipated . We ourselves are not free . How are we to free you ? You Jews are egoists if you demand a special emancipation for yourselves as Jews . As Germans , you ought to work for the political emancipation of Germany , and as human beings , for the emancipation of mankind , and you should feel the particular kind of your oppression and your shame not as an exception to the rule , but on the contrary as a confirmation of the rule . Or do the Jews demand the same status as Christian subjects of the state ? In that case , they recognize that the Christian state is justified and they recognize , too , the regime of general oppression . Why should they disapprove of their special yoke if they approve of the general yoke ? Why should the German be interested in the liberation of the Jew , if the Jew is not interested in the liberation of the German ? The Christian state knows only privileges . In this state , the Jew has the privilege of being a Jew . As a Jew , he has rights which the Christians do not have . Why should he want rights which he does not have , but which the Christians enjoy ? In wanting to be emancipated from the Christian state , the Jew is demanding that the Christian state should give up its religious prejudice . Does he , the Jew , give up his religious prejudice ? Has he , then , the right to demand that someone else should renounce his religion ? By its very nature , the Christian state is incapable of emancipating the Jew ; but , adds Bauer , by his very nature the Jew can not be emancipated . So long as the state is Christian and the Jew is Jewish , the one is as incapable of granting emancipation as the other is of receiving it . The Christian state can behave towards the Jew only in the way characteristic of the Christian state – that is , by granting privileges , by permitting the separation of the Jew from the other subjects , but making him feel the pressure of all the other separate spheres of society , and feel it all the more intensely because he is in religious opposition to the dominant religion . But the Jew , too , can behave towards the state only in a Jewish way – that is , by treating it as something alien to him , by counterposing his imaginary nationality to the real nationality , by counterposing his illusory law to the real law , by deeming himself justified in separating himself from mankind , by abstaining on principle from taking part in the historical movement , by putting his trust in a future which has nothing in common with the future of mankind in general , and by seeing himself as a member of the Jewish people , and the Jewish people as the chosen people . On what grounds , then , do you Jews want emancipation ? On account of your religion ? It is the mortal enemy of the state religion . As citizens ? In Germany , there are no citizens . As human beings ? But you are no more human beings than those to whom you appeal . Bauer has posed the question of Jewish emancipation in a new form , after giving a critical analysis of the previous formulations and solutions of the question . What , he asks , is the nature of the Jew who is to be emancipated and of the Christian state that is to emancipate him ? He replies by a critique of the Jewish religion , he analyzes the religious opposition between Judaism and Christianity , he elucidates the essence of the Christian state – and he does all this audaciously , trenchantly , wittily , and with profundity , in a style of writing that is as precise as it is pithy and vigorous . How , then , does Bauer solve the Jewish question ? What is the result ? The formulation of a question is its solution . The critique of the Jewish question is the answer to the Jewish question . The summary , therefore , is as follows : We must emancipate ourselves before we can emancipate others . The most rigid form of the opposition between the Jew and the Christian is the religious opposition . How is an opposition resolved ? By making it impossible . How is religious opposition made impossible ? By abolishing religion . As soon as Jew and Christian recognize that their respective religions are no more than different stages in the development of the human mind , different snake skins cast off by history , and that man is the snake who sloughed them , the relation of Jew and Christian is no longer religious but is only a critical , scientific , and human relation . Science , then , constitutes their unity . But , contradictions in science are resolved by science itself . The German Jew , in particular , is confronted by the general absence of political emancipation and the strongly marked Christian character of the state . In Bauer's conception , however , the Jewish question has a universal significance , independent of specifically German conditions . It is the question of the relation of religion to the state , of the contradiction between religious constraint and political emancipation . Emancipation from religion is laid down as a condition , both to the Jew who wants to be emancipated politically , and to the state which is to effect emancipation and is itself to be emancipated . "" Very well , "" it is said , and the Jew himself says it , "" the Jew is to become emancipated not as a Jew , not because he is a Jew , not because he possesses such an excellent , universally human principle of morality ; on the contrary , the Jew will retreat behind the citizen and be a citizen , although he is a Jew and is to remain a Jew . That is to say , he is and remains a Jew , although he is a citizen and lives in universally human conditions : his Jewish and restricted nature triumphs always in the end over his human and political obligations . The prejudice remains in spite of being outstripped by general principles . But if it remains , then , on the contrary , it outstrips everything else . "" "" Only sophistically , only apparently , would the Jew be able to remain a Jew in the life of the state . Hence , if he wanted to remain a Jew , the mere appearance would become the essential and would triumph ; that is to say , his life in the state would be only a semblance or only a temporary exception to the essential and the rule . "" ( "" The Capacity of Present-Day Jews and Christians to Become Free , "" Einundzwanzig Bogen , pp. 57 ) Let us hear , on the other hand , how Bauer presents the task of the state . "" France , "" he says , "" has recently shown us "" ( Proceedings of the Chamber of Deputies , December 26 , 1840 ) "" in the connection with the Jewish question – just as it has continually done in all other political questions – the spectacle of a life which is free , but which revokes its freedom by law , hence declaring it to be an appearance , and on the other hand contradicting its free laws by its action . "" ( The Jewish Question , p. 64 ) "" In France , universal freedom is not yet the law , the Jewish question too has not yet been solved , because legal freedom – the fact that all citizens are equal – is restricted in actual life , which is still dominated and divided by religious privileges , and this lack of freedom in actual life reacts on law and compels the latter to sanction the division of the citizens , who as such are free , into oppressed and oppressors . "" ( p. 65 ) When , therefore , would the Jewish question be solved for France ? "" The Jew , for example , would have ceased to be a Jew if he did not allow himself to be prevented by his laws from fulfilling his duty to the state and his fellow citizens , that is , for example , if on the Sabbath he attended the Chamber of Deputies and took part in the official proceedings . Every religious privilege , and therefore also the monopoly of a privileged church , would have been abolished altogether , and if some or many persons , or even the overwhelming majority , still believed themselves bound to fulfil religious duties , this fulfilment ought to be left to them as a purely private matter . "" ( p. 65 ) "" There is no longer any religion when there is no longer any privileged religion . Take from religion its exclusive power and it will no longer exist . "" ( p. 66 ) "" Just as M. Martin du Nord saw the proposal to omit mention of Sunday in the law as a motion to declare that Christianity has ceased to exist , with equal reason ( and this reason is very well founded ) the declaration that the law of the Sabbath is no longer binding on the Jew would be a proclamation abolishing Judaism . "" ( p. 71 ) Bauer , therefore , demands , on the one hand , that the Jew should renounce Judaism , and that mankind in general should renounce religion , in order to achieve civic emancipation . On the other hand , he quite consistently regards the political abolition of religion as the abolition of religion as such . The state which presupposes religion is not yet a true , real state . "" Of course , the religious notion affords security to the state . But to what state ? To what kind of state ? "" ( p. 97 ) At this point , the one-sided formulation of the Jewish question becomes evident . It was by no means sufficient to investigate : Who is to emancipate ? Who is to be emancipated ? Criticism had to investigate a third point . It had to inquire : What kind of emancipation is in question ? What conditions follow from the very nature of the emancipation that is demanded ? Only the criticism of political emancipation itself would have been the conclusive criticism of the Jewish question and its real merging in the "" general question of time . "" Because Bauer does not raise the question to this level , he becomes entangled in contradictions . He puts forward conditions which are not based on the nature of political emancipation itself . He raises questions which are not part of his problem , and he solves problems which leave this question unanswered . When Bauer says of the opponents of Jewish emancipation : "" Their error was only that they assumed the Christian state to be the only true one and did not subject it to the same criticism that they applied to Judaism "" ( op . cit. , p. 3 ) , we find that his error lies in the fact that he subjects to criticism only the "" Christian state , "" not the "" state as such , "" that he does not investigate the relation of political emancipation to human emancipation and , therefore , puts forward conditions which can be explained only by uncritical confusion of political emancipation with general human emancipation . If Bauer asks the Jews : Have you , from your standpoint , the right to want political emancipation ? We ask the converse question : Does the standpoint of political emancipation give the right to demand from the Jew the abolition of Judaism and from man the abolition of religion ? The Jewish question acquires a different form depending on the state in which the Jew lives . In Germany , where there is no political state , no state as such , the Jewish question is a purely theological one . The Jew finds himself in religious opposition to the state , which recognizes Christianity as its basis . This state is a theologian ex professo . Criticism here is criticism of theology , a double-edged criticism – criticism of Christian theology and of Jewish theology . Hence , we continue to operate in the sphere of theology , however much we may operate critically within it . In France , a constitutional state , the Jewish question is a question of constitutionalism , the question of the incompleteness of political emancipation . Since the semblance of a state religion is retained here , although in a meaningless and self-contradictory formula , that of a religion of the majority , the relation of the Jew to the state retains the semblance of a religious , theological opposition . Only in the North American states – at least , in some of them – does the Jewish question lose its theological significance and become a really secular question . Only where the political state exists in its completely developed form can the relation of the Jew , and of the religious man in general , to the political state , and therefore the relation of religion to the state , show itself in its specific character , in its purity . The criticism of this relation ceases to be theological criticism as soon as the state ceases to adopt a theological attitude toward religion , as soon as it behaves towards religion as a state – i . e . , politically . Criticism , then , becomes criticism of the political state . At this point , where the question ceases to be theological , Bauer's criticism ceases to be critical . "" In the United States there is neither a state religion nor a religion declared to be that of the majority , nor the predominance of one cult over another . The state stands aloof from all cults . "" ( Marie ou l ' esclavage aux Etats-Unis , etc. , by G. de Beaumont , Paris , 1835 , p. 214 ) Indeed , there are some North American states where "" the constitution does not impose any religious belief or religious practice as a condition of political rights . "" ( op . cit. , p. 225 ) Nevertheless , "" in the United States people do not believe that a man without religion could be an honest man . "" ( op . cit. , p. 224 ) Nevertheless , North America is pre-eminently the country of religiosity , as Beaumont , Tocqueville , and the Englishman Hamilton unanimously assure us . The North American states , however , serve us only as an example . The question is : What is the relation of complete political emancipation to religion ? If we find that even in the country of complete political emancipation , religion not only exists , but displays a fresh and vigorous vitality , that is proof that the existence of religion is not in contradiction to the perfection of the state . Since , however , the existence of religion is the existence of defect , the source of this defect can only be sought in the nature of the state itself . We no longer regard religion as the cause , but only as the manifestation of secular narrowness . Therefore , we explain the religious limitations of the free citizen by their secular limitations . We do not assert that they must overcome their religious narrowness in order to get rid of their secular restrictions , we assert that they will overcome their religious narrowness once they get rid of their secular restrictions . We do not turn secular questions into theological ones . History has long enough been merged in superstition , we now merge superstition in history . The question of the relation of political emancipation to religion becomes for us the question of the relation of political emancipation to human emancipation . We criticize the religious weakness of the political state by criticizing the political state in its secular form , apart from its weaknesses as regards religion . The contradiction between the state and a particular religion , for instance Judaism , is given by us a human form as the contradiction between the state and particular secular elements ; the contradiction between the state and religion in general as the contradiction between the state and its presuppositions in general . The political emancipation of the Jew , the Christian , and , in general , of religious man , is the emancipation of the state from Judaism , from Christianity , from religion in general . In its own form , in the manner characteristic of its nature , the state as a state emancipates itself from religion by emancipating itself from the state religion – that is to say , by the state as a state not professing any religion , but , on the contrary , asserting itself as a state . The political emancipation from religion is not a religious emancipation that has been carried through to completion and is free from contradiction , because political emancipation is not a form of human emancipation which has been carried through to completion and is free from contradiction . The limits of political emancipation are evident at once from the fact that the state can free itself from a restriction without man being really free from this restriction , that the state can be a free state [ pun on word Freistaat , which also means republic ] without man being a free man . Bauer himself tacitly admits this when he lays down the following condition for political emancipation : "" Every religious privilege , and therefore also the monopoly of a privileged church , would have been abolished altogether , and if some or many persons , or even the overwhelming majority , still believed themselves bound to fulfil religious duties , this fulfilment ought to be left to them as a purely private matter . "" [ The Jewish Question , p. 65 ] It is possible , therefore , for the state to have emancipated itself from religion even if the overwhelming majority is still religious . And the overwhelming majority does not cease to be religious through being religious in private . But , the attitude of the state , and of the republic [ free state ] in particular , to religion is , after all , only the attitude to religion of the men who compose the state . It follows from this that man frees himself through the medium of the state , that he frees himself politically from a limitation when , in contradiction with himself , he raises himself above this limitation in an abstract , limited , and partial way . It follows further that , by freeing himself politically , man frees himself in a roundabout way , through an intermediary , although an essential intermediary . It follows , finally , that man , even if he proclaims himself an atheist through the medium of the state – that is , if he proclaims the state to be atheist – still remains in the grip of religion , precisely because he acknowledges himself only by a roundabout route , only through an intermediary . Religion is precisely the recognition of man in a roundabout way , through an intermediary . The state is the intermediary between man and man's freedom . Just as Christ is the intermediary to whom man transfers the burden of all his divinity , all his religious constraint , so the state is the intermediary to whom man transfers all his non-divinity and all his human unconstraint . The political elevation of man above religion shares all the defects and all the advantages of political elevation in general . The state as a state annuls , for instance , private property , man declares by political means that private property is abolished as soon as the property qualification for the right to elect or be elected is abolished , as has occurred in many states of North America . Hamilton quite correctly interprets this fact from a political point of view as meaning : "" the masses have won a victory over the property owners and financial wealth . "" [ Thomas Hamilton , Men and Manners in America , 2 vols , Edinburgh , 1833 , p. 146 ] Is not private property abolished in idea if the non-property owner has become the legislator for the property owner ? The property qualification for the suffrage is the last political form of giving recognition to private property . Nevertheless , the political annulment of private property not only fails to abolish private property but even presupposes it . The state abolishes , in its own way , distinctions of birth , social rank , education , occupation , when it declares that birth , social rank , education , occupation , are non-political distinctions , when it proclaims , without regard to these distinction , that every member of the nation is an equal participant in national sovereignty , when it treats all elements of the real life of the nation from the standpoint of the state . Nevertheless , the state allows private property , education , occupation , to act in their way – i . e . , as private property , as education , as occupation , and to exert the influence of their special nature . Far from abolishing these real distinctions , the state only exists on the presupposition of their existence ; it feels itself to be a political state and asserts its universality only in opposition to these elements of its being . Hegel , therefore , defines the relation of the political state to religion quite correctly when he says : "" In order [ ... ] that the state should come into existence as the self-knowing , moral reality of the mind , its distraction from the form of authority and faith is essential . But this distinction emerges only insofar as the ecclesiastical aspect arrives at a separation within itself . It is only in this way that the state , above the particular churches , has achieved and brought into existence universality of thought , which is the principle of its form "" ( Hegel's Philosophy of Right , 1st edition , p. 346 ) . Of course ! Only in this way , above the particular elements , does the state constitute itself as universality . The perfect political state is , by its nature , man's species-life , as opposed to his material life . All the preconditions of this egoistic life continue to exist in civil society outside the sphere of the state , but as qualities of civil society . Where the political state has attained its true development , man – not only in thought , in consciousness , but in reality , in life – leads a twofold life , a heavenly and an earthly life : life in the political community , in which he considers himself a communal being , and life in civil society , in which he acts as a private individual , regards other men as a means , degrades himself into a means , and becomes the plaything of alien powers . The relation of the political state to civil society is just as spiritual as the relations of heaven to earth . The political state stands in the same opposition to civil society , and it prevails over the latter in the same way as religion prevails over the narrowness of the secular world – i . e . , by likewise having always to acknowledge it , to restore it , and allow itself to be dominated by it . In his most immediate reality , in civil society , man is a secular being . Here , where he regards himself as a real individual , and is so regarded by others , he is a fictitious phenomenon . In the state , on the other hand , where man is regarded as a species-being , he is the imaginary member of an illusory sovereignty , is deprived of his real individual life and endowed with an unreal universality . Man , as the adherent of a particular religion , finds himself in conflict with his citizenship and with other men as members of the community . This conflict reduces itself to the secular division between the political state and civil society . For man as a bourgeois [ i . e . , as a member of civil society , "" bourgeois society "" in German ] , "" life in the state "" is "" only a semblance or a temporary exception to the essential and the rule . "" Of course , the bourgeois , like the Jew , remains only sophistically in the sphere of political life , just as the citoyen [ ' citizen ' in French , i . e . , the participant in political life ] only sophistically remains a Jew or a bourgeois . But , this sophistry is not personal . It is the sophistry of the political state itself . The difference between the merchant and the citizen [ Staatsbürger ] , between the day-laborer and the citizen , between the landowner and the citizen , between the merchant and the citizen , between the living individual and the citizen . The contradiction in which the religious man finds himself with the political man is the same contradiction in which the bourgeois finds himself with the citoyen , and the member of civil society with his political lion's skin . This secular conflict , to which the Jewish question ultimately reduces itself , the relation between the political state and its preconditions , whether these are material elements , such as private property , etc. , or spiritual elements , such as culture or religion , the conflict between the general interest and private interest , the schism between the political state and civil society – these secular antitheses Bauer allows to persist , whereas he conducts a polemic against their religious expression . "" It is precisely the basis of civil society , the need that ensures the continuance of this society and guarantees its necessity , which exposes its existence to continual dangers , maintains in it an element of uncertainty , and produces that continually changing mixture of poverty and riches , of distress and prosperity , and brings about change in general . "" ( p. 8 ) Compare the whole section : "" Civil Society "" ( pp. 8-9 ) , which has been drawn up along the basic lines of Hegel's philosophy of law . Civil society , in its opposition to the political state , is recognized as necessary , because the political state is recognized as necessary . Political emancipation is , of course , a big step forward . True , it is not the final form of human emancipation in general , but it is the final form of human emancipation within the hitherto existing world order . It goes without saying that we are speaking here of real , practical emancipation . Man emancipates himself politically from religion by banishing it from the sphere of public law to that of private law . Religion is no longer the spirit of the state , in which man behaves – although in a limited way , in a particular form , and in a particular sphere – as a species-being , in community with other men . Religion has become the spirit of civil society , of the sphere of egoism , of bellum omnium contra omnes . It is no longer the essence of community , but the essence of difference . It has become the expression of man's separation from his community , from himself and from other men – as it was originally . It is only the abstract avowal of specific perversity , private whimsy , and arbitrariness . The endless fragmentation of religion in North America , for example , gives it even externally the form of a purely individual affair . It has been thrust among the multitude of private interests and ejected from the community as such . But one should be under no illusion about the limits of political emancipation . The division of the human being into a public man and a private man , the displacement of religion from the state into civil society , this is not a stage of political emancipation but its completion ; this emancipation , therefore , neither abolished the real religiousness of man , nor strives to do so . The decomposition of man into Jew and citizen , Protestant and citizen , religious man and citizen , is neither a deception directed against citizenhood , nor is it a circumvention of political emancipation , it is political emancipation itself , the political method of emancipating oneself from religion . Of course , in periods when the political state as such is born violently out of civil society , when political liberation is the form in which men strive to achieve their liberation , the state can and must go as far as the abolition of religion , the destruction of religion . But it can do so only in the same way that it proceeds to the abolition of private property , to the maximum , to confiscation , to progressive taxation , just as it goes as far as the abolition of life , the guillotine . At times of special self-confidence , political life seeks to suppress its prerequisite , civil society and the elements composing this society , and to constitute itself as the real species-life of man , devoid of contradictions . But , it can achieve this only by coming into violent contradiction with its own conditions of life , only by declaring the revolution to be permanent , and , therefore , the political drama necessarily ends with the re-establishment of religion , private property , and all elements of civil society , just as war ends with peace . Indeed , the perfect Christian state is not the so-called Christian state – which acknowledges Christianity as its basis , as the state religion , and , therefore , adopts an exclusive attitude towards other religions . On the contrary , the perfect Christian state is the atheistic state , the democratic state , the state which relegates religion to a place among the other elements of civil society . The state which is still theological , which still officially professes Christianity as its creed , which still does not dare to proclaim itself as a state , has , in its reality as a state , not yet succeeded in expressing the human basis – of which Christianity is the high-flown expression – in a secular , human form . The so-called Christian state is simply nothing more than a non-state , since it is not Christianity as a religion , but only the human background of the Christian religion , which can find its expression in actual human creations . The so-called Christian state is the Christian negation of the state , but by no means the political realization of Christianity . The state which still professes Christianity in the form of religion , does not yet profess it in the form appropriate to the state , for it still has a religious attitude towards religion – that is to say , it is not the true implementation of the human basis of religion , because it still relies on the unreal , imaginary form of this human core . The so-called Christian state is the imperfect state , and the Christian religion is regarded by it as the supplementation and sanctification of its imperfection . For the Christian state , therefore , religion necessarily becomes a means ; hence , it is a hypocritical state . It makes a great difference whether the complete state , because of the defect inherent in the general nature of the state , counts religion among its presuppositions , or whether the incomplete state , because of the defect inherent in its particular existence as a defective state , declares that religion is its basis . In the latter case , religion becomes imperfect politics . In the former case , the imperfection even of consummate politics becomes evident in religion . The so-called Christian state needs the Christian religion in order to complete itself as a state . The democratic state , the real state , does not need religion for its political completion . On the contrary , it can disregard religion because in it the human basis of religion is realized in a secular manner . The so-called Christian state , on the other hand , has a political attitude to religion and a religious attitude to politics . By degrading the forms of the state to mere semblance , it equally degrades religion to mere semblance . In order to make this contradiction clearer , let us consider Bauer's projection of the Christian state , a projection based on his observation of the Christian-German state . "" Recently , "" says Bauer , "" in order to prove the impossibility or non-existence of a Christian state , reference has frequently been made to those sayings in the Gospel with which the [ present-day ] state not only does not comply , but can not possibly comply , if it does not want to dissolve itself completely [ as a state ] . "" "" But the matter can not be disposed of so easily . What do these Gospel sayings demand ? Supernatural renunciation of self , submission to the authority of revelation , a turning-away from the state , the abolition of secular conditions . Well , the Christian state demands and accomplishes all that . It has assimilated the spirit of the Gospel , and if it does not reproduce this spirit in the same terms as the Gospel , that occurs only because it expresses this spirit in political forms , i . e . , in forms which , it is true , are taken from the political system in this world , but which in the religious rebirth that they have to undergo become degraded to a mere semblance . This is a turning-away from the state while making use of political forms for its realization . "" ( p. 55 ) Bauer then explains that the people of a Christian state is only a non-people , no longer having a will of its own , but whose true existence lies in the leader to whom it is subjected , although this leader by his origin and nature is alien to it – i . e . , given by God and imposed on the people without any co-operation on its part . Bauer declares that the laws of such a people are not its own creation , but are actual revelations , that its supreme chief needs privileged intermediaries with the people in the strict sense , with the masses , and that the masses themselves are divided into a multitude of particular groupings which are formed and determined by chance , which are differentiated by their interests , their particular passions and prejudices , and obtain permission as a privilege , to isolate themselves from one another , etc. ( p. 56 ) However , Bauer himself says : "" Politics , if it is to be nothing but religion , ought not to be politics , just as the cleaning of saucepans , if it is to be accepted as a religious matter , ought not to be regarded as a matter of domestic economy . "" ( p. 108 ) In the Christian-German state , however , religion is an "" economic matter "" just as "" economic matters "" belong to the sphere of religion . The domination of religion in the Christian-German state is the religion of domination . The separation of the "" spirit of the Gospel "" from the "" letter of the Gospel "" is an irreligious act . A state which makes the Gospel speak in the language of politics – that is , in another language than that of the Holy Ghost – commits sacrilege , if not in human eyes , then in the eyes of its own religion . The state which acknowledges Christianity as its supreme criterion , and the Bible as its Charter , must be confronted with the words of Holy Scripture , for every word of Scripture is holy . This state , as well as the human rubbish on which it is based , is caught in a painful contradiction that is insoluble from the standpoint of religious consciousness when it is referred to those sayings of the Gospel with which it "" not only does not comply , but can not possibly comply , if it does not want to dissolve itself completely as a state . "" And why does it not want to dissolve itself completely ? The state itself can not give an answer either to itself or to others . In its own consciousness , the official Christian state is an imperative , the realization of which is unattainable , the state can assert the reality of its existence only by lying to itself , and therefore always remains in its own eyes an object of doubt , an unreliable , problematic object . Criticism is , therefore , fully justified in forcing the state that relies on the Bible into a mental derangement in which it no longer knows whether it is an illusion or a reality , and in which the infamy of its secular aims , for which religion serves as a cloak , comes into insoluble conflict with the sincerity of its religious consciousness , for which religion appears as the aim of the world . This state can only save itself from its inner torment if it becomes the police agent of the Catholic Church . In relation to the church , which declares the secular power to be its servant , the state is powerless , the secular power which claims to be the rule of the religious spirit is powerless . It is , indeed , estrangement which matters in the so-called Christian state , but not man . The only man who counts , the king , is a being specifically different from other men , and is , moreover , a religious being , directly linked with heaven , with God . The relationships which prevail here are still relationships dependent of faith . The religious spirit , therefore , is still not really secularized . But , furthermore , the religious spirit can not be really secularized , for what is it in itself but the non-secular form of a stage in the development of the human mind ? The religious spirit can only be secularized insofar as the stage of development of the human mind of which it is the religious expression makes its appearance and becomes constituted in its secular form . This takes place in the democratic state . Not Christianity , but the human basis of Christianity is the basis of this state . Religion remains the ideal , non-secular consciousness of its members , because religion is the ideal form of the stage of human development achieved in this state . The members of the political state are religious owing to the dualism between individual life and species-life , between the life of civil society and political life . They are religious because men treat the political life of the state , an area beyond their real individuality , as if it were their true life . They are religious insofar as religion here is the spirit of civil society , expressing the separation and remoteness of man from man . Political democracy is Christian since in it man , not merely one man but everyman , ranks as sovereign , as the highest being , but it is man in his uncivilized , unsocial form , man in his fortuitous existence , man just as he is , man as he has been corrupted by the whole organization of our society , who has lost himself , been alienated , and handed over to the rule of inhuman conditions and elements – in short , man who is not yet a real species-being . That which is a creation of fantasy , a dream , a postulate of Christianity , i . e . , the sovereignty of man – but man as an alien being different from the real man – becomes , in democracy , tangible reality , present existence , and secular principle . In the perfect democracy , the religious and theological consciousness itself is in its own eyes the more religious and the more theological because it is apparently without political significance , without worldly aims , the concern of a disposition that shuns the world , the expression of intellectual narrow-mindedness , the product of arbitrariness and fantasy , and because it is a life that is really of the other world . Christianity attains , here , the practical expression of its universal-religious significance in that the most diverse world outlooks are grouped alongside one another in the form of Christianity and still more because it does not require other people to profess Christianity , but only religion in general , any kind of religion ( cf. Beaumont's work quoted above ) . The religious consciousness revels in the wealth of religious contradictions and religious diversity . We have , thus , shown that political emancipation from religion leaves religion in existence , although not a privileged religion . The contradiction in which the adherent of a particular religion finds himself involved in relation to his citizenship is only one aspect of the universal secular contradiction between the political state and civil society . The consummation of the Christian state is the state which acknowledges itself as a state and disregards the religion of its members . The emancipation of the state from religion is not the emancipation of the real man from religion . Therefore , we do not say to the Jews , as Bauer does : You can not be emancipated politically without emancipating yourselves radically from Judaism . On the contrary , we tell them : Because you can be emancipated politically without renouncing Judaism completely and incontrovertibly , political emancipation itself is not human emancipation . If you Jews want to be emancipated politically , without emancipating yourselves humanly , the half-hearted approach and contradiction is not in you alone , it is inherent in the nature and category of political emancipation . If you find yourself within the confines of this category , you share in a general confinement . Just as the state evangelizes when , although it is a state , it adopts a Christian attitude towards the Jews , so the Jew acts politically when , although a Jew , he demands civic rights . But , if a man , although a Jew , can be emancipated politically and receive civic rights , can he lay claim to the so-called rights of man and receive them ? Bauer denies it . "" The question is whether the Jew as such , that is , the Jew who himself admits that he is compelled by his true nature to live permanently in separation from other men , is capable of receiving the universal rights of man and of conceding them to others . "" "" For the Christian world , the idea of the rights of man was only discovered in the last century . It is not innate in men ; on the contrary , it is gained only in a struggle against the historical traditions in which hitherto man was brought up . Thus the rights of man are not a gift of nature , not a legacy from past history , but the reward of the struggle against the accident of birth and against the privileges which up to now have been handed down by history from generation to generation . These rights are the result of culture , and only one who has earned and deserved them can possess them . "" "" Can the Jew really take possession of them ? As long as he is a Jew , the restricted nature which makes him a Jew is bound to triumph over the human nature which should link him as a man with other men , and will separate him from non-Jews . He declares by this separation that the particular nature which makes him a Jew is his true , highest nature , before which human nature has to give way . "" "" Similarly , the Christian as a Christian can not grant the rights of man . "" ( p. 19-20 ) According to Bauer , man has to sacrifice the "" privilege of faith "" to be able to receive the universal rights of man . Let us examine , for a moment , the so-called rights of man – to be precise , the rights of man in their authentic form , in the form which they have among those who discovered them , the North Americans and the French . These rights of man are , in part , political rights , rights which can only be exercised in community with others . Their content is participation in the community , and specifically in the political community , in the life of the state . They come within the category of political freedom , the category of civic rights , which , as we have seen , in no way presuppose the incontrovertible and positive abolition of religion – nor , therefore , of Judaism . There remains to be examined the other part of the rights of man – the droits d ' homme , insofar as these differ from the droits d ' citoyen . Included among them is freedom of conscience , the right to practice any religion one chooses . The privilege of faith is expressly recognized either as a right of man or as the consequence of a right of man , that of liberty . Déclaration des droits de l ' droits et du citoyen , 1791 , Article 10 : "" No one is to be subjected to annoyance because of his opinions , even religious opinions . "" "" The freedom of every man to practice the religion of which he is an adherent . "" Declaration of the Rights of Man , etc. , 1793 , includes among the rights of man , Article 7 : "" The free exercise of religion . "" Indeed , in regard to man's right to express his thoughts and opinions , to hold meetings , and to exercise his religion , it is even stated : "" The necessity of proclaiming these rights presupposes either the existence or the recent memory of despotism . "" Compare the Constitution of 1795 , Section XIV , Article 354 . Constitution of Pennsylvania , Article 9 , § 3 : "" All men have received from nature the imprescriptible right to worship the Almighty according to the dictates of their conscience , and no one can be legally compelled to follow , establish , or support against his will any religion or religious ministry . No human authority can , in any circumstances , intervene in a matter of conscience or control the forces of the soul . "" Constitution of New Hampshire , Article 5 and 6 : "" Among these natural rights some are by nature inalienable since nothing can replace them . The rights of conscience are among them . "" ( Beaumont , op . cit. , pp. 213,214 ) Incompatibility between religion and the rights of man is to such a degree absent from the concept of the rights of man that , on the contrary , a man's right to be religious , in any way he chooses , to practise his own particular religion , is expressly included among the rights of man . The privilege of faith is a universal right of man . The droits de l ' homme , the rights of man , are , as such , distinct from the droits du citoyen , the rights of the citizen . Who is homme as distinct from citoyen ? None other than the member of civil society . Why is the member of civil society called "" man , "" simply man ; why are his rights called the rights of man ? How is this fact to be explained ? From the relationship between the political state and civil society , from the nature of political emancipation . Above all , we note the fact that the so-called rights of man , the droits de l ' homme as distinct from the droits du citoyen , are nothing but the rights of a member of civil society – i . e . , the rights of egoistic man , of man separated from other men and from the community . Let us hear what the most radical Constitution , the Constitution of 1793 , has to say : Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen . Article 2 . "" These rights , etc. , ( the natural and imprescriptible rights ) are : equality , liberty , security , property . "" What constitutes liberty ? Article 6 . "" Liberty is the power which man has to do everything that does not harm the rights of others , "" or , according to the Declaration of the Rights of Man of 1791 : "" Liberty consists in being able to do everything which does not harm others . "" Liberty , therefore , is the right to do everything that harms no one else . The limits within which anyone can act without harming someone else are defined by law , just as the boundary between two fields is determined by a boundary post . It is a question of the liberty of man as an isolated monad , withdrawn into himself . Why is the Jew , according to Bauer , incapable of acquiring the rights of man ? "" As long as he is a Jew , the restricted nature which makes him a Jew is bound to triumph over the human nature which should link him as a man with other men , and will separate him from non-Jews . "" But , the right of man to liberty is based not on the association of man with man , but on the separation of man from man . It is the right of this separation , the right of the restricted individual , withdrawn into himself . The practical application of man's right to liberty is man's right to private property . What constitutes man's right to private property ? Article 16 . ( Constitution of 1793 ) : "" The right of property is that which every citizen has of enjoying and of disposing at his discretion of his goods and income , of the fruits of his labor and industry . "" The right of man to private property is , therefore , the right to enjoy one's property and to dispose of it at one's discretion ( à son gré ) , without regard to other men , independently of society , the right of self-interest . This individual liberty and its application form the basis of civil society . It makes every man see in other men not the realization of his own freedom , but the barrier to it . But , above all , it proclaims the right of man "" of enjoying and of disposing at his discretion of his goods and income , of the fruits of his labor and industry . "" There remain the other rights of man : égalité and sûreté . Equality , used here in its non-political sense , is nothing but the equality of the liberté described above – namely : each man is to the same extent regarded as such a self-sufficient monad . The Constitution of 1795 defines the concept of this equality , in accordance with this significance , as follows : Article 3 ( Constitution of 1795 ) : "" Equality consists in the law being the same for all , whether it protects or punishes . "" And security ? Article 8 ( Constitution of 1793 ) : "" Security consists in the protection afforded by society to each of its members for the preservation of his person , his rights , and his property . "" Security is the highest social concept of civil society , the concept of police , expressing the fact that the whole of society exists only in order to guarantee to each of its members the preservation of his person , his rights , and his property . It is in this sense that Hegel calls civil society "" the state of need and reason . "" The concept of security does not raise civil society above its egoism . On the contrary , security is the insurance of egoism . None of the so-called rights of man , therefore , go beyond egoistic man , beyond man as a member of civil society – that is , an individual withdrawn into himself , into the confines of his private interests and private caprice , and separated from the community . In the rights of man , he is far from being conceived as a species-being ; on the contrary , species-like itself , society , appears as a framework external to the individuals , as a restriction of their original independence . The sole bond holding them together is natural necessity , need and private interest , the preservation of their property and their egoistic selves . It is puzzling enough that a people which is just beginning to liberate itself , to tear down all the barriers between its various sections , and to establish a political community , that such a people solemnly proclaims ( Declaration of 1791 ) the rights of egoistic man separated from his fellow men and from the community , and that indeed it repeats this proclamation at a moment when only the most heroic devotion can save the nation , and is therefore imperatively called for , at a moment when the sacrifice of all the interest of civil society must be the order of the day , and egoism must be punished as a crime . ( Declaration of the Rights of Man , etc. , of 1793 ) This fact becomes still more puzzling when we see that the political emancipators go so far as to reduce citizenship , and the political community , to a mere means for maintaining these so-called rights of man , that , therefore , the citoyen is declared to be the servant of egotistic homme , that the sphere in which man acts as a communal being is degraded to a level below the sphere in which he acts as a partial being , and that , finally , it is not man as citoyen , but man as private individual [ bourgeois ] who is considered to be the essential and true man . "" The aim of all political association is the preservation of the natural and imprescriptible rights of man . "" ( Declaration of the Rights , etc. , of 1791 , Article 2 ) "" Government is instituted in order to guarantee man the enjoyment of his natural and imprescriptible rights . "" ( Declaration , etc. , of 1793 , Article 1 ) Hence , even in moments when its enthusiasm still has the freshness of youth and is intensified to an extreme degree by the force of circumstances , political life declares itself to be a mere means , whose purpose is the life of civil society . It is true that its revolutionary practice is in flagrant contradiction with its theory . Whereas , for example , security is declared one of the rights of man , violation of the privacy of correspondence is openly declared to be the order of the day . Whereas "" unlimited freedom of the press "" ( Constitution of 1793 , Article 122 ) is guaranteed as a consequence of the right of man to individual liberty , freedom of the press is totally destroyed , because "" freedom of the press should not be permitted when it endangers public liberty . "" ( "" Robespierre jeune , "" Historie parlementaire de la Révolution française by Buchez and Roux , vol. 28 , p. 159 ) That is to say , therefore : The right of man to liberty ceases to be a right as soon as it comes into conflict with political life , whereas in theory political life is only the guarantee of human rights , the rights of the individual , and therefore must be abandoned as soon as it comes into contradiction with its aim , with these rights of man . But , practice is merely the exception , theory is the rule . But even if one were to regard revolutionary practice as the correct presentation of the relationship , there would still remain the puzzle of why the relationship is turned upside-down in the minds of the political emancipators and the aim appears as the means , while the means appears as the aim . This optical illusion of their consciousness would still remain a puzzle , although now a psychological , a theoretical puzzle . The puzzle is easily solved . Political emancipation is , at the same time , the dissolution of the old society on which the state alienated from the people , the sovereign power , is based . What was the character of the old society ? It can be described in one word – feudalism . The character of the old civil society was directly political – that is to say , the elements of civil life , for example , property , or the family , or the mode of labor , were raised to the level of elements of political life in the form of seigniory , estates , and corporations . In this form , they determined the relation of the individual to the state as a whole – i . e . , his political relation , that is , his relation of separation and exclusion from the other components of society . For that organization of national life did not raise property or labor to the level of social elements ; on the contrary , it completed their separation from the state as a whole and constituted them as discrete societies within society . Thus , the vital functions and conditions of life of civil society remained , nevertheless , political , although political in the feudal sense – that is to say , they secluded the individual from the state as a whole and they converted the particular relation of his corporation to the state as a whole into his general relation to the life of the nation , just as they converted his particular civil activity and situation into his general activity and situation . As a result of this organization , the unity of the state , and also the consciousness , will , and activity of this unity , the general power of the state , are likewise bound to appear as the particular affair of a ruler and of his servants , isolated from the people . The political revolution which overthrew this sovereign power and raised state affairs to become affairs of the people , which constituted the political state as a matter of general concern , that is , as a real state , necessarily smashed all estates , corporations , guilds , and privileges , since they were all manifestations of the separation of the people from the community . The political revolution thereby abolished the political character of civil society . It broke up civil society into its simple component parts ; on the one hand , the individuals ; on the other hand , the material and spiritual elements constituting the content of the life and social position of these individuals . It set free the political spirit , which had been , as it were , split up , partitioned , and dispersed in the various blind alleys of feudal society . It gathered the dispersed parts of the political spirit , freed it from its intermixture with civil life , and established it as the sphere of the community , the general concern of the nation , ideally independent of those particular elements of civil life . A person's distinct activity and distinct situation in life were reduced to a merely individual significance . They no longer constituted the general relation of the individual to the state as a whole . Public affairs as such , on the other hand , became the general affair of each individual , and the political function became the individual's general function . But , the completion of the idealism of the state was at the same time the completion of the materialism of civil society . Throwing off the political yoke meant at the same time throwing off the bonds which restrained the egoistic spirit of civil society . Political emancipation was , at the same time , the emancipation of civil society from politics , from having even the semblance of a universal content . Feudal society was resolved into its basic element – man , but man as he really formed its basis – egoistic man . This man , the member of civil society , is thus the basis , the precondition , of the political state . He is recognized as such by this state in the rights of man . The liberty of egoistic man and the recognition of this liberty , however , is rather the recognition of the unrestrained movement of the spiritual and material elements which form the content of his life . Hence , man was not freed from religion , he received religious freedom . He was not freed from property , he received freedom to own property . He was not freed from the egoism of business , he received freedom to engage in business . The establishment of the political state and the dissolution of civil society into independent individuals – whose relation with one another on law , just as the relations of men in the system of estates and guilds depended on privilege – is accomplished by one and the same act . Man as a member of civil society , unpolitical man , inevitably appears , however , as the natural man . The "" rights of man "" appears as "" natural rights , "" because conscious activity is concentrated on the political act . Egoistic man is the passive result of the dissolved society , a result that is simply found in existence , an object of immediate certainty , therefore a natural object . The political revolution resolves civil life into its component parts , without revolutionizing these components themselves or subjecting them to criticism . It regards civil society , the world of needs , labor , private interests , civil law , as the basis of its existence , as a precondition not requiring further substantiation and therefore as its natural basis . Finally , man as a member of civil society is held to be man in his sensuous , individual , immediate existence , whereas political man is only abstract , artificial man , man as an allegorical , juridical person . The real man is recognized only in the shape of the egoistic individual , the true man is recognized only in the shape of the abstract citizen . Therefore , Rousseau correctly described the abstract idea of political man as follows : "" Whoever dares undertake to establish a people's institutions must feel himself capable of changing , as it were , human nature , of transforming each individual , who by himself is a complete and solitary whole , into a part of a larger whole , from which , in a sense , the individual receives his life and his being , of substituting a limited and mental existence for the physical and independent existence . He has to take from man his own powers , and give him in exchange alien powers which he can not employ without the help of other men . "" All emancipation is a reduction of the human world and relationships to man himself . Political emancipation is the reduction of man , on the one hand , to a member of civil society , to an egoistic , independent individual , and , on the other hand , to a citizen , a juridical person . Only when the real , individual man re-absorbs in himself the abstract citizen , and as an individual human being has become a species-being in his everyday life , in his particular work , and in his particular situation , only when man has recognized and organized his "" own powers "" as social powers , and , consequently , no longer separates social power from himself in the shape of political power , only then will human emancipation have been accomplished . II Bruno Bauer , "" The Capacity of Present-day Jews and Christians to Become Free , "" Einundzwanzig Bogen aus der Schweiz , pp. 56-71 It is in this form that Bauer deals with the relation between the Jewish and the Christian religions , and also with their relation to criticism . Their relation to criticism is their relation "" to the capacity to become free . "" The result arrived at is : "" The Christian has to surmount only one stage , namely , that of his religion , in order to give up religion altogether , "" and therefore become free . "" The Jew , on the other hand , has to break not only with his Jewish nature , but also with the development towards perfecting his religion , a development which has remained alien to him . "" ( p. 71 ) Thus , Bauer here transforms the question of Jewish emancipation into a purely religious question . The theological problem as to whether the Jew or the Christian has the better prospect of salvation is repeated here in the enlightened form : which of them is more capable of emancipation . No longer is the question asked : Is it Judaism or Christianity that makes a man free ? On the contrary , the question is now : Which makes man freer , the negation of Judaism or the negation of Christianity ? "" If the Jews want to become free , they should profess belief not in Christianity , but in the dissolution of Christianity , in the dissolution of religion in general , that is to say , in enlightenment , criticism , and its consequences , free humanity . "" ( p. 70 ) For the Jew , it is still a matter of a profession of faith , but no longer a profession of belief in Christianity , but of belief in Christianity in dissolution . Bauer demands of the Jews that they should break with the essence of the Christian religion , a demand which , as he says himself , does not arise out of the development of Judaism . Since Bauer , at the end of his work on the Jewish question , had conceived Judaism only as crude religious criticism of Christianity , and therefore saw in it "" merely "" a religious significance , it could be foreseen that the emancipation of the Jews , too , would be transformed into a philosophical-theological act . Bauer considers that the ideal , abstract nature of the Jew , his religion , is his entire nature . Hence , he rightly concludes : "" The Jew contributes nothing to mankind if he himself disregards his narrow law , "" if he invalidates his entire Judaism . ( p. 65 ) Accordingly , the relation between Jews and Christians becomes the following : the sole interest of the Christian in the emancipation of the Jew is a general human interest , a theoretical interest . Judaism is a fact that offends the religious eye of the Christian . As soon as his eye ceases to be religious , this fact ceases to be offensive . The emancipation of the Jew is , in itself , not a task for the Christian . The Jew , on the other hand , in order to emancipate himself , has to carry out not only his own work , but also that of the Christian – i . e . , the Critique of the Evangelical History of the Synoptics and the Life of Jesus , etc. "" It is up to them to deal with it : they themselves will decide their fate ; but history is not to be trifled with . "" ( p. 71 ) We are trying to break with the theological formulation of the question . For us , the question of the Jew's capacity for emancipation becomes the question : What particular social element has to be overcome in order to abolish Judaism ? For the present-day Jew's capacity for emancipation is the relation of Judaism to the emancipation of the modern world . This relation necessarily results from the special position of Judaism in the contemporary enslaved world . Let us consider the actual , worldly Jew – not the Sabbath Jew , as Bauer does , but the everyday Jew . Let us not look for the secret of the Jew in his religion , but let us look for the secret of his religion in the real Jew . What is the secular basis of Judaism ? Practical need , self-interest . What is the worldly religion of the Jew ? Huckstering . What is his worldly God ? Money . Very well then ! Emancipation from huckstering and money , consequently from practical , real Judaism , would be the self-emancipation of our time . An organization of society which would abolish the preconditions for huckstering , and therefore the possibility of huckstering , would make the Jew impossible . His religious consciousness would be dissipated like a thin haze in the real , vital air of society . On the other hand , if the Jew recognizes that this practical nature of his is futile and works to abolish it , he extricates himself from his previous development and works for human emancipation as such and turns against the supreme practical expression of human self-estrangement . We recognize in Judaism , therefore , a general anti-social element of the present time , an element which through historical development – to which in this harmful respect the Jews have zealously contributed – has been brought to its present high level , at which it must necessarily begin to disintegrate . In the final analysis , the emancipation of the Jews is the emancipation of mankind from Judaism . The Jew has already emancipated himself in a Jewish way . "" The Jew , who in Vienna , for example , is only tolerated , determines the fate of the whole Empire by his financial power . The Jew , who may have no rights in the smallest German state , decides the fate of Europe . While corporations and guilds refuse to admit Jews , or have not yet adopted a favorable attitude towards them , the audacity of industry mocks at the obstinacy of the material institutions . "" ( Bruno Bauer , The Jewish Question , p. 114 ) This is no isolated fact . The Jew has emancipated himself in a Jewish manner , not only because he has acquired financial power , but also because , through him and also apart from him , money has become a world power and the practical Jewish spirit has become the practical spirit of the Christian nations . The Jews have emancipated themselves insofar as the Christians have become Jews . Captain Hamilton , for example , reports : "" The devout and politically free inhabitant of New England is a kind of Laocoön who makes not the least effort to escape from the serpents which are crushing him . Mammon is his idol which he adores not only with his lips but with the whole force of his body and mind . In his view the world is no more than a Stock Exchange , and he is convinced that he has no other destiny here below than to become richer than his neighbor . Trade has seized upon all his thoughts , and he has no other recreation than to exchange objects . When he travels he carries , so to speak , his goods and his counter on his back and talks only of interest and profit . If he loses sight of his own business for an instant it is only in order to pry into the business of his competitors . "" Indeed , in North America , the practical domination of Judaism over the Christian world has achieved as its unambiguous and normal expression that the preaching of the Gospel itself and the Christian ministry have become articles of trade , and the bankrupt trader deals in the Gospel just as the Gospel preacher who has become rich goes in for business deals . "" The man who you see at the head of a respectable congregation began as a trader ; his business having failed , he became a minister . The other began as a priest but as soon as he had some money at his disposal he left the pulpit to become a trader . In the eyes of very many people , the religious ministry is a veritable business career . "" ( Beaumont , op . cit. , pp. 185,186 ) According to Bauer , it is "" a fictitious state of affairs when in theory the Jew is deprived of political rights , whereas in practice he has immense power and exerts his political influence en gros , although it is curtailed en détail . "" ( Die Judenfrage , p. 114 ) The contradiction that exists between the practical political power of the Jew and his political rights is the contradiction between politics and the power of money in general . Although theoretically the former is superior to the latter , in actual fact politics has become the serf of financial power . Judaism has held its own alongside Christianity , not only as religious criticism of Christianity , not only as the embodiment of doubt in the religious derivation of Christianity , but equally because the practical Jewish spirit , Judaism , has maintained itself and even attained its highest development in Christian society . The Jew , who exists as a distinct member of civil society , is only a particular manifestation of the Judaism of civil society . Judaism continues to exist not in spite of history , but owing to history . The Jew is perpetually created by civil society from its own entrails . What , in itself , was the basis of the Jewish religion ? Practical need , egoism . The monotheism of the Jew , therefore , is in reality the polytheism of the many needs , a polytheism which makes even the lavatory an object of divine law . Practical need , egoism , is the principle of civil society , and as such appears in pure form as soon as civil society has fully given birth to the political state . The god of practical need and self-interest is money . Money is the jealous god of Israel , in face of which no other god may exist . Money degrades all the gods of man – and turns them into commodities . Money is the universal self-established value of all things . It has , therefore , robbed the whole world – both the world of men and nature – of its specific value . Money is the estranged essence of man's work and man's existence , and this alien essence dominates him , and he worships it . The god of the Jews has become secularized and has become the god of the world . The bill of exchange is the real god of the Jew . His god is only an illusory bill of exchange . The view of nature attained under the domination of private property and money is a real contempt for , and practical debasement of , nature ; in the Jewish religion , nature exists , it is true , but it exists only in imagination . It is in this sense that [ in a 1524 pamphlet ] Thomas Münzer declares it intolerable "" that all creatures have been turned into property , the fishes in the water , the birds in the air , the plants on the earth ; the creatures , too , must become free . "" Contempt for theory , art , history , and for man as an end in himself , which is contained in an abstract form in the Jewish religion , is the real , conscious standpoint , the virtue of the man of money . The species-relation itself , the relation between man and woman , etc. , becomes an object of trade ! The woman is bought and sold . The chimerical nationality of the Jew is the nationality of the merchant , of the man of money in general . The groundless law of the Jew is only a religious caricature of groundless morality and right in general , of the purely formal rites with which the world of self-interest surrounds itself . Here , too , man's supreme relation is the legal one , his relation to laws that are valid for him not because they are laws of his own will and nature , but because they are the dominant laws and because departure from them is avenged . Jewish Jesuitism , the same practical Jesuitism which Bauer discovers in the Talmud , is the relation of the world of self-interest to the laws governing that world , the chief art of which consists in the cunning circumvention of these laws . Indeed , the movement of this world within its framework of laws is bound to be a continual suspension of law . Judaism could not develop further as a religion , could not develop further theoretically , because the world outlook of practical need is essentially limited and is completed in a few strokes . By its very nature , the religion of practical need could find its consummation not in theory , but only in practice , precisely because its truth is practice . Judaism could not create a new world ; it could only draw the new creations and conditions of the world into the sphere of its activity , because practical need , the rationale of which is self-interest , is passive and does not expand at will , but finds itself enlarged as a result of the continuous development of social conditions . Judaism reaches its highest point with the perfection of civil society , but it is only in the Christian world that civil society attains perfection . Only under the dominance of Christianity , which makes all national , natural , moral , and theoretical conditions extrinsic to man , could civil society separate itself completely from the life of the state , sever all the species-ties of man , put egoism and selfish need in the place of these species-ties , and dissolve the human world into a world of atomistic individuals who are inimically opposed to one another . Christianity sprang from Judaism . It has merged again in Judaism . From the outset , the Christian was the theorizing Jew , the Jew is , therefore , the practical Christian , and the practical Christian has become a Jew again . Christianity had only in semblance overcome real Judaism . It was too noble-minded , too spiritualistic to eliminate the crudity of practical need in any other way than by elevation to the skies . Christianity is the sublime thought of Judaism , Judaism is the common practical application of Christianity , but this application could only become general after Christianity as a developed religion had completed theoretically the estrangement of man from himself and from nature . Only then could Judaism achieve universal dominance and make alienated man and alienated nature into alienable , vendible objects subjected to the slavery of egoistic need and to trading . Selling [ Veräußerung ] is the practical aspect of alienation [ Entäußerung ] . Just as man , as long as he is in the grip of religion , is able to objectify his essential nature only by turning it into something alien , something fantastic , so under the domination of egoistic need he can be active practically , and produce objects in practice , only by putting his products , and his activity , under the domination of an alien being , and bestowing the significance of an alien entity – money – on them . In its perfected practice , Christian egoism of heavenly bliss is necessarily transformed into the corporal egoism of the Jew , heavenly need is turned into world need , subjectivism into self-interest . We explain the tenacity of the Jew not by his religion , but , on the contrary , by the human basis of his religion – practical need , egoism . Since in civil society the real nature of the Jew has been universally realized and secularized , civil society could not convince the Jew of the unreality of his religious nature , which is indeed only the ideal aspect of practical need . Consequently , not only in the Pentateuch and the Talmud , but in present-day society we find the nature of the modern Jew , and not as an abstract nature but as one that is in the highest degree empirical , not merely as a narrowness of the Jew , but as the Jewish narrowness of society . Once society has succeeded in abolishing the empirical essence of Judaism – huckstering and its preconditions – the Jew will have become impossible , because his consciousness no longer has an object , because the subjective basis of Judaism , practical need , has been humanized , and because the conflict between man's individual-sensuous existence and his species-existence has been abolished . The social emancipation of the Jew is the emancipation of society from Judaism . </doc>

Advertisments Feature Celebrating the Future of Libraries with the ALA Special Focus : National Library Week : April 8-14 , 2012 by Jillian Bergsma I spent most of my school years devouring nearly every book my public library had to offer , though I certainly never ventured into the adult section ( or as I thought of it , "" the Restricted Section "" a la Harry Potter ) . For me , the library was a place of discovery , peace , and a lot of really good books . But with the book industry in turmoil , where do today's libraries stand ? "" The theme this year is ' You Belong @ Your Library , ' "" Raphael said of the ALA's current endeavor . "" We are looking at how libraries make connections with different parts of a community and we want to highlight how libraries are welcoming gathering places for people from all different backgrounds . "" A perfect example of this goal in action are the One Book , One Community programs taking place all over the nation . Raphael told me about one of the programs currently taking place in San Jose , CA . "" Two or three libraries systems joined together to do a program called ' Muslim and American , ' "" she explained . "" The center is a single book ( The Muslim Next Door by Sumbul Ali-Karamali ) , and the libraries have been doing tremendous programming about issues regarding being Muslim in America . They have hosted professors from different universities , screened films , and more . In this way , our libraries are educating people about current issues . "" Of course , the ALA ca n't do it all on their own . Like publishers , authors , and booksellers , libraries are challenged by changing technologies and our country's economic slump . "" The issues around technology continue to consume focus and resources of libraries because our world changing so rapidly , "" Raphael admitted . "" Another big issue is funding for public and school libraries . Due to the economic downturn , it can be difficult to keep libraries open long hours or invest in eBook technology . Luckily , there are library advocacy groups and programs that are focused on speaking out for the libraries where people get their access to technology , resources , and expertise . "" Despite these challenges , Raphael remains excited about the important services that our libraries provide . "" We helped people experiment with technology , as many libraries lend out eReaders to give people a chance to see if they like the technology . Libraries are also trying to make it possible to deliver traditional services available electronically . For example , book groups can check out books in print or eBook formats . "" In addition to meeting the demands of the eBook market , libraries are also working on developing mobile apps and creating other avenues to appeal to community members . "" Libraries are very good at adapting to change , "" Raphael told me . "" It 's the only way they stay relevant from generation to generation . That adaptation means that we must listen to our communities to understand their aspirations and priorities . One of the challenges libraries have is that teenagers drift away from libraries after elementary school , so we have been talking to teens and creating spaces and services that attract young adults to the library . "" The ALA and libraries around the country are certainly working hard to maintain their standing in our communities . Between being a place for young children to develop a love of reading , a space for research and education , and a haven for bibliophiles , libraries have habitually transcended generations and technologies ( they 've been around for hundreds and hundreds of years , after all ) . Personally , I ca n't imagine a world without buildings full of books , and neither can Raphael . "" There has been speculation by some that the physical library is going to disappear , "" Raphael said . "" But if you go and visit libraries you 'll see the use is rising . Our libraries are becoming centers of communities , as there are fewer and fewer places where people can gather together . There have been huge investments in public library systems in cities like Los Angeles , Seattle , and Chicago – these areas have totally rebuilt library systems because people need that common space to come together . "" Library lovers can rest easy , as our libraries are here to stay ... with a little help from their friends .

And be sure to contact your local library to see how you can celebrate National Library Week ! * * * * * </doc>

350,A8,"Overcoming hurdles in negotiation the Australian way 28 Jun 2004 On 2 June 2004 over 30 delegates attended a whole-day workshop at CEDR run by Professor John Wade . Lecturing at Bond University in Queensland , John is a leader in three fields in Australia : mediator , academic focussing on ADR , and law-lecturer . The workshop concentrated on overcoming common hurdles in negotiation . By not focussing solely on mediation , he stimulated an audience drawn mostly from the business sector with techniques for progressing and unblocking negotiations . Feedback from delegates was universally complimentary . Some particularly liked John's checklists and crib cards . Others enjoyed insights into the psychology of negotiation . John writes regularly in the Bond University Dispute Resolution News e-mail newsletter which can be found at www . b ond . e du . a u / law / centres / drc / newsletter For information about other seminars or workshops aimed at the business sector , please contact Terry Jones at CEDR ( tjones @ cedr . c o . u k ) who is always pleased to talk about cutting the cost of conflict and the use of mediation and related techniques in the business sector . </doc>

1662,A16,"Planos ( Planes ) is a chamber-music composition by the Mexican composer Silvestre Revueltas , also slightly enlarged and scored for full orchestra and published under its alternate title , Danza geométrica ( Geometric Dance ) . Both versions were composed in 1934 , and the scores are both dedicated to the architect Ricardo Ortega . From at least as early as 1926 , the architect Ricardo Ortega had encouraged Revueltas to take his composing more seriously , and showed some of his early scores to Edgard Varèse . When , in 1934 , Revueltas composed Planos with a structure clearly alluding to architectural models , he dedicated the score to his architect friend . Although Revueltas is often regarded as a Mexican nationalist with strong populist leanings , Planos contains no obvious reference to folklore . It is one of his purest musical works , in which the use of any folk-like musical elements is almost imperceptible ( Sánchez-Gutierrez 1996 , 7 , 48 ) . His references to geometry , though more programmatic than Varèse's , nevertheless indicate a kinship with the older composer's work in a shared overall linear character . Revueltas was certainly aware of Varèse's music and aesthetics in the 1920s , when the two composers had exchanged correspondence ( Sánchez-Gutierrez 1996 , 14 , 29 – 30 ) . The chamber-music version was completed in March 1934 , and was reorchestrated in June of the same year for full orchestra ( Slonimsky 1945 , 250 ) . Revueltas described the work as functional architecture , which does not exclude sentiment . Melodic fragments derive from the same impulse , the same emotion as my other works ; they sing in persistent rhythms , ever in motion ; they produce sonorities that may seem strange because they are not common . My rhythms and sonorities are reminiscent of other rhythms and sonorities , just as building material in architecture is identical with any building material , but it serves for constructions that are different in meaning , form , and expression . ( Revueltas 1989 , 212 – 13 , translated in Slonimsky 1945 , 248 ) The chamber version , published as Planos , is scored for a nonet : B ♭ clarinet , B ♭ bass clarinet , bassoon , C trumpet , piano , 2 violins , cello , and double bass . This heterogenous scoring , reminiscent of provincial bands , resembles those of other Revueltas scores , such as Alcancías and Colorines ( both from 1932 ) , Toccata sin Fuga ( 1933 ) , and the slightly later Homenaje a Federico García Lorca ( Sánchez-Gutierrez 1996 , 37 – 38 ) . The large-orchestra version , published as Danza geométrica , is scored for piccolo , 2 flutes , 2 E ♭ clarinets , 2 B ♭ clarinets , B ♭ bass clarinet , 3 bassoons ( 3rd doubling contrabassoon ) , 4 horns , 4 trumpets , 3 trombones , tuba , percussion ( 4 players : xylophone , glockenspiel , large and small tamtams , bass drum , slapstick , cymbal , large gong , tambourine , and tubular bells ) , 2 pianos , and strings . The larger ensemble seems to have required a temporal expansion as well . Two sections in the first half are extended and rewritten with newly added melodic material , the return of the opening material at the end is recast , and occasional motivic repetitions are added throughout ( Archibald 1966 ) . Planos departs from the ternary A – B – A form Revueltas habitually employed in single-movement works . Instead , it is freely structured and through-composed ( Hernández 2009 , 80 ) . It is constructed in modular , mosaic fashion from six generating motives , each with several variant forms . These motives are manipulated and juxtaposed , resulting in their continual re-contextualization ( Sánchez-Gutierrez 1996 , 29 , 33 – 34 , 122 – 24 ) . The identity of each of these motivic groups is intensified by the use of particular timbres , intensities , articulations , registers , melodic contours , meters , rhythmic patterns , and durations . Revueltas combines them into a whole through the use of sequencing , double and triple superimposition , stretto , fragmentation , extension , and shadowing , united by a complex design of ostinatos and rhythmic planes . The resulting musical discourse is often both flowing and abrupt , "" a faithful mirror of the daily battle within the conflicting imagery of his inner and outer worlds "" ( Kolb Neuhaus 1998 ) . When the influence of Igor Stravinsky on the orchestral version was suggested , the composer reacted : It was performed last year . Opinion was divided . Some thought that it was Stravinsky ; who knows what Stravinsky would have thought . Because it uses two pianos and some gongs , the chords at the beginning and end recall the sonority of the final chords of Les noces by Stravinsky ; however , they are neither the same notes nor the same intervals , which probably bestows upon them an even stronger resemblance .

1311,A1,"There was a time , not so long ago , when people got their e-mail at their desks , on their computers . Before the influence of Blackberries and iPhones , e-mail messaging was a reasonably simple affair , with a couple of servers and some simple software running the whole operation . This spring will be the dawn of a new era , at least from the perspective of those in Information Technology who manage the university's e-mail infrastructure . In response to the growing use of mobile devices and a need to streamline the university's e-mail and calendar applications , this spring IT will launch a new behind-the-scenes software solution , an upgrade that will replace the systems in use for the last several years and allow for improved integration with smartphones and other mobile devices . Although e-mail continues to be a primary means of communication on campus – IT estimates their servers deliver about 100,000 non-spam messages a day to the university 's almost 2,000 e-mail users – how people get their e-mail has shifted dramatically in recent years . While the growing population of mobile device users can access both e-mail and Oracle calendar accounts , the interfaces involved lack the user-friendliness and full functionality of desktop versions . And some services , like a centralized address book , are simply not available with the university's current stand-alone solutions . "" Streamlining communication and scheduling functionality will eliminate these issues as well as the need for users to log into separate systems , duplicate information and make changes across multiple systems , "" says Jerry Latter , associate vice president for information technology . Rockefeller University's existing mail-processing software , called Sendmail , will become obsolete this year when the university's vendors discontinue support of the application . Though IT has been aware of this eventuality and looking to integrate services for several years , until recently the market offered no single solution that was both affordable and feasible for Rockefeller's multi-platform environment : about 60 percent Macintosh and 40 percent Windows machines . Microsoft Exchange , one of the world's most widely used messaging and scheduling platforms , was always one of the top choices . Numerous institutions , including Weill Cornell Medical College , Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center and the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center , are already using or are in the process of implementing it . "" Many people on campus who used Exchange in their last workplace have also requested it here , "" says Mr. Latter . Having established the system at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory , where he last worked , Mr. Latter started running an experimental Exchange server at Rockefeller in 2002 , testing it for potential problems . Last year IT administration narrowed the choice down to five systems . Comparison of features , functionality , scalability and vendor business solidity led to the choice of MS Exchange ; the IT advisory committee agreed to the decision last spring and it was discussed with Academic Council last summer . In addition to synchronization with major mobile devices , Exchange offers the ability to delegate account access , built-in direct push e-mail technology ( helpful for full e-mail functionality on smartphones ) for many devices , a user-friendly Web interface and advanced iPhone support . It is also compatible with the university's Avaya telecommunications system , which will eventually permit what is known as unified messaging – voice access to data files and electronic access to voicemail . IT will begin enlisting members of the campus community for a test run of the new program in the spring , and the rollout will happen over the course of 2009 , first the e-mail and address book functions and later the calendar module , as IT migrates one lab / office at a time . Full use of the system's calendar and address book will require some on campus to switch from their previous e-mail clients to Outlook ( PC ) or Entourage ( Mac ) . IT will host information sessions in late spring to give department and lab administrators training on advanced features . </doc>

1442,A7,"This declaration is heard daily across the land from first-time entrepreneurs . To the uninitiated it sounds impressive and even glamorous to embark on such a path . However , to veteran entrepreneurs it 's a strong indication of the rookie's naivety and lack of understanding of the consequences of accepting money from outsiders . While venture capital can be a tremendous boon to a tiny fraction of the companies pursuing it , in the vast majority of cases it presents the entrepreneur with a "" Faustian Bargain "" . Venture capital brings with it tremendous meddling and pressure from venture capitalists who in this day and age typically lack both the operating and industry depth of their predecessors . The effect of this on fledgling ventures is loss of control by the entrepreneur which then frequently leads to bad--and sometimes fatal--business decisions being made . Here are ten drawbacks of venture capital for the entrepreneur to mull over before making a decision to pursue it . The decision to chase venture capital is often a tempting distraction from the much more complex and important entrepreneurial tasks of creating something to sell and persuading someone to buy it . The pursuit of venture capital is sometimes a means by which to postpone the day of reckoning when the marketplace finally decides if the idea will fly . Venture capitalists behave like sheep investing only in whatever industry happens to be the flavor of the month . Everyone else need not apply . Rookie entrepreneurs talking to venture capitalists expose their ideas to increased risk because they can not distinguish between genuine interest and mere "" brain-sucking "" to uncover corporate secrets . Once negotiations begin venture capitalists will typically stall in order to push cash short companies to the brink of bankruptcy as a way of extracting additional equity and concessions at the last moment . Terms demanded by greedy venture capitalists frequently work to erode and ultimately destroy the founding team's motivation and commitment to building a successful company . With the first dollar of venture capital accepted the entrepreneur's control slips away to 28-year-old MBA wonder-boys with only the shallowest of operating experience . As soon as venture capitalists become involved the founder's role shifts from critical company building functions to preparing reports , attending endless meetings , writing memos , and hand-holding impatient and / or meddlesome investors . An infusion of capital often shifts the founding team's focus away from selling to spending money in an effort to placate venture capitalists who often confuse bulking-up staff and assets with real growth . Venture capital brings with it tremendous pressure to create a liquidity event but this frequently results in bad decisions being made to launch products too early or enter into the wrong markets . The venture capitalist's knee-jerk response to every problem faced by a portfolio company is to fire the founders and evade any personal responsibility for bad decisions . Here 's a bonus 11th reason why venture capital is bad . It is by far the most expensive money an entrepreneur can ever tap into . Let 's do the math to see why this is . Suppose you and a venture capitalist agree to a "" pre-money "" valuation of $ 1 million for your start-up , and the venture capitalist then invests $ 1 million for 50 % of the equity . After the investment , the company is said to have a "" post-money "" valuation of $ 2 million . Being 50 / 50 partners sounds acceptable , right ? Three years later the company is sold to a Fortune 500 corporation for $ 5 million . Do you and the venture capitalist each get $ 2 . 5 million from the proceeds ? Not on your Nellie ! The venture capitalist will have a so-called "" liquidation preference "" built into the original investment agreement which allows him to first take out 2 to 5 ( or more ) times his principal before anyone else sees a penny . So , let 's say that in this example he takes out $ 3 million ( i.e. , a "" 3X liquidation preference "" ) , plus any accrued dividends on his preferred stock . After exercising the liquidation preference and cashing in his dividends only $ 1 million is left . You , the founder , and your team , will then split this remaining money on a 50 / 50 basis with the venture capitalist . This is a simplified example of what happens . In real life the founder and her team would probably receive far less than even the $ 500 , 000 due to all the fine print clauses . The good news is that there is a wealth of academic research to support the contention that anyone wishing to build a company for the long term will be better off by not utilizing venture capital . As a result savvy entrepreneurs devise startup strategies that allow them to focus on generating cash flow during the first year instead of chasing venture capital . Conversely , naive "" entrepreneurial wanna-bees "" , such as those we observed in the recent dotcom era , have a philosophy which can be summed up as , "" Give me X million dollars or this idea is dead ! "" . If your entrepreneurial goal is a company "" built to last "" it 's usually best to forgo venture capital . On the other hand , if your goal is a company "" built to flip "" for a fast buck use venture capital if it is available to you . </doc>

29,A4,"Ezra 1 Cyrus Helps the Exiles to Return 1 In the first year of Cyrus king of Persia , in order to fulfill the word of the LORD spoken by Jeremiah , the LORD moved the heart of Cyrus king of Persia to make a proclamation throughout his realm and to put it in writing : 2 "" This is what Cyrus king of Persia says : "" ' The LORD , the God of heaven , has given me all the kingdoms of the earth and he has appointed me to build a temple for him at Jerusalem in Judah . 3 Anyone of his people among you – may his God be with him , and let him go up to Jerusalem in Judah and build the temple of the LORD , the God of Israel , the God who is in Jerusalem . 4 And the people of any place where survivors may now be living are to provide him with silver and gold , with goods and livestock , and with freewill offerings for the temple of God in Jerusalem . ' "" 5 Then the family heads of Judah and Benjamin , and the priests and Levites – everyone whose heart God had moved – prepared to go up and build the house of the LORD in Jerusalem . 6 All their neighbors assisted them with articles of silver and gold , with goods and livestock , and with valuable gifts , in addition to all the freewill offerings . 7 Moreover , King Cyrus brought out the articles belonging to the temple of the LORD , which Nebuchadnezzar had carried away from Jerusalem and had placed in the temple of his god . [ a ] 8 Cyrus king of Persia had them brought by Mithredath the treasurer , who counted them out to Sheshbazzar the prince of Judah . 9 This was the inventory : gold dishes 30 silver dishes 1,000 silver pans [ b ] 29 10 gold bowls 30 matching silver bowls 410 other articles 1,000 11 In all , there were 5,400 articles of gold and of silver .

411,A9,"1 . The employer must draw up a plan to decide who will be kept on and who will be made redundant and why . 2 . The employer must inform the workforce as soon as possible , so they have a chance put forward alternatives or apply for other jobs with the current employer or with another employer . 3 . The employer should consider any proposals that the employee's or their representatives make as an alternative to redundancy . 4 . The employer should decide as soon as possible how many employees will be made redundant . Consulting 1 . The employer must consult the employee's representatives ( this includes Unions ) if 20 or more people are going to be made redundant . 2 . The employer must discuss alternatives to redundancy and the selection criteria for redundancy . 3 . The employer can carry on the redundancy procedures whilst the consultation is going on ( for example , sending out redundancy notices to the effected employees ) . However , the employer should not issue redundancy notices before he has had a chance to consult properly . 4 .. If the employer does not consult properly the Employment Tribunal can make the employer pay a ' Protective Award ' . This states that the employer must keep the employees on and must pay their wages for a certain amount of time ( whether they actually remain working or not ) . The length of this Protective Award period is usually fairly short . Department of Trade and Industry The employer must consult the Department of Trade and Industry ( D. T. I. ) 30 days before dismissal if they are going to make between 20 - 99 employees redundant . Or 90 days if over 100 are to be dismissed . One of the reasons for this is so that the DTI can compile accurate employment statistics and records . Selection Procedure If a group of employees are selected for redundancy the employer must show what type of work they do and why the demand for that work has decreased or stopped completely . If the amount of work has decreased so that only some of the employees within a group are selected , the employer must show how they picked those unlucky ones . The employer must show in detail the selection procedure and criteria . This can range from "" last in first out "" to a scoring system , with the employer giving points for certain job skills . The selection criteria should not be based upon an individual's view of each employee ( for example , what the personnel manager thinks ) Once the criteria has been agreed it should be kept to . The employer should also try and agree the selection criteria with the employees' representatives or Union . The selection procedure and criteria can not be based upon unfair reasons such as : Trade Union membership or activity . If the selection criteria is based upon Race , Disability or Sex the effected employee can claim under Unfair Dismissal or the relevant discrimination law . The employer must consult each effected employee before dismissal notices are handed out , so that there is a chance of real consultation and time for the employee to respond . The selected group may change due to the consultation process . </doc>

1546,A4,"Necropolitan Necropolitans are humanoids who renounce life and embrace undeath in a special ritual called the Ritual of Crucimigration . A necropolitan's skin is dry , withered , and powdery . Its eyes are as pale as driven snow , and as lifeless . It continues to dress in the fashion it preferred while living . Necropolitans are considered citizens of the little-known city of Nocturnus , but if their nature is revealed elsewhere , they are feared and hunted like common monsters . Creating a Necropolitan Resist Control ( Ex ) : Necropolitans have a +2 profane bonus on their Will saving throws to resist the effect of a control undead spell . Unnatural Resilience ( Ex ) : Necropolitans automatically heal hit point damage and ability damage at the same rate as a living creature . The Heal skill has no effect on necropolitans ; however , negative energy ( such as an inflict spell ) heals them . Abilities : Same as the base creature , except that as undead creatures , necropolitans have no Constitution score . Level Adjustment : Same as the base creature . ( Becoming a necropolitan involves losing a level - see Ritual of Crucimigration , below - so the advantages of the undead type cancel out what would other wise be a larger adjustment . ) Ritual of Crucumigration Any living humanoid or monstrous humanoid can petition for consideration to undergo the Ritual of Crucimigration , which ( if successful ) enables the creature to become a necropolitan . The petition for consideration requires a fee of 3,000 gp and a written plea . The Ritual : The first part of the ritual requires the placement of the petitioner on a standing pole . Cursed nails are used to affix the petitioner , and then the pole is lifted into place . The resultant excruciating pain that shoots like molten metal through the petitioner's fingers and up the arms is not what finally ends the petitioner's mortal life , however , since death usually comes from asphyxiation and heart failure . As petitioners feel death's chill enter their bodies , many have second thoughts , but it is far too late to go back - the cursed nails and chanting of the ritual ensures that the Crucimigration is completed . The ceremony that lasts for 24 hours - the usual time it takes for the petitioner to perish . During this period , two or three zombie servitors keep up a chant initiated by the ritual leader when the petitioner is first placed into position . Upon hearing the petitioner's last breath , the ritual leader calls forth the names of evil powers and gods to forge a link with the Negative Energy Plane , and then impales the petitioner . Dying , the petitioner is reborn as a necropolitan , dead but animate . Game Effect : Immediately upon opening its undead eyes , a new necropolitan loses a level as if the spell raise dead had been used on it and it was alive instead of animate . ( If the subject has no levels to lose , it is simply destroyed . ) It then also loses an additional 1,000 XP . If the loss of this much XP forces the necropolitan to lose another level , then it loses another level . No spell , not even restoration , can restore this lost XP . Petitioners may not spend experience points they do n't have - if the level loss and the 1,000 XP cost drains a creature to 0 XP or less , it is destroyed , turned to dust , and can never he raised or revived again using any means . If the ritual is interrupted before it is completed , the petitioner is merely dead . </doc>

1357,A1,"The Southampton Animal Shelter Foundation was founded in 2010 as a call to action when the town decided it could no longer care for the animals at the town shelter premises . Not only were the 225 animals currently housed there in jeopardy , so were all others that would be found . It was the selfless financial , emotional and personal determination of their Board of Directors that initiated this remarkable new rescue organization . The President of the Southampton Animal Shelter Foundation , Jonathan McCann , is totally absorbed in the daily activities of the shelter , as are all of their officers and Board members . When he speaks of the challenges of meeting the needs of animals at the shelter , he frequently mentions the past and present "" residents "" by name . Jonathan resides in Sag Harbor on his bayside estate with his horses , dogs , guineas , parrots and numerous other companion pets . Most notable among this group's attributes are the quality , commitment and attitude of the staff . Each staff member has been selected and trained to strive for perfection . No animal is too great a challenge to invest love , diagnosis , and rehabilitation . When Chance , a disobedient dog , was left at the shelter and diagnosed as deaf , the entire staff learned sign language to communicate with him . Chance now lives with his new adoptive family that leaned his sign language , as well ! The Southampton Animal Shelter Foundation offers a low-cost spay / neuter clinic to help combat pet overpopulation . All privately owned pit bull type dogs are spayed or neutered free of charge . Dog obedience classes are also offered to the public . The Shelter is a 501 ( c ) 3 non-profit organization relying on the generosity of individuals and businesses to help us save lives at the adoption center and provide much-needed programs that benefit homeless pets , your contributions will be greatly appreciated . </doc>

799,A16,"What are stem cells ? Stem cells are the foundation cells for every organ , tissue and cell in the body . They are undifferentiated , "" blank "" cells that do not yet have a specific function . Under proper conditions , they have the potential to develop into many different cell types in the body . Additionally , stem cells are self-sustaining and can replicate themselves for long periods of time . These unique characteristics make stem cells very promising for supplying cells to treat debilitating diseases like Alzheimer's disease , cancer , Parkinson's disease , type-1 diabetes , spinal cord injury , stroke , burns , heart disease , osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis . Research is now being conducted on both adult and embryonic stem cells to determine the characteristics and potential of both to cure disease . </doc>

1224,A8,"Southern claims 96 % of conductors ' signed up ' for new role Southern wants drivers , rather than conductors , to operate carriage doors at certain times Nearly all conductors have signed up for a controversial new on-board supervisor role on Southern trains from January , the rail company has said . The conductors had until last Friday to respond to Southern's deadline , and 215 - 96 % of those required - have done so . The change to the role has caused a bitter dispute with the unions and has led to a series of walkouts . Mick Cash , RMT general secretary , said nothing had changed , members remained "" rock solid "" and the "" fight goes on "" . The latest 48-hour strike ended at midnight on Saturday and further stoppages are planned . Angie Doll , Southern's passenger services director , said : "" We 've now got over 200 conductors signed up ... disproving the union's claims that support is rock solid . "" RMT general secretary Mick cash responded : "" Nothing has changed in terms of the core issues at the heart of this dispute . It 's about basic rail safety and access to transport services for all members of our community . "" That ground has not shifted an inch thanks to the sheer pig-headed attitude of Southern Rail and their government pay masters . "" Our members remain rock solid ... and will not be bribed , bullied or beaten . That fight goes on . "" ' Spiteful act ' The new on-board supervisor roles will focus on "" customer service "" and move the operation of closing doors to the driver . A further 222 people will remain in their existing roles as conductors on certain services , Southern said . It is also planning to recruit a further 100 on-board supervisors to work across Southern and Gatwick Express services . Southern said the union leadership had "" stooped to a new low "" by calling a strike over Christmas , calling it a "" selfish , shameful and spiteful act "" . GTR , Southern's parent company , said its offer to the RMT to settle the dispute had now been formally withdrawn . Meanwhile , Aslef , the UK's biggest rail union , has suspended a strike ballot among its Southern members , because of "" technical difficulties "" . The RMT union is also balloting its driver members for strikes , with voting closing on 18 November . </doc>

She did not want braces again so with 10 porcelain veneers , we provided her instant orthodontics . Now she has a smile that she is proud of and one that enhances her overall beauty ! Services Performed Karl had a lot of older dental work throughout his mouth that was failing . Due to trauma earlier in life , he lost his front tooth and had a porcelain with metal bridge placed that was unsightly . After his initial treatment conference , we decided that some of his surrounding front teeth should be addressed in order to give him the healthy and youthful smile that he once had . With all - porcelain crowns and a porcelain bridge , we gave this man the proper shape , size and colored teeth that he desired . This is a perfect example showing how advanced dentistry can improve older-style dental work . Services Performed Elaine had been waiting for years to address her smile . She knew she had many dental issues , but was very nervous about going to the dentist . Elaine had older crowns and several missing teeth and was looking for answers . Porcelain veneers and dental implants were the solutions to her cosmetic concerns . With sedation dentistry , we were able to give Elaine the smile she dreamed of without any anxiety or discomfort . Services Performed Bob came to us searching for a cosmetic solution for his severely worn-down teeth . As you can see , due to severe teeth grinding and older dental work , not only was his smile affected , but so was his entire bite . After showing Bob that his case was as much functional as it was cosmetic , he knew that it was important to address his bite as well as his smile . Services Performed Ashley was a severe grinder with numerous dental concerns . Even at her young age , the damage to her teeth was extensive and made her very self-conscious of her smile . When we discussed her options , porcelain veneers were the perfect solution to give her the smile she was looking for . Now she has the youthful and healthy smile that someone her age should have . Services Performed Dan came to our office concerned with the severe wear he had on his teeth . He felt that his smile "" looked old and worn down . "" Dan was only 35 years old and due to his severe grinding habit and TMJ Symptoms , his teeth were being destroyed . With a combination of porcelain veneers and all porcelain crowns , we rebuilt Danny's teeth and gave him the smile a man his age should have . Danny now has the confidence to smile again . Services Performed Stephanie arrived in "" temporary veneers "" from a dentist in Boston . She came to us for our opinion on her shocking situation . Stephanie's temporaries were appalling ! We showed her that our temporary veneers are identical versions of the final veneers , and she knew she was in the right place . With 8 porcelain veneers , we gave this stunning girl the smile that rightfully complimented her beauty ! Services Performed Tom had always been embarrassed of his smile . His teeth were stained from smoking and coffee , and he had older , failing dental work throughout his mouth . For years , he hid his smile in photos and even grew his mustache to hide his teeth . When he came to his initial treatment consultation hmurre was completely blown away when he learned about how porcelain veneers and crowns could give him the smile he was looking for . Services Performed Eve is a beautiful woman whose teeth had started to make her self-conscious of herself . Older dental work , normal wear and tear , and overall staining had made Eve realize that her smile was n't what it once was . She wanted to have that youthful smile she once had . With 10 porcelain veneers , Eve was given the smile she desired . Take a look at the improvement in Eve's smile , and how it has added to her overall beauty ! Services Performed John was referred to our office by his orthodontist to discuss smile makeover options . John had never been happy with the spacing between his teeth due to their alignment and size , nor the chipping away of previously placed bonding . With a combination of traditional orthodontic treatment and porcelain veneers we were able to close the remaining spaces between the teeth , improving their shape and color . Now John has the smile he always wanted . Services Performed Maria first came to our office looking for ways to improve the appearance of her smile . She was unsatisfied with the severe spacing and misalignment of her teeth . After discussing different treatment options Maria choose to pursue a combination of orthodontics , dental implants and porcelain veneers to complete her smile makeover . The final result is a beautiful , natural looking smile that compliments her vibrant personality . Services Performed Jason had debated about addressing his teeth for many years . He was never happy with the position , shape or color of his teeth and wanted a good solution to give him the confident smile he was looking for . After discussing his options with Dr. Haddad , together they decided that 10 porcelain veneers was the best treatment for him .

738,A1,"Women's Prisons There are 18 prisons in England and Wales which hold women prisoners . Not all are women's prisons - some hold women and men , but they do not have contact with one another . Three of the women's prisons are ' open ' prisons . Only women who are not regarded as a threat to public safety or a real escape risk are sent to the open prisons where security is less stringent and women are often able to work outside the prison . There is one women's prison in Scotland . Only six of the women's prisons take women who are waiting on remand - days , weeks or months - to be dealt with at court . Women's prisons vary from Victorian style prison wings like Larkhall to modern cabin-style accommodation .

382,A1,"' Fight poverty not wars ' : reflections from the Edinburgh march Jim Jepps reports from the scorching streets of Edinburgh I 've been told that Madonna began her set with her hit ' Music ' whose main refrain goes "" Music unites the rebel with the bourgeoisie . "" I can think of hardly any other song that sums up Live8 better than this . But if the ideas of the gig goers and TV viewers must have been mixed , what of those who actually came to the protests in Edinburgh ? Having spent the weekend diligently vox popping and discussing the mood there are some clear pictures emerging , of who is here and why . There are of course three main ' camps ' . The NGO / Make Poverty History crowd who range from ' let's hope Gordon makes some good decisions ' to a fairly clear , if fluffy , anti-capitalist consciousness . The opposite camp is the dissent / indymedia crew with their formidable logistical acumen and clear intent to both protest and have fun at the same time . These two camps have no cross over what-so-ever as far as I can see . Sitting cheerfully in the middle is the G8 Alternatives / socialist / radical grouping . This middle group certainly has the advantage of wanting to talk and discuss with the more Christian / NGO elements of the demonstrations , but I ca n ' t help feel it 's often in a very sterile and unimaginative way . Having taken a random sample of paper sellers its pretty clear the left found the new ' white bloc ' impenetrable and often were irritated by a perceived blandness . A few self deluded souls aside it was clear that the old style revolutionary literature was not ' selling like hot cakes ' - part of the question is , is this because the demonstrators were to the right of the anti-war demonstrators or because parts of the left is putting their message across in a tired and stale way that leaves one hungry for less ? The Edinburgh demo itself was scorching hot and enormous . Clearly something between two and three hundred thousand strong . Whilst many went on the march others found queuing for hours in the park just to get on the march less appealing and ' the Meadows ' was thronging all day with those listening to the music on big screens , having fun with various family friendly activities or simply catching up with old friends . Great fan of route marching for justice though I am I thought I 'd do my duty and quiz those remaining in the Meadows on how they thought things were going . There was certainly a real carnival atmosphere and part of the reason for this has been the incredible diversity of the hundreds of thousands of participants . I do n't just mean the obvious political differences , but the cultural breadth of it as well . I think this demo had far more young people on it than even the great two million demo against the war that seems like many years ago - and it 's clear there were a high proportion of families and groups of friends there . Another obvious difference between the mass anti-war demonstration and today is that Saturday's demo was very very white - and I 'm not referring to their shirts . I think part of this is the product of NGO and church involvement that have brought people on mass from the middle of England and also the apparent non-involvement of the Muslim community that made the anti-war movement so inspiring . A few placards ( chosen at random ) "" send my friend to school "" , "" George Bush number one terrorist "" , "" no man is an island "" , "" left to die by G8 con "" , "" dirty aid , dirty water "" and the clear and simple "" fight poverty , not wars . "" It was also nice to see Daily Mirror placards - with their headers torn off . Speaking to people about the relationship between the mass gigs and the demo I got some interesting responses . Dave from Oxford thought that in the media the gigs will have surpassed the demo and that the music was guaranteed press coverage in a way that the G8 ' Alternatives ' were not . However , as a veteran of Prague , Nice and Genoa anti-capitalist protests he still felt that it was the direct action that was the most important part of the anti-G8 protests . However important this mass involvement was ( and he clearly thought it was ) this was not an anti-capitalist mobilisation , but a demo for a "" nicer world "" with anti-capitalists in it , as a radical rump . We chatted about whether this G8 was more like previous mobilisations Genoa or Birmingham . It feels like the size and emotion was at the level of Genoa but the predominant ideas were often that of the NGO dominated Birmingham mobilisation . Matthew from Leeds thought this underplayed the diversity of the Genoa protests , because although they were explicitly anti-capitalist there were still pacifist , white handed , Christians there , who ironically took some of the worst of the beatings from the police . Martin from London pointed out the lack of trade union banners , but , in all fairness , as I wondered the crowd I later came across a gorgeous block of trade union banners and placards and the sectioning off was more of a sign of rigid and determined organisation of a very large demonstration than lack of union support . I hunted out some paper sellers of various left organisations who were , on the whole , fairly candid and said that whilst they 'd sold lots of merchandise they were having difficulty selling their papers . One seller saying "" the Christians are impenetrable . "" This was clearly not a traditional hard left protest . Speaking to Karen and Lindsey from Zimbabwe they asked "" where are the African voices here ? "" and felt that Africa probably did n't even know about the G8 and their protests were taking place . But they also seemed to reflect some of the tabloid worries about African corruption and felt that any benefits the G8 should bestow had to be tied to advances of democracy against dictatorship . I really pressed them on this because it seemed unrealistic to me to say unless you 're nicer to your people we will let them starve . But they were pretty clear , no debt relief et al without attacking corruption . Later in the day George Monbiot ( star of the Stop the War rally in my view ) addressed this point really well when he said that "" It 's the Western multinationals that are the biggest bribe givers in the world - who are they to lecture anyone on corruption ? "" There was another clear worry on the part of the protesters - that of being used by the G8 and the demonstration being seen to be owned by Brown , Geldof and co. Jo from Inverness went so far as to say that she should have been marching separately to make it clear she wanted to abolish the G8 , not simply appeal for it to have a cuddly side . Nan , Jo's vociferous yet jovial friend , said that although "" folk sometimes need a spokesman "" they "" forget we have all have a mind "" and even people who are seen to be leading the movement need to listen and respect the opinions of this broad mass . This point was also picked up on at the Stop the War rally when John Rees quite rightly proclaimed that we should never let anyone "" use a mass movement for their own purposes "" and I could n ' t agree more with John on this ( cough ) . David and Lorna , from ' the north ' ( of England ) put it well when I asked if they 'd come to demonstrate for or against the G8 . "" We think the G8 should just get off the backs of the poor . That 's what we think , but I 'm not sure everyone here agrees . "" It was also clear they were pulled by two different arguments . Whilst on the one hand they felt that many of the NGO style protests seem politically bland and they were very keen to say that it 's the corporations that are one of the prime creators of injustice in the poorest parts of the world . They were frustrated that the mainstream acceptance of the campaign had also diluted the message far too far - simultaneously they believed that Geldof had made "" this all possible "" . Now in terms of numbers I actually believe it 's the descendents of Jubilee 2000 that mobilised the bulk of demonstrators on Saturday but it 's certainly true that Geldof has helped create what Monbiot described as "" the false consensus "" that we are all on the same side . That 's why brilliant African activist Trevor Ngwane had his invitation to speak at the Make Poverty History rally withdrawn because his message of opposition to privatisation and neo-liberalism was "" too radical "" . But if we 're not going to address the conditions of structural adjustment that further impoverish the impoverished and create massive human catastrophes then are n ' t we just saying "" let 's throw a few coppers in the charity bowl to make ourselves feel better rather because it 's too radical to actually make a difference . "" John , from Edinburgh Unison was also very clear . It 's true that the voices of Africa had been virtually ignored in the debate on what should happen there but it 's also true that the people of the West have to take responsibility and do what they can to make the world a better place - "" we ca n ' t simply leave the fight up to them [ Africans ] , because the same problems of workers' rights and privatisation come from here "" and although we ca n ' t end the problems ( unlike the implication of the Live8 memento stalls labelled "" the final push "" we have to try . The separation of the radical and mainstream elements of the demonstrations also led to a split in the way the more radical participants reacted to the whole affair . Some began to see themselves as the ' real ' protesters accompanied by far more politically backward elements - others developed a kind of frantic self delusional style trying to convince themselves that the entire thing was in support of their own views of the world . I found both these solutions wholly unattractive , although thankfully not everyone feel into these polarised camps . The Stop the War rally on Saturday saw a whole string of shrieking speakers barking at the rather small crowd ( estimates between 500 and 2,000 ) which felt very small because of the size of the earlier demo . Speaker after speaker referred to how ' we ' had made this all possible ( which ' we ' they did n't say ) and the how the war was central to it all , or who poured hatred and scorn upon Make Poverty History for its insipid message of collaboration with the enemy . The fantastic antidote to this was George Monbiot who not only had something to say of interest but actually spoke to the crowd rather than shouting at them . And , incidentally , on the question of the war , there were a large number of "" George Bush World's # 1 terrorist "" placards both on Saturday and on the Sunday anti-war demo which I ca n ' t help feeling is the wrong message for the left to send out . I liked the occasional "" fight poverty not wars "" placards that I saw which genuinely drew the issues together , but to tell tens of thousands of people who want to do something about global injustice that actually the only real issue is the war on terror I fear is to try to pull people away from making those connections and saying something that we hear every day , even in the mainstream press . Just a little niggle really . Anyway , having tried to record fairly faithfully a flavour of the conversations I had with the actual participants on the demo as an antidote to the rewriting of history that will inevitably take place , I 'll give the last word to Diane and David , the two demonstrators standing right at the back . "" The whole idea is to end poverty , but these are all interlinked issues , we 've not got much faith in the G8 but I just hope that they 've watching and listening . "" </doc>

1093,A14,"Reading : The Cultural Evolution of Neolithic Europe . EUROEVOL Dataset 2 : Zooarchaeological Data Data papers The Cultural Evolution of Neolithic Europe . EUROEVOL Dataset 2 : Zooarchaeological Data Author : Katie Manning University of Oxford , GB About Katie My research centres on the human response to climatic change and the evolution of dietary specialization in the context of Neolithic Europe and Africa . I am the co-editor of ' African Pottery Roulettes Past and Present : Techniques , Identification and Distribution ' and ' The Origins and Spread of Domestic Animals in Southwest Asia and Europe ' Abstract The datasets described in this paper comprises the animal bone data collected as part of the Cultural Evolution of Neolithic Europe project ( EUROEVOL ) , led by Professor Stephen Shennan , UCL , representing the largest collection of animal bone data for the European Neolithic ( Figure 1 ) with > 3 million NISP counts and > 36 , 000 biometric measurements . This is one of three datasets resulting from the EUROEVOL project ; the other two comprising the core spatial and temporal structure of the project , including all radiocarbon dates ( EUROEVOL Dataset 1 ) and archaeobotanical data ( EUROEVOL Dataset 3 ) - http://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/1469811/.

DOI : http://doi.org/10.5334/joad.41 ( 1 ) Overview Context This dataset was collected in the scope of the EUROEVOL project , representing the largest repository of faunal data from Neolithic Europe at the time of publishing . The time frame of the Neolithic in this part of the world broadly encompasses 8000 – 4000 BP , and is characterised by the spread of domestic plants and animals from the Near East alongside the development of novel ceramic and lithic technologies via two routes of dispersal ; a more maritime one , linking the Levant with the Aegean coast of Turkey and Greece into the western Mediterranean , and a more continental one linking central and northwest Anatolia with the more eastern part of Bulgaria and into continental central Europe [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 ] . This spread of early agro-pastoral lifeways also correlates with fundamental changes in past human demography , ecology and social organization [ 5 , 6 ] . Figure 1 Map of northwestern Europe showing sample locations . The aim of the EUROEVOL project was to explain the patterns of stability and change associated with the spread and establishment of farming in Neolithic Europe in the light of new perspectives on human cultures and societies derived from evolutionary theory . The project focused on the western half of temperate Europe , where the available data are best . The project's most important conclusion is that the introduction of farming to Europe did not lead to a steady population increase , but was characterised by a pattern of ' boom ' and ' bust ' in many regions [ 6 , 7 ] . We did not find evidence that these could be accounted for by climate change alone , suggesting that it was internal factors in these early societies that led to them exceeding the sustainable limits of their socio-economic systems . In keeping with this , we found correlations between the population patterns and changing economic patterns [ 8 ] , as well as with investment in conspicuous monument construction and in the incidence of evidence for violence , which appears to be associated with societies exceeding their limits . We have also shown that the cultural transmission processes that produce distinctive patterns of similarity and difference in the archaeological record have recognisable signatures that can be identified from the archaeological material [ 9 , 10 , 11 ] . In addition , we have assessed the relationship between different dating approaches for the European Neolithic and demonstrated the underlying shape of the intensity of European Neolithic cultures through time [ 12 ] . Spatial coverage Central and northwest Europe Description : Poland , Germany , Austria , Switzerland , France , Czech republic , Denmark , Sweden , Belgium , Liechtenstein , Luxembourg , Netherlands and Britain and Ireland . Northern boundary : + 64 . 622N Southern boundary : + 42 . 618N Eastern boundary : + 23 . 963E Western boundary : – 10 . 457E Temporal coverage 8000 BP – 4000 BP Whilst the majority of data falls within this time range , some sites may have associated radiocarbon data that exceeds these boundaries . ( 2 ) Methods The majority of data in this dataset was obtained directly from source publications , as well as Masters theses , PhD theses and occasional unpublished reports . There are five main components of the faunal data , including the NISP counts of all taxa found , summary age data , summary sex data , instances of pathology and biometric data . The dataset utilises the same recording system as the archaeobotanical [ 14 ] and radiocarbon [ 13 ] datasets , as evidenced in the full published MySQL database found at http://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/1469811/. The MySQL dump file , which contains the full relational database for the EUROEVOL project can be downloaded and opened in any SQL interface , or alternatively , imported into MS Access . Steps The data collection process involved three primary approaches : 1 ) contacting specialists in the field of archaeozoology to request specific site reports and publications ; 2 ) Accessing libraries across the UK to access site monographs and journal articles ; 3 ) visiting regional museums and university departments across Europe to access published and unpublished reports on faunal data from site excavations . Once a report had been obtained , both a hardcopy and digital copy were made and these are kept on file at the Institute of Archaeology , UCL . Where necessary reports were translated , often using Google translate and other online translation programmes . Any additional data from the site e.g. stratigraphic information , radiocarbon dates etc. were also archived with the faunal report . If the site did not already exist in our database , its precise location was identified and recorded in decimal degrees . The site was then assigned a unique SiteID and details of the excavation and sampling strategy were recorded . An excel spreadsheet was made for each site , with the different faunal data components being assigned a separate worksheet , including all raw data relating to NISP , sex ratios , age trends , biometrics , pathologies and body part representation . At this stage of the data collection , the original format of the report was maintained . For example , if the analyst had recorded all bones at the context level , this information was retained in the excel spreadsheet . For the sake of consistency in the database all taxa were recorded as a seven-character code ( TaxonCode ) denoting genus ( the first four characters ) and species ( the first three characters ) affiliations . Once all the raw data had been copied , it was then aggregated at the level of the cultural unit , for example LBK , Michelsberg , Cerny , Chasséen etc. Each cultural unit was assigned a unique PhaseCode and these aggregated datasets were then recorded in the database . All faunal data could therefore be identified at either the site level ( based on SiteID ) , or at the phase level ( based on PhaseCode ) , and linked to other associated datasets , for example radiocarbon dates and archaeobotanical data . Each of the faunal tables are published alongside the associated spatial and temporal datasets and archaeobotanical data at [ 13 ] & [ 14 ] . Quality Control We have adopted a fully inclusive approach to the data collection , including all faunal data , irrespective of the date of publication or original analyst . The only exclusion criteria at the data input stage relates to the biometrics . Due to variation in the measuring protocol of different analysts , we have only included measurements that follow the von den Driesch [ 15 ] standard . This provides the largest possible sample size of broadly comparable biometrics . Similarly , the raw counts of demographic data e.g. age and sex consisted of several different quantification techniques . Hence , we have summarised this information in the database , recording simply the age / sex trend e.g. ' majority male ' , majority female ' etc. Additional comments on the demographic trends are recorded in the relative notes fields . All records have been checked to ensure that they are standardised wherever possible . For example , synonym species names , such as Pagophilus groenlandicus and Phoca groenlandica have been recorded under a single taxonomic name to avoid duplication , in this instance Phoca groenlandica . Constraints Occasionally a faunal report lacked any relative counts of the species represented , and simply identified the species present . These have been included in order to permit a presence / absence analysis . Equally some analysts appear to have been more cautious in their identification of wild vs domestic taxa . For example , due to the potential misidentification of Sus scrofa domesticus as Sus scrofa ferus , or vice versa , some analysts chose to record all pig remains as Sus sp . This was equally the case with cattle ( Bos taurus / Bos primigenius ) and horse ( Equus caballus / Equus ferus ) A comparative spatio-temporal analysis of the domestic taxa should therefore work only with phases where the taxa have been recorded to species level . An additional constraint on the species identification was encountered with the sheep ( Ovis aries ) and goat ( Capra hircus ) remains . Due to the difficulties associated with distinguishing between the osteology of sheep and goat [ 16 ] , the majority of ovicaprid remains were originally recorded as Ovis / Capra . It may be advisable therefore to group all sheep / goat remains in future analysis to ensure comparability between sites . Another potential constraint on the data relates to the differential sampling strategies of the original analysts . At sites where sieving was undertaken , there is often a greater representation of fish and bird bone . Any future analyses on these species should therefore take into consideration the sampling strategy , which is noted in the FaunalPhases table .

However , the majority of records , and current MySQL database were created in 2010-2015 . Dataset Creators The primary researcher responsible for the data collection was Katie Manning . Records collected as part of the OSSK project involved Barbara Stopp , and entry of the biometric data was assisted by Eva Fairnell and Rebecca Rennell . Language English License CC0 Repository location The full relational database is available as a SQL dump file and the individual tables ( e . g FaunalPhases , FaunalTaxaList etc. ) are available as . csv files at http://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/1469811/. The SQL dump file can be imported directly into any SQL-based RDMBS , such as MySQL Workbench or Sequel Pro , with all relationships maintained . Alternatively the csv files can be imported into any other RDMBS such as MS Access . Publication date 28 / 07 / 2015 ( 4 ) Reuse potential This dataset comprises the largest single collation of animal bone data for the European Neolithic , and there remains considerable analytical potential for future researchers . The EUROEVOL data is particularly re-usable because the sample sizes are so large ( > 3 million NISP counts and > 36 , 000 biometric measurements ) , permitting robust comparative analysis between sites and regions , and across time . Furthermore , all data is fully georeferenced , offering considerable spatial analytical potential . The data is linked to associated archaeobotanical and radiocarbon data from the same site offering considerable scope for further palaeoecological and palaeoeconomic analyses that incorporate both the plant and animal bone data and in depth temporal analyses . This dataset will prove most useful for archaeozoologists . However , it may also be of benefit to geographers and palaeoecologists interested in past species distribution .

196,A1,"Commission on Sustainable Development acting as the preparatory committee for the World Summit on Sustainable Development Second session 28 January-8 February 2002 Agenda item 1 Adoption of the agenda and organizational matters Letter dated 27 January 2002 from the Permanent Representative of China to the United Nations addressed to the Secretary-General I have the honour to transmit to you herewith the position paper of China : No accreditation of the International Campaign for Tibet to the World Summit on Sustainable Development ( see annex ) . I would be grateful if you could have the present letter and its annex circulated as a document of the Commission on Sustainable Development acting as the preparatory committee for the World Summit on Sustainable Development under agenda item 1 . ( Signed ) Wang Yingfan Ambassador and Permanent Representative of the People's Republic of China to the United Nations Annex to the letter dated 27 January 2002 from the Permanent Representative of China to the United Nations addressed to the Secretary-General China's position paper : No accreditation of the International Campaign for Tibet to the World Summit on Sustainable Development The World Summit on Sustainable Development is an international conference of crucial importance in the field of sustainable development . The Chinese Government attaches great importance to the Summit and has always been actively engaged in the preparatory process for the Summit . The Chinese Government appreciates the active role of non-governmental organizations in the field of sustainable development and welcomes their participation in and contributions to the Summit . However , the International Campaign for Tibet , as listed in the Secretary-General's note on accreditation of non-governmental organizations and other major groups to the World Summit on Sustainable Development ( E / CN . 17 / 2002 / PC . 2 / 16 ) , is an organization whose primary objective is to split Tibet from China . All its main activities have been conducted with a view to achieving this primary objective . Referring to decision 2001 / PC / 3 , adopted at the organizational session of the Commission on Sustainable Development acting as the preparatory committee for the World Summit on Sustainable Development , China firmly opposes granting accreditation to the International Campaign for Tibet to take part in the World Summit on Sustainable Development and its preparatory process . This is a matter of principle to the Chinese Government . Tibet is an inalienable part of China . This is an indisputable fact recognized by all countries in the world . However , the International Campaign for Tibet denies the fact and treats Tibet as an independent State and openly advocates that Tibet is now under "" Chinese invasion "" , "" Chinese occupation "" and even "" Chinese colonial rule "" . Maintaining sovereign territorial integrity is one of the principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations . It is very clear that the objective and splittist activities of the International Campaign for Tibet constitute not only an infringement upon the sovereignty and territorial integrity of China but also a violation of the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations . The International Campaign for Tibet is closely associated with the so-called "" Tibetan government-in-exile "" . The "" Tibetan government-in-exile "" has for a long time devoted itself to splitting Tibet from China and it has never been recognized by any country . Ever since its establishment , the International Campaign for Tibet has been identifying itself with the position and views of the "" Tibetan government-in-exile "" . The main purpose of its activities is to spread and implement policies and schemes formulated by the "" Tibetan government-in-exile "" . The special relationship of the International Campaign for Tibet with the "" Tibetan government-in-exile "" clearly demonstrates its objective of splitting Tibet from China . China is a united multiethnic State . Equality and unity have always been the fundamental principles adopted by the Chinese Government for harmonizing relations among all Chinese ethnic groups . During the second half of the twentieth century , universally acknowledged achievements have been made in political , economic , social and cultural aspects in regions where there are large populations of ethnic minorities , including in Tibet . Out of its objective of splitting Tibet from China , the International Campaign for Tibet has been misleading the international community with all kinds of tricks . The International Campaign for Tibet turns a blind eye to all the achievements made by the Chinese Government . It has organized a series of activities against China and slandered Chinese ethnic policies using distortions and fabrications . It has also tried every means to create obstacles to hinder the economic and social development of Tibet . Moreover , although China has been giving strong and firm support to the international counter-terrorism campaign after the terrorist attacks of 11 September , the International Campaign for Tibet still wantonly makes the accusation that "" China today has established state terrorism "" . This clearly demonstrates its anti-China character . For the above-mentioned reasons , the International Campaign for Tibet should not be allowed to participate , in whatever name and under whatever pretext , in any United Nations activities . Accreditation of such an organization to the World Summit on Sustainable Development will undermine the cooperative atmosphere , normal proceedings and the ultimate success of the Summit . The Chinese Government urges the preparatory committee for the World Summit on Sustainable Development to reject the application of the International Campaign for Tibet for accreditation and calls for the understanding and support of all delegations in this regard . </doc>

65,A4,"THE FALL OF THE HOUSE OF USHER -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Son cœur est un luth suspendu ; Sitôt qu ' on le touche il résonne . De Béranger . During the whole of a dull , dark , and soundless day in the autumn of the year , when the clouds hung oppressively low in the heavens , I had been passing alone , on horseback , through a singularly dreary tract of country ; and at length found myself , as the shades of the evening drew on , within view of the melancholy House of Usher . I know not how it was – but , with the first glimpse of the building , a sense of insufferable gloom pervaded my spirit . I say insufferable ; for the feeling was unrelieved by any of that half-pleasurable , because poetic , sentiment , with which the mind usually receives even the sternest natural images of the desolate or terrible . I looked upon the scene before me – upon the mere house , and the simple landscape features of the domain – upon the bleak walls – upon the vacant eye-like windows – upon a few rank sedges – and upon a few white trunks of decayed trees – with an utter depression of soul which I can compare to no earthly sensation more properly than to the after-dream of the reveler upon opium – the bitter lapse into every-day life – the hideous dropping off of the veil . There was an iciness , a sinking , a sickening of the heart – an unredeemed dreariness of thought which no goading of the imagination could torture into aught of the sublime . What was it – I paused to think – what was it that so unnerved me in the contemplation of the House of Usher ? It was a mystery all insoluble ; nor could I grapple with the shadowy fancies that crowded upon me as I pondered . I was forced to fall back upon the unsatisfactory conclusion that while , beyond doubt , there are combinations of very simple natural objects which have the power of thus affecting us , still the analysis of this power lies among considerations beyond our depth . It was possible , I reflected , that a mere different arrangement of the particulars of the scene , of the details of the picture , would be sufficient to modify , or perhaps to annihilate its capacity for sorrowful impression ; and , acting upon this idea , I reined my horse to the precipitous brink of a black and lurid tarn that lay in unruffled luster by the dwelling , and gazed down – but with a shudder even more thrilling than before – upon the remodeled and inverted images of the gray sedge , and the ghastly tree stems , and the vacant and eye-like windows . Nevertheless , in this mansion of gloom I now proposed to myself a sojourn of some weeks . Its proprietor , Roderick Usher , had been one of my boon companions in boyhood ; but many years had elapsed since our last meeting . A letter , however , had lately reached me in a distant part of the country – a letter from him – which , in its wildly importunate nature , had admitted of no other than a personal reply . The MS . gave evidence of nervous agitation . The writer spoke of acute bodily illness – of a mental disorder which oppressed him , and of an earnest desire to see me , as his best , and indeed his only personal friend , with a view of attempting , by the cheerfulness of my society , some alleviation of his malady . It was the manner in which all this , and much more , was said – it was the apparent heart that went with his request – which allowed me no room for hesitation ; and I accordingly obeyed forthwith what I still considered a very singular summons . Although , as boys , we had been even intimate associates , yet I really knew little of my friend . His reserve had been always excessive and habitual . I was aware , however , that his very ancient family had been noted , time out of mind , for a peculiar sensibility of temperament , displaying itself , through long ages , in many works of exalted art , and manifested , of late , in repeated deeds of munificent , yet unobtrusive charity , as well as in a passionate devotion to the intricacies , perhaps even more than to the orthodox and easily recognizable beauties , of musical science . I had learned , too , the very remarkable fact that the stem of the Usher race , all time-honored as it was , had put forth , at no period , any enduring branch ; in other words , that the entire family lay in the direct line of descent , and had always , with very trifling and very temporary variation , so lain . It was this deficiency , I considered , while running over in thought the perfect keeping of the character of the premises with the accredited character of the people , and while speculating upon the possible influence which the one , in the long lapse of centuries , might have exercised upon the other – it was this deficiency , perhaps , of collateral issue , and the consequent undeviating transmission , from sire to son , of the patrimony with the name , which had , at length , so identified the two as to merge the original title of the estate in the quaint and equivocal appellation of the "" House of Usher "" – an appellation which seemed to include , in the minds of the peasantry who used it , both the family and the family mansion . I have said that the sole effect of my somewhat childish experiment of looking down within the tarn had been to deepen the first singular impression . There can be no doubt that the consciousness of the rapid increase of my superstition – for why should I not so term it ? – served mainly to accelerate the increase itself . Such , I have long known , is the paradoxical law of all sentiments having terror as a basis . And it might have been for this reason only , that , when I again uplifted my eyes to the house itself , from its image in the pool , there grew in my mind a strange fancy – a fancy so ridiculous , indeed , that I but mention it to show the vivid force of the sensations which oppressed me . I had so worked upon my imagination as really to believe that about the whole mansion and domain there hung an atmosphere peculiar to themselves and their immediate vicinity – an atmosphere which had no affinity with the air of heaven , but which had reeked up from the decayed trees , and the gray wall , and the silent tarn – a pestilent and mystic vapor , dull , sluggish , faintly discernible , and leaden-hued . Shaking off from my spirit what must have been a dream , I scanned more narrowly the real aspect of the building . Its principal feature seemed to be that of an excessive antiquity . The discoloration of ages had been great . Minute fungi overspread the whole exterior , hanging in a fine , tangled web-work from the eaves . Yet all this was apart from any extraordinary dilapidation . No portion of the masonry had fallen ; and there appeared to be a wild inconsistency between its still perfect adaptation of parts , and the crumbling condition of the individual stones . In this there was much that reminded me of the specious totality of old woodwork which has rotted for years in some neglected vault , with no disturbance from the breath of the external air . Beyond this indication of extensive decay , however , the fabric gave little token of instability . Perhaps the eye of a scrutinizing observer might have discovered a barely perceptible fissure , which , extending from the roof of the building in front , made its way down the wall in a zigzag direction , until it became lost in the sullen waters of the tarn . Noticing these things , I rode over a short causeway to the house . A servant in waiting took my horse , and I entered the Gothic archway of the hall . A valet , of stealthy step , thence conducted me , in silence , through many dark and intricate passages in my progress to the studio of his master . Much that I encountered on the way contributed , I know not how , to heighten the vague sentiments of which I have already spoken . While the objects around me – while the carvings of the ceilings , the somber tapestries of the walls , the ebon blackness of the floors , and the phantasmagoric armorial trophies which rattled as I strode , were but matters to which , or to such as which , I had been accustomed from my infancy – while I hesitated not to acknowledge how familiar was all this – I still wondered to find how unfamiliar were the fancies which ordinary images were stirring up . On one of the staircases I met the physician of the family . His countenance , I thought , wore a mingled expression of low cunning and perplexity . He accosted me with trepidation and passed on . The valet now threw open a door and ushered me into the presence of his master . The room in which I found myself was very large and lofty . The windows were long , narrow , and pointed , and at so vast a distance from the black oaken floor as to be altogether inaccessible from within . Feeble gleams of encrimsoned light made their way through the trellised panes , and served to render sufficiently distinct the more prominent objects around ; the eye , however , struggled in vain to reach the remoter angles of the chamber , or the recesses of the vaulted and fretted ceiling . Dark draperies hung upon the walls . The general furniture was profuse , comfortless , antique , and tattered . Many books and musical instruments lay scattered about , but failed to give any vitality to the scene . I felt that I breathed an atmosphere of sorrow . An air of stern , deep , and irredeemable gloom hung over and pervaded all . Upon my entrance , Usher arose from a sofa on which he had been lying at full length , and greeted me with a vivacious warmth which had much in it , I at first thought , of an overdone cordiality – of the constrained effort of the ennuyé man of the world . A glance , however , at his countenance convinced me of his perfect sincerity . We sat down ; and for some moments , while he spoke not , I gazed upon him with a feeling half of pity , half of awe . Surely , man had never before so terribly altered , in so brief a period , as had Roderick Usher ! It was with difficulty that I could bring myself to admit the identity of the wan being before me with the companion of my early boyhood . Yet the character of his face had been at all times remarkable . A cadaverousness of complexion ; an eye large , liquid , and luminous beyond comparison ; lips somewhat thin and very pallid , but of a surpassingly beautiful curve ; a nose of a delicate Hebrew model , but with a breadth of nostril unusual in similar formations ; a finely molded chin , speaking , in its want of prominence , of a want of moral energy ; hair of a more than web-like softness and tenuity ; these features , with an inordinate expansion above the regions of the temple , made up altogether a countenance not easily to be forgotten . And now in the mere exaggeration of the prevailing character of these features , and of the expression they were wont to convey , lay so much of change that I doubted to whom I spoke . The now ghastly pallor of the skin , and the now miraculous luster of the eye , above all things startled and even awed me . The silken hair , too , had been suffered to grow all unheeded , and as , in its wild gossamer texture , it floated rather than fell about the face , I could not , even with effort , connect its arabesque expression with any idea of simple humanity . In the manner of my friend I was at once struck with an incoherence – an inconsistency ; and I soon found this to arise from a series of feeble and futile struggles to overcome an habitual trepidancy , an excessive nervous agitation . For something of this nature I had indeed been prepared , no less by his letter than by reminiscences of certain boyish traits , and by conclusions deduced from his peculiar physical conformation and temperament . His action was alternately vivacious and sullen . His voice varied rapidly from a tremulous indecision ( when the animal spirits seemed utterly in abeyance ) to that species of energetic concision – that abrupt , weighty , unhurried , and hollow-sounding enunciation – that leaden , self-balanced , and perfectly modulated guttural utterance , which may be observed in the lost drunkard , or the irreclaimable eater of opium , during the periods of his most intense excitement . It was thus that he spoke of the object of my visit , of his earnest desire to see me , and of the solace he expected me to afford him . He entered , at some length , into what he conceived to be the nature of his malady . It was , he said , a constitutional and a family evil , and one for which he despaired to find a remedy – a mere nervous affection , he immediately added , which would undoubtedly soon pass off . It displayed itself in a host of unnatural sensations . Some of these , as he detailed them , interested and bewildered me ; although , perhaps , the terms and the general manner of the narration had their weight . He suffered much from a morbid acuteness of the senses . The most insipid food was alone endurable ; he could wear only garments of certain texture ; the odors of all flowers were oppressive ; his eyes were tortured by even a faint light ; and there were but peculiar sounds , and these from stringed instruments , which did not inspire him with horror . To an anomalous species of terror I found him a bounden slave . "" I shall perish , "" said he , "" I must perish in this deplorable folly . Thus , thus , and not otherwise , shall I be lost . I dread the events of the future , not in themselves , but in their results . I shudder at the thought of any , even the most trivial , incident , which may operate upon this intolerable agitation of soul . I have , indeed , no abhorrence of danger , except in its absolute effect – in terror . In this unnerved – in this pitiable condition – I feel that the period will sooner or later arrive when I must abandon life and reason together , in some struggle with the grim phantasm , Fear . "" I learned , moreover , at intervals , and through broken and equivocal hints , another singular feature of his mental condition . He was enchained by certain superstitious impressions in regard to the dwelling which he tenanted , and whence , for many years , he had never ventured forth – in regard to an influence whose supposititious force was conveyed in terms too shadowy here to be restated – an influence which some peculiarities in the mere form and substance of his family mansion , had , by dint of long sufferance , he said , obtained over his spirit – an effect which the physique of the gray walls and turrets , and of the dim tarn into which they all looked down , had , at length , brought about upon the morale of his existence . He admitted , however , although with hesitation , that much of the peculiar gloom which thus afflicted him could be traced to a more natural and far more palpable origin – to the severe and long-continued illness – indeed to the evidently approaching dissolution – of a tenderly beloved sister , his sole companion for long years , his last and only relative on earth . "" Her decease , "" he said , with a bitterness which I can never forget , "" would leave him ( him the hopeless and the frail ) the last of the ancient race of the Ushers . "" While he spoke , the lady Madeline ( for so was she called ) passed slowly through a remote portion of the apartment , and , without having noticed my presence , disappeared . I regarded her with an utter astonishment not unmingled with dread ; and yet I found it impossible to account for such feelings . A sensation of stupor oppressed me , as my eyes followed her retreating steps . When a door , at length , closed upon her , my glance sought instinctively and eagerly the countenance of the brother ; but he had buried his face in his hands , and I could only perceive that a far more than ordinary wanness had overspread the emaciated fingers through which trickled many passionate tears . The disease of the lady Madeline had long baffled the skill of her physicians . A settled apathy , a gradual wasting away of the person , and frequent although transient affections of a partially cataleptical character , were the unusual diagnosis . Hitherto she had steadily borne up against the pressure of her malady , and had not betaken herself finally to bed ; but on the closing in of the evening of my arrival at the house , she succumbed ( as her brother told me at night with inexpressible agitation ) to the prostrating power of the destroyer ; and I learned that the glimpse I had obtained of her person would thus probably be the last I should obtain – that the lady , at least while living , would be seen by me no more . For several days ensuing her name was unmentioned by either Usher or myself ; and during this period I was busied in earnest endeavors to alleviate the melancholy of my friend . We painted and read together ; or I listened , as if in a dream , to the wild improvisations of his speaking guitar . And thus , as a closer and still closer intimacy admitted me more unreservedly into the recesses of his spirit , the more bitterly did I perceive the futility of all attempt at cheering a mind from which darkness , as if an inherent positive quality , poured forth upon all objects of the moral and physical universe , in one unceasing radiation of gloom . I shall ever bear about me a memory of the many solemn hours I thus spent alone with the master of the House of Usher . Yet I should fail in any attempt to convey an idea of the exact character of the studies , or of the occupations in which he involved me , or led me the way . An excited and highly distempered ideality threw a sulphurous luster over all . His long , improvised dirges will ring forever in my ears . Among other things , I hold painfully in mind a certain singular perversion and amplification of the wild air of the last waltz of Von Weber . From the paintings over which his elaborate fancy brooded , and which grew , touch by touch , into vaguenesses at which I shuddered the more thrillingly because I shuddered knowing not why , – from these paintings ( vivid as their images now are before me ) I would in vain endeavor to deduce more than a small portion which should lie within the compass of merely written words . By the utter simplicity , by the nakedness of his designs , he arrested and overawed attention . If ever mortal painted an idea , that mortal was Roderick Usher . For me , at least – in the circumstances then surrounding me – there arose out of the pure abstractions which the hypochondriac contrived to throw upon his canvas , an intensity of intolerable awe , no shadow of which felt I ever yet in the contemplation of the certainly glowing yet too concrete reveries of Fuseli . One of the phantasmagoric conceptions of my friend , partaking not so rigidly of the spirit of abstraction , may be shadowed forth , although feebly , in words . A small picture presented the interior of an immensely long and rectangular vault or tunnel , with low walls , smooth , white , and without interruption or device . Certain accessory points of the design served well to convey the idea that this excavation lay at an exceeding depth below the surface of the earth . No outlet was observed in any portion of its vast extent , and no torch or other artificial source of light was discernible ; yet a flood of intense rays rolled throughout , and bathed the whole in a ghastly and inappropriate splendor . I have just spoken of that morbid condition of the auditory nerve which rendered all music intolerable to the sufferer , with the exception of certain effects of stringed instruments . It was , perhaps , the narrow limits to which he thus confined himself upon the guitar , which gave birth , in great measure , to the fantastic character of his performances . But the fervid facility of his impromptus could not be so accounted for . They must have been , and were , in the notes , as well as in the words of his wild fantasias ( for he not unfrequently accompanied himself with rimed verbal improvisations ) , the result of that intense mental collectedness and concentration to which I have previously alluded as observable only in particular moments of the highest artificial excitement . The words of one of these rhapsodies I have easily remembered . I was , perhaps , the more forcibly impressed with it , as he gave it , because , in the under or mystic current of its meaning , I fancied that I perceived , and for the first time , a full consciousness on the part of Usher , of the tottering of his lofty reason upon her throne . The verses , which were entitled "" The Haunted Palace , "" ran very nearly , if not accurately , thus : I. In the greenest of our valleys , By good angels tenanted , Once a fair and stately palace – Radiant palace – reared its head . In the monarch Thought's dominion – It stood there ! Never seraph spread a pinion Over fabric half so fair . II . Banners yellow , glorious , golden , On its roof did float and flow ; ( This – all this – was in the olden Time long ago ) And every gentle air that dallied , In that sweet day , Along the ramparts plumed and pallid , A wingèd odor went away . III . Wanderers in that happy valley Through two luminous windows saw Spirits moving musically To a lute's well-tunèd law , Round about a throne , where sitting ( Porphyrogene ! ) In state his glory well befitting , The ruler of the realm was seen . IV . And all with pearl and ruby glowing Was the fair palace door , Through which came flowing , flowing , flowing And sparkling evermore , A troop of Echoes whose sweet duty Was but to sing , In voices of surpassing beauty , The wit and wisdom of their king . V. But evil things , in robes of sorrow , Assailed the monarch's high estate ( Ah , let us mourn , for never morrow Shall dawn upon him , desolate ! ) ; And , round about his home , the glory That blushed and bloomed Is but a dim-remembered story Of the old time entombed . VI . And travelers now within that valley , Through the red-litten windows , see Vast forms that move fantastically To a discordant melody ; While , like a rapid ghastly river , Through the pale door , A hideous throng rush out forever , And laugh – but smile no more . I well remember that suggestions arising from this ballad led us into a train of thought wherein there became manifest an opinion of Usher's which I mention not so much on account of its novelty ( for other men [ 1 ] have thought thus ) as on account of the pertinacity with which he maintained it . This opinion , in its general form , was that of the sentience of all vegetable things . But , in his disordered fancy , the idea had assumed a more daring character , and trespassed , under certain conditions , upon the kingdom of inorganization . I lack words to express the full extent or the earnest abandon of his persuasion . The belief , however , was connected ( as I have previously hinted ) with the gray stones of the home of his forefathers . The conditions of the sentience had been here , he imagined , fulfilled in the method of collocation of these stones – in the order of their arrangement , as well as in that of the many fungi which overspread them , and of the decayed trees which stood around – above all , in the long-undisturbed endurance of this arrangement , and in its reduplication in the still waters of the tarn . Its evidence – the evidence of the sentience – was to be seen , he said ( and I here started as he spoke ) , in the gradual yet certain condensation of an atmosphere of their own about the waters and the walls . The result was discoverable , he added , in that silent , yet importunate and terrible influence which for centuries had molded the destinies of his family , and which made him what I now saw him – what he was . Such opinions need no comment , and I will make none . Our books – the books which , for years , had formed no small portion of the mental existence of the invalid – were , as might be supposed , in strict keeping with this character of phantasm . We pored together over such works as the Ververt et Chartreuse of Gresset ; the Belphegor of Machiavelli ; the Heaven and Hell of Swedenborg ; the Subterranean Voyage of Nicholas Klimm by Holberg ; the Chiromancy of Robert Flud , of Jean D ' Indaginé , and of De la Chambre ; the Journey into the Blue Distance of Tieck ; and the City of the Sun of Campanella . One favorite volume was a small octavo edition of the Directorium Inquisitorium , by the Dominican Eymeric de Cironne ; and there were passages in Pomponius Mela , about the old African Satyrs and Œgipans , over which Usher would sit dreaming for hours . His chief delight , however , was found in the perusal of an exceedingly rare and curious book in quarto Gothic – the manual of a forgotten church – the Vigiliae Mortuorum secundum Chorum Ecclesiae Maguntinae . I could not help thinking of the wild ritual of this work , and of its probable influence upon the hypochondriac , when , one evening , having informed me abruptly that the lady Madeline was no more , he stated his intention of preserving her corpse for a fortnight ( previously to its final interment ) in one of the numerous vaults within the main walls of the building . The worldly reason , however , assigned for this singular proceeding , was one which I did not feel at liberty to dispute . The brother had been led to his resolution , so he told me , by consideration of the unusual character of the malady of the deceased , of certain obtrusive and eager inquiries on the part of her medical men , and of the remote and exposed situation of the burial ground of the family . I will not deny that when I called to mind the sinister countenance of the person whom I met upon the staircase , on the day of my arrival at the house , I had no desire to oppose what I regarded as at best but a harmless , and by no means an unnatural precaution . At the request of Usher , I personally aided him in the arrangements for the temporary entombment . The body having been encoffined , we two alone bore it to its rest . The vault in which we placed it ( and which had been so long unopened that our torches , half smothered in its oppressive atmosphere , gave us little opportunity for investigation ) was small , damp , and entirely without means of admission for light ; lying , at great depth , immediately beneath that portion of the building in which was my own sleeping apartment . It had been used , apparently , in remote feudal times , for the worst purposes of a donjon-keep , and in later days , as a place of deposit for powder , or some other highly combustible substance , as a portion of its floor , and the whole interior of a long archway through which we reached it , were carefully sheathed with copper . The door , of massive iron , had been also similarly protected . Its immense weight caused an unusually sharp grating sound , as it moved upon its hinges . Having deposited our mournful burden upon tressels within this region of horror , we partially turned aside the yet unscrewed lid of the coffin , and looked upon the face of the tenant . A striking similitude between the brother and sister now first arrested my attention ; and Usher , divining , perhaps , my thoughts , murmured out some few words from which I learned that the deceased and himself had been twins , and that sympathies of a scarcely intelligible nature had always existed between them . Our glances , however , rested not long upon the dead – for we could not regard her unawed . The disease which had thus entombed the lady in the maturity of youth , had left , as usual in all maladies of a strictly cataleptical character , the mockery of a faint blush upon the bosom and the face , and that suspiciously lingering smile upon the lip which is so terrible in death . We replaced and screwed down the lid , and having secured the door of iron , made our way , with toil , into the scarcely less gloomy apartments of the upper portion of the house . And now , some days of bitter grief having elapsed , an observable change came over the features of the mental disorder of my friend . His ordinary manner had vanished . His ordinary occupations were neglected or forgotten . He roamed from chamber to chamber with hurried , unequal , and objectless step . The pallor of his countenance had assumed , if possible , a more ghastly hue – but the luminousness of his eye had utterly gone out . The once occasional huskiness of his tone was heard no more ; and a tremulous quaver , as if of extreme terror , habitually characterized his utterance . There were times , indeed , when I thought his unceasingly agitated mind was laboring with some oppressive secret , to divulge which he struggled for the necessary courage . At times , again , I was obliged to resolve all into the mere inexplicable vagaries of madness ; for I beheld him gazing upon vacancy for long hours , in an attitude of the profoundest attention , as if listening to some imaginary sound . It was no wonder that his condition terrified – that it infected me . I felt creeping upon me , by slow yet certain degrees , the wild influence of his own fantastic yet impressive superstitions . It was , especially , upon retiring to bed late in the night of the seventh or eighth day after the placing of the lady Madeline within the donjon , that I experienced the full power of such feelings . Sleep came not near my couch , while the hours waned and waned away . I struggled to reason off the nervousness which had dominion over me . I endeavored to believe that much , if not all of what I felt , was due to the bewildering influence of the gloomy furniture of the room – of the dark and tattered draperies , which , tortured into motion by the breath of a rising tempest , swayed fitfully to and fro upon the walls , and rustled uneasily about the decorations of the bed . But my efforts were fruitless . An irrepressible tremor gradually pervaded my frame ; and , at length , there sat upon my very heart an incubus of utterly causeless alarm . Shaking this off with a gasp and a struggle , I uplifted myself upon the pillows , and peering earnestly within the intense darkness of the chamber , hearkened – I know not why , except that an instinctive spirit prompted me – to certain low and indefinite sounds which came , through the pauses of the storm , at long intervals , I knew not whence . Overpowered by an intense sentiment of horror , unaccountable yet unendurable , I threw on my clothes with haste ( for I felt that I should sleep no more during the night ) , and endeavored to arouse myself from the pitiable condition into which I had fallen , by pacing rapidly to and fro through the apartment . I had taken but few turns in this manner , when a light step on an adjoining staircase arrested my attention . I presently recognized it as that of Usher . In an instant afterward he rapped , with a gentle touch , at my door , and entered , bearing a lamp . His countenance was , as usual , cadaverously wan – but , moreover , there was a species of mad hilarity in his eyes – and evidently restrained hysteria in his whole demeanor . His air appalled me – but anything was preferable to the solitude which I had so long endured , and I even welcomed his presence as a relief . "" And you have not seen it ? "" he said abruptly , after having stared about him for some moments in silence – "" You have not then seen it ? – but stay ! you shall . "" Thus speaking , and having carefully shaded his lamp , he hurried to one of the casements , and threw it freely open to the storm . The impetuous fury of the entering gust nearly lifted us from our feet . It was , indeed , a tempestuous yet sternly beautiful night , and one wildly singular in its terror and its beauty . A whirlwind had apparently collected its force in our vicinity ; for there were frequent and violent alterations in the direction of the wind ; and the exceeding density of the clouds ( which hung so low as to press upon the turrets of the house ) did not prevent our perceiving the lifelike velocity with which they flew careering from all points against each other , without passing away into the distance . I say that even their exceeding density did not prevent our perceiving this – yet we had no glimpse of the moon or stars – nor was there any flashing forth of the lightning . But the under surfaces of the huge masses of agitated vapor , as well as all terrestrial objects immediately around us , were glowing in the unnatural light of a faintly luminous and distinctly visible gaseous exhalation which hung about and enshrouded the mansion . "" You must not – you shall not behold this ! "" said I , shudderingly , to Usher , as I led him , with a gentle violence , from the window to a seat . "" These appearances , which bewilder you , are merely electrical phenomena not uncommon – or it may be that they have their ghastly origin in the rank miasma of the tarn . Let us close this casement – the air is chilling and dangerous to your frame . Here is one of your favorite romances . I will read and you shall listen ; – and so we will pass away this terrible night together . "" The antique volume which I had taken up was the "" Mad Trist "" of Sir Launcelot Canning ; but I had called it a favorite of Usher's more in sad jest than in earnest ; for , in truth , there is little in its uncouth and unimaginative prolixity which could have had interest for the lofty and spiritual ideality of my friend . It was , however , the only book immediately at hand ; and I indulged a vague hope that the excitement which now agitated the hypochondriac , might find relief ( for the history of mental disorder is full of similar anomalies ) even in the extremeness of the folly which I should read . Could I have judged , indeed , by the wild , overstrained air of vivacity with which he hearkened , or apparently harkened , to the words of the tale , I might well have congratulated myself upon the success of my design . I had arrived at that well-known portion of the story where Ethelred , the hero of the Trist , having sought in vain for peaceable admission into the dwelling of the hermit , proceeds to make good an entrance by force . Here , it will be remembered , the words of the narrative run thus : "" And Ethelred , who was by nature of a doughty heart , and who was now mighty withal , on account of the powerfulness of the wine which he had drunken , waited no longer to hold parley with the hermit , who , in sooth , was of an obstinate and maliceful turn ; but , feeling the rain upon his shoulders , and fearing the rising of the tempest , uplifted his mace outright , and , with blows , made quickly room in the plankings of the door for his gauntleted hand ; and now pulling therewith sturdily , he so cracked , and ripped , and tore all asunder , that the noise of the dry and hollow-sounding wood alarummed and reverberated throughout the forest . "" At the termination of this sentence I started , and for a moment paused ; for it appeared to me ( although I at once concluded that my excited fancy had deceived me ) – it appeared to me that , from some very remote portion of the mansion , there came , indistinctly , to my ears what might have been , in its exact similarity of character , the echo ( but a stifled and dull one certainly ) of the very cracking and ripping sound which Sir Launcelot had so particularly described . It was , beyond doubt , the coincidence alone which had arrested my attention ; for , amid the rattling of the sashes of the casements , and the ordinary commingled noises of the still increasing storm , the sound , in itself , had nothing , surely , which should have interested or disturbed me . I continued the story : "" But the good champion Ethelred , now entering within the door , was sore enraged and amazed to perceive no signal of the maliceful hermit ; but , in the stead thereof , a dragon of a scaly and prodigious demeanor , and of a fiery tongue , which sate in guard before a palace of gold , with a floor of silver ; and upon the wall there hung a shield of shining brass with this legend enwritten – Who entereth herein , a conqueror hath bin ; Who slayeth the dragon , the shield he shall win ; And Ethelred uplifted his mace , and struck upon the head of the dragon , which fell before him , and gave up his pesty breath , with a shriek so horrid and harsh , and withal so piercing , that Ethelred had fain to close his ears with his hands against the dreadful noise of it , the like whereof was never before heard . "" Here again I paused abruptly , and now with a feeling of wild amazement – for there could be no doubt whatever that , in this instance , I did actually hear ( although from what direction it proceeded I found it impossible to say ) a low and apparently distant , but harsh , protracted , and most unusual screaming or grating sound – the exact counterpart of what my fancy had already conjured up for the dragon's unnatural shriek as described by the romancer . Oppressed , as I certainly was , upon the occurrence of this second and most extraordinary coincidence , by a thousand conflicting sensations , in which wonder and extreme terror were predominant , I still retained sufficient presence of mind to avoid exciting , by any observation , the sensitive nervousness of my companion . I was by no means certain that he had noticed the sounds in question ; although , assuredly , a strange alteration had , during the last few minutes , taken place in his demeanor . From a position fronting my own , he had gradually brought round his chair , so as to sit with his face to the door of the chamber ; and thus I could but partially perceive his features , although I saw that his lips trembled as if he were murmuring inaudibly . His head had dropped upon his breast – yet I knew that he was not asleep , from the wide and rigid opening of the eye as I caught a glance of it in profile . The motion of his body , too , was at variance with this idea – for he rocked from side to side with a gentle yet constant and uniform sway . Having rapidly taken notice of all this , I resumed the narrative of Sir Launcelot , which thus proceeded : "" And now the champion , having escaped from the terrible fury of the dragon , bethinking himself of the brazen shield , and of the breaking up of the enchantment which was upon it , removed the carcass from out of the way before him , and approached valorously over the silver pavement of the castle to where the shield was upon the wall ; which in sooth tarried not for his full coming , but fell down at his feet upon the silver floor , with a mighty great and terrible ringing sound . "" No sooner had these syllables passed my lips , than – as if a shield of brass had indeed , at the moment , fallen heavily upon a floor of silver – I became aware of a distinct , hollow , metallic and clangorous , yet apparently muffled reverberation . Completely unnerved , I leaped to my feet ; but the measured rocking movement of Usher was undisturbed . I rushed to the chair in which he sat . His eyes were bent fixedly before him , and throughout his whole countenance there reigned a stony rigidity . But , as I placed my hand upon his shoulder , there came a strong shudder over his whole person ; a sickly smile quivered about his lips ; and I saw that he spoke in a low , hurried , and gibbering murmur , as if unconscious of my presence . Bending closely over him , I at length drank in the hideous import of his words . "" Not hear it ? – yes , I hear it , and have heard it . Long – long – long – many minutes , many hours , many days , have I heard it – yet I dared not – oh , pity me , miserable wretch that I am ! – I dared not – I dared not speak ! We have put her living in the tomb ! Said I not that my senses were acute ? I now tell you that I heard her first feeble movements in the hollow coffin . I heard them – many , many days ago – yet I dared not – I dared not speak ! And now – to-night – Ethelred – ha ! ha ! – the breaking of the hermit's door , and the death-cry of the dragon , and the clangor of the shield ! – say , rather , the rending of her coffin , and the grating of the iron hinges of her prison , and her struggles within the coppered archway of the vault ! Oh , whither shall I fly ? Will she not be here anon ? Is she not hurrying to upbraid me for my haste ? Have I not heard her footstep on the stair ? Do I not distinguish that heavy and horrible beating of her heart ? Madman ! "" – here he sprang furiously to his feet , and shrieked out his syllables , as if in the effort he were giving up his soul – "" Madman ! I tell you that she now stands without the door ! "" As if in the superhuman energy of his utterance there had been found the potency of a spell – the huge antique pannels to which the speaker pointed threw slowly back , upon the instant , their ponderous and ebony jaws . It was the work of the rushing gust – but then without those doors there did stand the lofty and enshrouded figure of the lady Madeline of Usher . There was blood upon her white robes , and the evidence of some bitter struggle upon every portion of her emaciated frame . For a moment she remained trembling and reeling to and fro upon the threshold – then , with a low , moaning cry , fell heavily inward upon the person of her brother , and in her violent and now final death-agonies , bore him to the floor a corpse , and a victim to the terrors he had anticipated . From that chamber , and from that mansion , I fled aghast . The storm was still abroad in all its wrath as I found myself crossing the old causeway . Suddenly there shot along the path a wild light , and I turned to see whence a gleam so unusual could have issued ; for the vast house and its shadows were alone behind me . The radiance was that of the full , setting , and blood-red moon , which now shone vividly through that once barely discernible fissure , of which I have before spoken as extending from the roof of the building , in a zigzag direction , to the base . While I gazed , this fissure rapidly widened – there came a fierce breath of the whirlwind – the entire orb of the satellite burst at once upon my sight – my brain reeled as I saw the mighty walls rushing asunder – there was a long tumultuous shouting sound like the voice of a thousand waters – and the deep and dank tarn at my feet closed sullenly and silently over the fragments of the "" House of Usher .

895,A4,"DES AND MICK GO TRAINSPOTTING AND THEN LOOK FOR THE LOCH NESS MONSTER "" I wonder where Mick is today , "" said Des , who could not find him anywhere . So he went to the local railway station , as you do , to think of where he could possibly be . As it happened , Mick was at the railway station , train spotting . "" Look ! "" said Mick . "" There 's a train . Right , that 's enough of that . "" "" Oh good , "" said Des . "" Let 's go and look for the Loch Ness monster . "" "" At Caterham railway station ? "" said Mick . "" No , stupid ! "" said Des . "" At Loch Ness ! "" "" Silly me , "" sighed Mick sarcastically . "" All right , I 'll come on one condition . That Wayne and Clive and that lot do n't come as well . I want this to be a Greasy-less chapter . "" "" No , "" said Des . "" They 'll probably be there already . "" He went round and checked that no one else was going to Loch Ness . When he confirmed that all were to be staying in the environs of Caterham they drove up to Scotland in Des's Fiat 126 . Three weeks later , when they arrived , Des decided to try out his new Scottish accent . "" Och aye the noo , "" he said in a very South-East England accent . "" That 's very good , "" said Mick sarcastically . "" You 're getting very sarcastic these days , "" said Des . "" No ! I do n't believe you ! Me ? Sarcastic ? "" said Mick , sarcastically . Since it was evening and it was getting rather dark they decided to book into a hotel and then start scanning the loch for any monsters . "" Now just leave this to me , "" said Des as they entered the hotel . He rang the bell and a man in a kilt appeared from behind the reception desk . "" Och aye the noo !! "" he exclaimed in a very Scottish accent . "" Welcome to our wee bonnie hotel . My name is Douglas MacWhitehouse , the hotel manager . How may I help you ? "" Douglas MacWhitehouse seemed rather familiar to Mick . "" Have n't I seen you ... "" Des put his hand over Mick's mouth . "" We 're not going through all that again ! "" he exclaimed . He turned to Douglas . "" Och aye the noo , Mr MacWhitehouse , a very good evening to you . My name is Desmond MacWednesday and this is my wee sassenach companion Mick MacWoolley . "" Mick turned round and tried to pretend he did n't know Des . "" We would like a couple of wee rooms for the night , "" continued Desmond MacWednesday . "" Och aye the noo , that will be most possible , "" said the hotel manager , giving Des and Mick two keys . "" Now would you like a wee bit of food ? The dining room closes in ten minutes . "" "" Och aye the noo , "" said Des . "" That would be most kind . "" "" I 've never been so embarrassed , "" said Mick to Des as they entered the dining room . "" What about that time you mistook the mayor for the dustman ? "" Everyone else in the canteen looked at Mick and sniggered . Mick sighed . "" What 's on the menu then , "" said Des as they sat down . "" Haggis , haggis pie , roast haggis , haggis and chips , haggis and mash , haggis and haggis ... I somehow do n't feel quite so hungry after all , "" said Mick . "" No , neither do I , "" said Des . "" Let 's go to our rooms now and get some sleep . We 've got to be up early tomorrow morning to look for the wee monster . "" Des got up the following morning at 11.55 . Mick had already hired a boat and some monster-detecting equipment . "" Did we have to get up this early ? "" said Des wearily to Mick when they met up . "" There 's a lot of people out here . "" "" I know , everyone wants to look for the monster . "" "" I hope there 's enough room for us , "" said Des . "" Of course ! It 's gihugeous ! "" said Mick . "" Will there be enough time to search the whole loch ? "" asked Des . "" What ?! "" exclaimed Mick . "" That loch is big enough to fit the entire population of the world into it ! And room left over for the monster ! It 'd take years !! "" "" Hey , that 's given me a great idea ! Why do n't we get all the people in the world , then bring them here ... "" "" Des , just shut up and get in the boat , "" said Mick , getting in . "" Come on , get in ! . "" "" Erm , well ... there 's a monster out there you know , could be a bit dangerous . "" "" Are you a man , a mouse or a monster ? "" said Mick . "" Well ... "" said Des . He climbed into the boat and inevitably tipped it up , throwing Mick into the water . "" Aaaarghhhhhhh !!! I ca n't swim !!! "" he yelled . However , he had fallen on something . A monster rose up from the water , with Mick on top it . "" DES !!! DES !!! IT 'S THE MONSTER !!!! HELP !!!! "" yelled Mick . But Des had fainted . A man with a camera then came running up to them . "" You imbecile !! You 've ruined my film !! "" He led the monster to land and Mick slid off . "" It was only a plastic one , "" said Mick , heaving a huge sigh of relief . "" Oh , that 's all right then , "" said Des , immediately regaining consciousness . "" I think we 'll get a bigger boat , "" said Mick , "" and go somewhere else . "" "" And leave me to apologise to that man ! "" said Des . Soon afterwards Des and Mick were back on water in a boat , with Mick rowing and Des scanning the loch . But Des's equipment was not very helpful . "" I 'VE FOUND IT !!! IT 'S THE MONSTER !!! "" yelled Des . "" Oh not again , "" sighed Mick . "" You 're giving me a headache !! "" "" No , this time I 'm sure !! "" exclaimed Des . He peered into the loch and brought out a fish . "" Oh . "" "" That 's the sixty-eighth time ! "" said Mick . "" That thing goes off every time a fish swims past ! "" Des and Mick stayed on the boat for a few more hours and rowed far into the depths of the loch . By dusk Mick was getting worried and Des was getting hungry . "" I think we 've gone too far into the loch , "" said the observant Mick . "" We 're lost . "" "" Why did n't we bring any food ? "" moaned Des . "" We 're surrounded by food , "" said Mick , as the monster-detecting equipment went off yet again . "" Hey Mick , look over there , "" said Des . "" Look at all that bubbling ! It ca n't be a fish !! "" "" And it 's coming towards us !! "" exclaimed Mick . "" The monster 's going to get us !!! "" "" Get rowing !! "" exclaimed Des . Mick started rowing away from the bubbling like never before . "" It 's catching up with us !! "" exclaimed Des . "" Row faster !! "" "" I 'm rowing as fast as I can !! "" exclaimed Mick . "" I could with some help !! "" "" I ca n't look ! "" said Des , closing his eyes . Suddenly something grabbed the back of the boat . Des and Mick gasped . "" Well , it 's been nice knowing you , Mick , "" said Des . "" Erm , Des , look behind you , "" said Mick , who had stopped rowing . Des slowly opened his eyes and turned round . "" Oh , I do n't believe it . "" "" Hello ! "" greeted Wayne Coach , dressed in a wetsuit . "" What are you doing here ?! "" exclaimed Mick . "" Lookin ' for Nessie ! "" exclaimed Wayne . Then Mrs Greasy , Clive Kippers , Farmer Files and several pigs also rose up from under the water dressed in wetsuits . "" Hello ! "" they said in unison . Des and Mick groaned . "" We thought we 'd found it ! "" exclaimed Des . "" Clive looks a bit like a monster , "" said Mick . "" Look at those teeth . "" Clive grinned . "" I 'd rather not , "" said Des . "" Anyway , look , it 's getting dark ! How are we going to get back to land ! I 'm not really seaworthy . I think I 'm going to be sick ... "" "" We 'll give yer a lift ! "" exclaimed Wayne . "" Eh ? "" said Mick , as Des was busy doing what he had to do overboard . They looked as Farmer Files's Land Rover rose up from the water . "" Ooooh arrrrr !!! Oi 've converted i ' in ' o a boat !! "" They climbed into the Land Rover and Files drove them towards land . "" Oh dear , we 've left the boat behind , "" said Des , looking over his shoulder . "" Eh ? "" said Mick , looking behind him . "" I ca n't see it . "" Des looked back - and the boat had vanished . All they could see was a tremendous amount of bubbling , exactly where the boat had been . Des gasped , and fainted . "" Des ! Des ! Are you all right ?! "" said Mick . "" He 's loopy , "" said Clive . "" Leave him . At least now we should have a quiet ride home . "" </doc>

365,A17,"' The scene was about a young man in a club who makes a call to his girlfriend , ' explains Jon . ' I gave John the music and the whole idea inspired him to think of a time when he 'd been in the garage , the phone had gone and a woman had asked him for help , but he was on his way to work and could n ' t do anything . The resulting track is a melancholic folk song about how the wire enables you to say no to human suffering . I like the way that idea randomly flowed and came out of another project ; that 's pretty much the history of Coldcut . ' One path Coldcut have consistently followed is that of dissent . Eloquent and well read , Matt and Jon have always made their opinions heard . Back in 2001 they released ' Re : V olution ' to coincide with the General Election and drove a double decker bus around Westminster ; a commentary on politicians promoting themselves like pop stars . This album 's no different . Topics range from Roots Manuva's criticism of ' plastic Gods ' to Annette Peacock's musings on CCTV surveillance and 21st Century paranoia . Even their new website features a downloadable set of politically satirical Top Trumps cards . Rather than being driven by a revolutionary zeal , though , the pair are happy simply to comment . In fact , Matt is keen to point out that ' hate ' does n ' t even enter his vocabulary . ' I 'm not anti anything . If I do n't like something I just say I ca n ' t love it . We 're pro people . ' ' Turning negative into positive sounds like a hippy thing , ' adds Jon , ' but it 's about engagement and being part of the village community . Communication is important . ' Thankfully that message is evident in the music . Eschewing lofty ideals for damn good tunes , Coldcut have made an album that seeks pleasure rather than conversion . While tracks such as Saul Williams' touching reflections on the diminishing role of manhood are overflowing with sentiment ( ' I ca n ' t play that track without blubbing , ' admits Matt ) , at their core is an energy certain to detonate any dancefloor . ' Activism means taking action and being personally responsible , it does n ' t necessarily mean going around and telling people what they should do , ' comments Matt on Coldcut's reluctance to release a series of didactic polemics . ' I get very frustrated . But I do believe you can cure a lot of these problems with some pragmatic sensibility , ' continues Jon . ' We 're all lazy fuckers , but we 're equally clever and we could design things to sort our shit out if we thought about it beforehand . ' Now fully in theorist swing Matt is on a roll . ' Fela Kuti said music is the weapon of the future , but I would say art is the weapon of now . It is the future . New types of weapons are available if we 're prepared to find new ways of effectively doing battle without reaching for the sub-machine gun . When I hear the word gun I reach for my culture , ' he then adds , cleverly twisting a famous quote by Goering . Green living Like many eco-sensitive artists trying to operate within the record industry , Matt and Jon are constantly called upon to compromise their ethics . From taxi rides necessitated by urgent photo shoots to long haul flights for live shows in Japan , they struggle with a series of daily dilemmas . </doc>

1465,A1,"1 . Arriving Late Customers often have to rearrange their schedule to accommodate a service call . So when a technician is late , customers ( rightly ) get upset . Besides the money they 're paying a technician to perform a job , taking time off work to be home for the call costs money , too . The key is to set realistic expectations on the front end with scheduling . But no matter how well prepared , situations inevitably occur that push a tech behind schedule . When it happens , communicate with the customer . Apologize for the inconvenience and provide an updated arrival time . The "" heads up "" shows customers respect for their time and enables them to adjust their schedule , helping ease the frustration they might feel . 2 . Arriving Unprepared The tech arrives , examines the equipment , but realizes he does n't have the right parts in the truck to fix the problem . What could have been repaired during the initial service call now requires a call-back , costing your company money through lost time , the fuel costs of rolling a second truck , and extended downtime for the customer . "" It 's really hard to always have all the parts you need because you 'd have to haul an entire machine in your vehicle to have all the possible parts , "" Hill says , "" but you can reduce call-backs with better preparation . Get a clear sense of the problem up front so techs can be more likely to bring parts required . If you do n't have the parts in stock , you should have sources that can help expedite parts delivery to reduce the customer's downtime . "" This is where a robust front-end customer service channel is so important . By properly diagnosing the problem early on , during the initial call to customer support , field-service managers can be better assured their techs are heading out into the field with the right information , the right parts , and in the best possible position to get the job done . More advanced systems like parts inventory management programs can help automate this process , too , giving managers a view into what 's on board every tech's truck . Either way , a tech without tools is n't much good to anyone . 3 . Not Following Up So the tech did n't have the right part , and had to schedule a call-back appointment for two days later . But two days later , no one shows up . When the customer calls in to find out where the tech is , the response is , "" Oh yeah , sorry . We 're still waiting on that part to come in . "" Clearly , that 's a no-no . When there are delays or any other type of "" bad news , "" be the first to inform the customer , with an action plan for how your company will remedy the situation . And follow through . This proactive approach will help diffuse the situation before it blows up into a crisis . 4 . Handing Off Customers to a Middleman Hill , who also served as a consultant to 3M for its medical-imaging equipment field service operations for 10 years , describes a challenge the company encountered with its call dispatching processes prior to adjusting its approach . "" At 3M , the customer would call the national dispatch center , who in turn would call the local dispatch center , who would then call the technician , "" he says . "" But so much information [ about the customer's issue ] would get lost . You do n't want too many people in the communication chain because then no one really owns the problem ; no one owns the customer . "" The solution , Hill says , was to assign a primary technician to customer accounts . "" This way , the tech owns the account . If there is a problem , the call goes into the national dispatch , who then contacts the primary tech directly – and we would dispatch that tech whenever possible . "" Especially for big , complicated , or long-standing accounts , having a primary technician who knows the ins and outs of the equipment in question is a smart move . 5 . Ignoring Customer Feedback Without feedback , a company ca n't really know how it 's doing , or how well its technician are performing . Collecting feedback should n't be an option – it should be mandatory . "" At 3M , we had evidence that the techs , if they had a bad service call , would ' accidentally ' forget to leave the [ customer feedback ] card , "" Hill says . "" And even when they left the card , the problem was a low response rate . So , you were n't really getting accurate data – the feedback you need to drive positive change . "" To improve response , 3M trained its "" call takers "" to use their down time every day to call five customers to collect feedback . "" We got a lot of data that way , "" Hill says . "" If the survey scored a 5 out of total of 5 points possible , we would n't do anything . If it was 4 out of 5 , we may have the tech call the customer for additional feedback . If it was 3 out of 5 , we 'd have the service manager call the customer . If it was a 2 or a 1 , we actually had a VP call the customer . So the VPs were hearing really negative information . It turned into a great system for getting the customer's pain to the right place in the organization . "" 6 . Talking Down to Customers Most customers are n't experts in the equipment your company services . But sometimes technicians can take that for granted and get frustrated with customers who "" do n't have a clue . "" Or they go out of their way to make customers feel bad for hiring the last company , who probably "" screwed up the repair . "" Whatever the case , customers resent being talked down to and will take their future business elsewhere , no matter how smart and skilled your tech might be . Train techs to be patient – to take time to walk customers step-by-by through the process , explaining ( in layman's terms ) why a certain procedure or part is necessary to fix the issue . This approach helps build trust with customers , making them more likely to entrust your company with future service opportunities . 7 . Over-Relying on Technology While technologies for customer relationship management ( CRM ) , enterprise resource management ( ERP ) , inventory management , and route-optimization systems are all useful tools for creating operational efficiencies and cost savings , Hill offers this word of caution : "" Do n't look for a technology quick-fix . I 've seen companies do that , where they want some new computer system to solve all their problems , and it ends up being a costly disaster . "" Instead , Hill says , make technology conform to your business . "" Keep in mind , [ field service ] is primarily a people business . So use technology that supports your people in how they work best , as leverage to take service to an even higher level . "" Sites We Like SmartVan </doc>

34,A1,"Acts 1 Jesus Taken Up Into Heaven 1 In my former book , Theophilus , I wrote about all that Jesus began to do and to teach 2 until the day he was taken up to heaven , after giving instructions through the Holy Spirit to the apostles he had chosen . 3 After his suffering , he showed himself to these men and gave many convincing proofs that he was alive . He appeared to them over a period of forty days and spoke about the kingdom of God . 4 On one occasion , while he was eating with them , he gave them this command : "" Do not leave Jerusalem , but wait for the gift my Father promised , which you have heard me speak about . 5 For John baptized with [ a ] water , but in a few days you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit . "" 6 So when they met together , they asked him , "" Lord , are you at this time going to restore the kingdom to Israel ? "" 7 He said to them : "" It is not for you to know the times or dates the Father has set by his own authority . 8 But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes on you ; and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem , and in all Judea and Samaria , and to the ends of the earth . "" 9 After he said this , he was taken up before their very eyes , and a cloud hid him from their sight . 10 They were looking intently up into the sky as he was going , when suddenly two men dressed in white stood beside them . 11 "" Men of Galilee , "" they said , "" why do you stand here looking into the sky ? This same Jesus , who has been taken from you into heaven , will come back in the same way you have seen him go into heaven . "" Matthias Chosen to Replace Judas 12 Then they returned to Jerusalem from the hill called the Mount of Olives , a Sabbath day's walk [ b ] from the city . 13 When they arrived , they went upstairs to the room where they were staying . Those present were Peter , John , James and Andrew ; Philip and Thomas , Bartholomew and Matthew ; James son of Alphaeus and Simon the Zealot , and Judas son of James . 14 They all joined together constantly in prayer , along with the women and Mary the mother of Jesus , and with his brothers . 15 In those days Peter stood up among the believers [ c ] ( a group numbering about a hundred and twenty ) 16 and said , "" Brothers , the Scripture had to be fulfilled which the Holy Spirit spoke long ago through the mouth of David concerning Judas , who served as guide for those who arrested Jesus – 17 he was one of our number and shared in this ministry . "" 18 ( With the reward he got for his wickedness , Judas bought a field ; there he fell headlong , his body burst open and all his intestines spilled out . 19 Everyone in Jerusalem heard about this , so they called that field in their language Akeldama , that is , Field of Blood . ) 20 "" For , "" said Peter , "" it is written in the book of Psalms , "" ' May his place be deserted ; let there be no one to dwell in it , ' [ d ] and , "" ' May another take his place of leadership . ' [ e ] 21 Therefore it is necessary to choose one of the men who have been with us the whole time the Lord Jesus went in and out among us , 22 beginning from John's baptism to the time when Jesus was taken up from us . For one of these must become a witness with us of his resurrection . "" 23 So they proposed two men : Joseph called Barsabbas ( also known as Justus ) and Matthias . 24 Then they prayed , "" Lord , you know everyone's heart . Show us which of these two you have chosen 25 to take over this apostolic ministry , which Judas left to go where he belongs . "" 26 Then they cast lots , and the lot fell to Matthias ; so he was added to the eleven apostles . Acts 2 The Holy Spirit Comes at Pentecost 1 When the day of Pentecost came , they were all together in one place . 2 Suddenly a sound like the blowing of a violent wind came from heaven and filled the whole house where they were sitting . 3 They saw what seemed to be tongues of fire that separated and came to rest on each of them . 4 All of them were filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in other tongues [ a ] as the Spirit enabled them . 5 Now there were staying in Jerusalem God-fearing Jews from every nation under heaven . 6 When they heard this sound , a crowd came together in bewilderment , because each one heard them speaking in his own language . 7 Utterly amazed , they asked : "" Are not all these men who are speaking Galileans ? 8 Then how is it that each of us hears them in his own native language ? 9 Parthians , Medes and Elamites ; residents of Mesopotamia , Judea and Cappadocia , Pontus and Asia , 10 Phrygia and Pamphylia , Egypt and the parts of Libya near Cyrene ; visitors from Rome 11 ( both Jews and converts to Judaism ) ; Cretans and Arabs – we hear them declaring the wonders of God in our own tongues ! "" 12 Amazed and perplexed , they asked one another , "" What does this mean ? "" 13 Some , however , made fun of them and said , "" They have had too much wine . [ b ] "" Peter Addresses the Crowd 14 Then Peter stood up with the Eleven , raised his voice and addressed the crowd : "" Fellow Jews and all of you who live in Jerusalem , let me explain this to you ; listen carefully to what I say . 15 These men are not drunk , as you suppose . It 's only nine in the morning ! 16 No , this is what was spoken by the prophet Joel : 17 "" ' In the last days , God says , I will pour out my Spirit on all people . Your sons and daughters will prophesy , your young men will see visions , your old men will dream dreams . 18 Even on my servants , both men and women , I will pour out my Spirit in those days , and they will prophesy . 19 I will show wonders in the heaven above and signs on the earth below , blood and fire and billows of smoke . 20 The sun will be turned to darkness and the moon to blood before the coming of the great and glorious day of the Lord . 21 And everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved . ' [ c ] 22 "" Men of Israel , listen to this : Jesus of Nazareth was a man accredited by God to you by miracles , wonders and signs , which God did among you through him , as you yourselves know . 23 This man was handed over to you by God's set purpose and foreknowledge ; and you , with the help of wicked men , [ d ] put him to death by nailing him to the cross . 24 But God raised him from the dead , freeing him from the agony of death , because it was impossible for death to keep its hold on him . 25 David said about him : "" ' I saw the Lord always before me . Because he is at my right hand , I will not be shaken . 26 Therefore my heart is glad and my tongue rejoices ; my body also will live in hope , 27 because you will not abandon me to the grave , nor will you let your Holy One see decay . 28 You have made known to me the paths of life ; you will fill me with joy in your presence . ' [ e ] 29 "" Brothers , I can tell you confidently that the patriarch David died and was buried , and his tomb is here to this day . 30 But he was a prophet and knew that God had promised him on oath that he would place one of his descendants on his throne . 31 Seeing what was ahead , he spoke of the resurrection of the Christ , [ f ] that he was not abandoned to the grave , nor did his body see decay . 32 God has raised this Jesus to life , and we are all witnesses of the fact . 33 Exalted to the right hand of God , he has received from the Father the promised Holy Spirit and has poured out what you now see and hear . 34 For David did not ascend to heaven , and yet he said , "" ' The Lord said to my Lord : "" Sit at my right hand 35 until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet . "" ' [ g ] 36 "" Therefore let all Israel be assured of this : God has made this Jesus , whom you crucified , both Lord and Christ . "" 37 When the people heard this , they were cut to the heart and said to Peter and the other apostles , "" Brothers , what shall we do ? "" 38 Peter replied , "" Repent and be baptized , every one of you , in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins . And you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit . 39 The promise is for you and your children and for all who are far off – for all whom the Lord our God will call . "" 40 With many other words he warned them ; and he pleaded with them , "" Save yourselves from this corrupt generation . "" 41 Those who accepted his message were baptized , and about three thousand were added to their number that day . The Fellowship of the Believers 42 They devoted themselves to the apostles' teaching and to the fellowship , to the breaking of bread and to prayer . 43 Everyone was filled with awe , and many wonders and miraculous signs were done by the apostles . 44 All the believers were together and had everything in common . 45 Selling their possessions and goods , they gave to anyone as he had need . 46 Every day they continued to meet together in the temple courts . They broke bread in their homes and ate together with glad and sincere hearts , 47 praising God and enjoying the favor of all the people . And the Lord added to their number daily those who were being saved . </doc>

21,A1,"The China Question President Bush's recent visit to Asia made little news – by design . But that 's because Bush did n't begin to address the issue that is looming ever larger in the region : the changing face of security in Asia in view of China's growing economic and military might . This summer , for example , China and Russia conducted their first-ever grand-scale joint military exercise . This was followed by Russian news reports that China , Russia , and India would conduct trilateral military exercises , named "" Indira 2005 , "" on the same scale before the end of this year . In the past , such a combination of countries was almost unthinkable , and these exercises can not be explained away as simple "" one-off "" affairs with little resonance . Instead , they reflect China's long-term strategic goal of establishing hegemony across Asia . One tool of this ambition is the Shanghai Cooperation Organization ( SCO ) , under which the Sino-Russian exercises took place . Established in June 2001 , the SCO includes China , Russia , Kazakhstan , Kyrgyzstan , Tajikistan , and Uzbekistan . The SCO's original purpose was to mitigate tensions on the borders of China and the Central Asian countries after the collapse of the Soviet Union and the arrival of the United States military with the war in Afghanistan . China regards the SCO as a stage for broadening its influence over a vast region , ranging from the Asia-Pacific to Southwest Asia , the Middle East , East Africa , and the Indian Ocean . Indeed , its members include about 45 % of the world's population , and 28 % of the landmass ranging across the Eurasian continent . China's active leadership of the SCO has resulted in policies that it favors . Gradually , the SCO shifted its focus to fighting Islamic radicals . Nowadays , however , the SCO is often used as a forum to campaign against supposed American unilateralism and to provide a united front – especially between China and Russia – against the US with respect to security and arms-reduction issues in the region . This includes joint anti-terror training and demands to reduce US forces in the region , particularly from Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan . The SCO provides China not only with a platform to confront the existing US-led alliance in the Asia-Pacific region , but is increasingly being used to prevent the formation of a US-led network to restrain China's advance . Ultimately , it is feared that the SCO could develop into a military alliance similar to the Warsaw Pact of the Cold War era , with an embryonic "" Great China Union "" at its core . But China's regional diplomacy goes far beyond the SCO . It seizes every opportunity that comes its way , including the Six Party Talks on North Korea's nuclear ambitions , to emphasize its centrality to the settlement of any and all Asian issues . Moreover , it continues to build its "" string of pearls "" of military bases at every key point on maritime transportation routes along the "" arc of instability "" from the Middle East to China's coast . No one seems to know how to respond to China's diplomatic and military muscle flexing in Asia , for the extent of China's ambitions remains utterly unclear . But , while everyone else ponders China's motives , its government is acting . Indeed , the UK's premier security think tank , the Institute for International Strategic Studies , recently warned that , while the world focuses on the fight against international terrorism and the unfolding events in the Middle East , China is rapidly expanding its influence from Asia to Africa . The "" pearls "" in Africa include Sudan , Angola , Algeria , Gabon , Namibia , Zambia , Tanzania , Zimbabwe , Uganda , Djibouti , Mali , Central Africa , Liberia , Ethiopia , Mozambique , Sierra Leone , and the Democratic Republic of Congo . In each country , China is nurturing special military and commercial relations intended to promote loyalty to Chinese interests . As in Asia , there is a pattern at work : growing Chinese influence begets increased support for Chinese policies . Of course , it 's a two-way street . Whenever complaints come up in the United Nations' Human Rights Committee , China can count on the support of many African countries that have their own human rights problems . Even the selection of Beijing as the site of the 2008 Olympics benefited from "" African votes . "" And China has publicly stated that it will back African nations in potential disputes at the World Trade Organization ( WTO ) and other international organizations . Similarly , many African states now seem to be leaning heavily toward China in its dispute with Taiwan . When Japan's government tried to become a permanent member of the UN Security Council , few African countries backed its bid , despite receiving economic aid for decades . China likes to boast of its "" peaceful rise . "" But the rise of Bismarck's Germany at the end of the nineteenth century was also peaceful – for a while . The question is not whether China rises to great-power status peacefully , but whether it intends to remain peaceful when it gets there . Just as the world confronted the "" German Question "" 125 years ago , it is now confronting the "" China Question . "" We need a better answer this time . </doc>

1563,A1,"Pressroom In the News : Syndicated column asks "" Will new airfare booking system cure headaches – or create more ? "" August 6th , 2013 Nationally-syndicated columnist Chris Elliott dedicated his column to the confusion over IATA's proposed New Distribution Capability ( NDC ) and cited Open Allies as leading the effort to make the proposal more understandable , more collaborative , and more traveler-friendly . Problem is , a large part of the travel industry wants nothing to do with the NDC – and with good reason . The NDC proposal , which is pending approval by the U.S. government , was created without any meaningful input from travel agents and other travel technology companies . If the system is implemented as critics predict it will be , it could actually make airfare shopping harder and force passengers to pay more for their tickets . ... If the NDC is approved , shopping for an inexpensive airfare would be even more difficult than it is today , the group claims . An airline could refuse to show you its cheapest fare unless you register and share information with its site , and even then , it might show you confusing fares that include options such as in-flight wireless and free checked luggage . You might not be able to compare prices between airlines . </doc>

The tenth Homeless World Cup annual football tournament will take place in Mexico City in October 2012 . Ashley Williams & Street Football Wales SFW Patron , Ashley Williams showing his support by donating a signed pair of boots . Street Football Wales - Personal Case studies _ Chris Dowling ... ... ( Known as Dowie ) is 31 years old and has been engaging with the Street Football Wales programme for 4 years . When Dowie first accessed the programme he had been sleeping rough in Swansea for a long time and suffered from a serious alcohol addiction . Dowie 's addiction was such that he was not able to refrain from drinking for any length of time as to do so would have been potentially fatal . However during a Street Football Wales match day Dowie would use alcohol under the supervision of staff in a controlled way in order to keep himself safe . To many this may not have appeared to be any great achievement – however for Dowie it was a valuable contribution to his self realisation that harm reduction was possible . Dowie very rarely missed any league match days and always gave 100 % for his team – The Next Men – showing particular promise as a goal-keeper , despite being blind in one eye . Over time , his skills as a goal keeper developed , as did his self confidence and social skills . Last year , as a result of his alcoholism , Dowie started to suffer from seizures . Despite this , and the fact that he sometimes experienced seizures at a league match day , he continued to play for his team ; Street Football Wales proved to be a safe environment where Dowie could continue to engage in physical activity in spite of all of his challenges , and not be judged negatively by anyone . At the beginning of 2011 , Dowie addressed his alcohol addiction successfully , reducing his intake from daily to occasional . His physical appearance improved dramatically as did his performance in goal for his team . He stated that he felt better than he had for many years . In June 2011 , after managing his alcohol addiction for several months successfully , Dowie was selected to represent Wales at an overseas football tournament . His selection was based on the incredible determination and self development shown by Dowie over four years of engaging with Street Football Wales . In the time between being selected for and participating in the tournament , Dowie suffered devastating bereavement following the deaths of his father and a childhood friend who had been like a brother to him on the streets of Swansea . Through his grief , however , Dowie remained in control of his alcohol addiction – a testament to his hard work and determination in reaching this point in his life . At the football tournament Dowie won ' most improved player ' and ' player of the tournament ' following participation as goalie in 16 matches – 13 of which were won , including keeping 3 clean sheets . Dowie is now living with a family member and is fully focussed and motivated towards building a relationship with his daughter who he has n't seen for many years . He has a new found love of life and is a positive role model to others accessing Street Football Wales , proving that changes can be made regardless of the size of the challenge faced . Johnathan Williams ... _ ... is 22 years old and has been accessing Street Football Wales for 5 years . Johnathan experienced homelessness as a teenager following difficulties at home . He accessed Swansea Young Single Homeless service where he joined the football team that played in the Street Football Wales programme . Johnathan was always keen to do his best both on and off the pitch . Street Football Wales encourages participants to help out at a league match day – including setting up equipment , helping with lunches and clearing up at the end of a day . All are made aware that demonstrating a positive attitude off the pitch is as important as it is when playing football on the pitch and Johnathan took this on board very early on . Unfortunately , Johnathan had a problem with drug use . Street Football Wales league match day's were the only times that he would refrain from smoking drugs for any significant period of time . He would discuss his drug use with volunteers at the programme and expressed a desire to address his issues , taking on board advice and guidance offered . It was , however , very difficult for him to deal with the challenges he faced as he also experienced debilitating bouts of depression linked initially to his childhood experiences and exacerbated by his drug use . Johnathan stated that Street Football Wales match days were the highlight of his month and that when the league closed down during the winter , the Spring re-launch could not come quickly enough for him . Johnathan enjoyed playing football and as his fitness developed he felt confident enough to join a gym in order to further build on this . However , as well as enjoying the football , Johnathan also enjoyed the social aspect of the programme . Having been very badly bullied in school , Jonathan's confidence and self esteem was very low – yet at Street Football Wales match day 's he felt accepted as the programme promotes acceptance and tolerance , which in turn leads to the establishment of support networks and lasting friendships . Johnathan was selected to attend an overseas football tournament for ten days this year and proved to himself that he could live without using drugs . He is currently living with his grandmother , is continuing to address his drug use and is actively seeking employment . </doc>

1124,A17,"Compare These CNET Editors' Rating The Good The LG B6 outperforms every other TV we 've tested , with the exception of even more-expensive 2016 OLED TVs , which perform about the same . It evinced perfect black levels , wide viewing angles , accurate color and a brighter picture than last year . It 's compatible with both types of HDR TV shows and movies , Dolby Vision and HDR10 . Its striking design features a super-slim panel . The Bad It 's still expensive . The Bottom Line LG's high-end 2016 OLED TVs deliver the best picture quality of any TV we 've ever reviewed , and the B6 is the best value of the bunch . Review Sections Fall 2016 update If you were looking for an excuse to buy an OLED TV , here it is . LG has recently dropped the price on its least expensive OLED TV with 4K resolution , the B6 series reviewed here . The 55-inch OLED55B6P is now $ 2 , 000 , while the 65-inch OLED65B6P is $ 3 , 000 . That 's a discount of $ 500 and $ 1 , 000 , respectively , compared to their prices in early October , and although LG says the price reduction is n't permanent , I 'd be surprised if it goes up again before the end of the holidays . I 'd also be surprised if it goes any lower this year . Because of this price drop , and the fact that 2016 OLED TVs like the B6 deliver the best picture quality of any TV I 've ever tested , I 'm increasing its Value subrating from a 6 to a 7 , its overall score from 8.4 ( 4 stars ) to 8.7 ( 4 . 5 stars ) , and awarding it CNET's Editors' Choice Award . In other words , if you have the money and want a 55-inch or 65-inch TV , buy this one . In side-by-side comparisons with LCD TVs I tested , there 's not much of a contest . The B6 , LG's "" cheapest "" 4K OLED TV , simply looks better in almost every way . Its picture is basically the equal of the more expensive E6 I tested at the same time , so I do n't think it 's worth paying extra for that TV's superior sound and styling . It 's also better than the 55EG9100 and the EF9500 , two OLED TVs from last year that are still available , often at slight to steep discounts . The picture quality gap between the B6 and EF9500 is narrow , but wide enough that I do n't advocate buying the older version unless the discount is truly steep . ( The newer B6 and E6 models are fully HDR compatible , unlike those older OLEDs . ) So yes , along with the E6 , the B6 is the best TV I 've ever tested . And yes , many people will think it 's too expensive to buy one , even after the price drop . Extremely good LCD TVs , like the Sony XBR-X930D and the Vizio P series , cost much less , and deliver image quality that 's good enough for just about anyone . But if you 're okay paying a premium for "" the best , "" the LG B6 OLED is the TV to get . And the fact that the premium is up 25 percent less than before just sweetens the deal . Editors' note , November 7 , 2016 : The rating , introduction , headlines and prices in this review ( originally published August 23 , 2016 ) have been updated , but the remainder of the review remains unchanged . Series information : I performed a hands-on evaluation of the 55-inch LG OLED55B6P , but this review also applies to the 65-inch OLED65B6P . Both sizes in the series have identical specifications and according to the manufacturer should provide very similar picture quality . The more expensive OLEDE6P series also received a price drop . I reviewed it at the same time as the B6 . It has very similar picture quality as well , with most of the differences noted below . For that reason the two reviews are very similar . Also receiving the price drop is the curved version of the B6 , the C6 , which has the same specifications and features -- the exception being that the C6 has 3D , while the B6 does not . I prefer flat to curved TVs , but the difference is largely aesthetic . Then there 's the ultra-expensive G6 , with its rotating sound bar stand and available 77-inch size . I did n't test either model , but LG says they all have the same picture quality as the B6 and E6 I did review . Here 's the full lineup , with Amazon pricing current as of November 7 , 2016 . LG 2016 4K OLED TVs Model Size Price Screen shape 3D capable Design OLED55B6P 55 inches $ 2 , 000 Flat No Standard OLED65B6P 65 inches $ 3 , 000 Flat No Standard OLED55C6P 55 inches $ 2 , 000 Curved Yes Standard OLED65C6P 65 inches $ 3 , 000 Curved Yes Standard OLED55E6P 55 inches $ 2 , 800 Flat Yes Picture-on-glass OLED65E6P 65 inches $ 3 , 900 Flat Yes Picture-on-glass OLED65G6P 65 inches $ 8 , 000 Flat Yes Picture-on-glass with sound bar OLED77G6P 77 inches $ 20 , 000 Flat Yes Picture-on-glass with sound bar View full gallery Sarah Tew / CNET There 's thin , then there 's OLED TV thin Plenty of LCD TVs are exceedingly slim in profile these days , but few take it to the level of OLED . The top half of the B6 TV , which consists of just the OLED panel itself and enough structure to support it , is pencil thin , just 0.18 inch deep . The bottom half , where the electronics , power supply , inputs and other stuff live , is thicker at just under two inches . The B6 lacks the striking picture-on-glass design of more expensive 2016 LG OLEDs , but it 's still beautiful TV . It 's nearly all picture from the front , with just a tiny LG logo . The stand is angular and darker shade of silver , and adds a mass of transparent plastic on the back to create a more floaty look . View full gallery Sarah Tew / CNET I 'm guessing most buyers in this price bracket will opt to wall-mount , though , foregoing the stand . Unlike earlier LG OLEDs , which required a special add-on wall bracket , the B6 and other 2016 models can work with a standard VESA wall mount . The remote is basically the same as last year , and I 'm a fan . LG kept its trademark motion control , which allows you to whip around the menus with a responsive cursor rather than a plodding directional keypad . That keypad is still available too , if you want it , along with a slick rubberized scroll wheel . The step-up E6 and G6 TVs enjoy a new , redesigned remote , although it 's not much better than this one . View full gallery Sarah Tew / CNET Smart TV is solid , but not the best There 's nothing wrong with LG's Web OS Smart TV system , and I am glad that response times are snappier than last year throughout the menus , but competing systems ( with the exception of Vizio ) are better . Roku and Android TV have more apps and a better design , and Samsung has the unique ability to control more of your gear . 4K streaming with Dolby Vision HDR is available from Netflix , Amazon and Vudu , which outpaces the HDR selection of Samsung ( which lacks Vudu's HDR ) and Vizio ( which lacks Amazon's ) and matches Sony's . 4K-capable apps include YouTube and Xfinity's lame 4K sampler , formerly exclusive to Samsung , which only works for Comcast subscribers . View full gallery Sarah Tew / CNET Other apps are hit or miss . You get Hulu , Crackle , MLB TV , Plex , Google Play Movies and TV , Spotify and Pandora , for example , but LG's system is missing both HBOs ( Go and Now ) , Showtime ( or Anytime ) , Pluto TV , Sling TV , Watch ESPN , CBS All Access , PBS , PBS Kids and more . Roku and Android TV have all of those , and many more niche apps too , while Samsung's selection is about the same , give or take a few services . ( Note that CNET is a division of CBS . ) You also get voice search and a "" content store "" but none of it is as easy to use , or as comprehensive , as other systems . In the end you 're best off , as usual , getting your streams from an external device . Features and connectivity Key TV features Display technology : OLED LED backlight : N / A Resolution : 4K HDR compatible : HDR10 and Dolby Vision Screen shape : Flat Smart TV : Web OS Remote : Motion 3D capable : No OLED is the dark star of the show here . Its basic tech closer to late , lamented plasma than to the LED LCD ( SUHD or otherwise ) technology used in the vast majority of today's TVs . Where LCD relies on a backlight shining through a liquid crystal panel to create the picture , with OLED and plasma , each individual sub-pixel is responsible for creating illumination . That 's why OLED and plasma are known as "" emissive "" and LED LCD as "" transmissive "" displays , and a big reason why OLED's picture quality is so good . New for 2016 LG is claiming 25 percent higher light output and a wider color gamut compared with previous models like the EF9500 . Interestingly , it also says all of its new 2016 OLED TVs have the same picture quality . See the picture quality section below for tests of those claims . View full gallery Sarah Tew / CNET The other big improvement over last year is support for both types of HDR video : Dolby Vision and HDR10 . Today at least , that means TVs like the B6 can access more HDR TV shows and movies than other devices . On the other hand , the B6 is also the only 2016 4K OLED TV to lack support for 3D sources . If you want a non-curved 2016 OLED with 3D , your cheapest option is the E6 . The only other features difference between the B6 and E6 is the latter's superior sound system . 4x HDMI inputs with HDMI 2 . 0a , HDCP 2.2 3x USB ports 1x component video input 1x composite video input ( shared with component ) Ethernet ( LAN ) port Optical digital audio output RF ( antenna ) input Remote ( RS-232 ) port ( minijack ) The selection of connections is top-notch . Unlike many of Samsung's sets , this one actually has an analog video input for legacy ( non-HDMI ) devices . Picture quality There 's nothing like OLED , and the B6 and E6 are the best OLED TVs I 've tested so far . They improve on the EF9500 from last year with better brightness , wider color gamut and better uniformity in dark areas . They 're not perfect , but they 're better than any LCD TV I 've tested . To be fair , however , my comparison crop did n't include the very best 2016 LCD TVs from Samsung ( the KS9800 ) and Sony ( the Z9D ) , so I ca n't say for sure whether the B6 is better than them . If you 're looking for differences between the two , this review is n't the place to find them . According to my eyes and measurements both were equally adept with the vast majority of stuff I tested . The B6 did have a bit less input lag for gaming , there were slight differences in video processing , and the E6 was a bit brighter , but I ca n't say whether that was the result of their screen size differences . The Vizio M series has a free tablet remote , support for both HDR formats , and excellent ... Vizio's P-Series TV includes a 6-inch Android tablet remote , but what makes it great is ... The cheapest OLED TV is no bargain , but at less than $ 2 , 000 it 's actually affordable for ... If you 're looking to maximize your TV dollar and do n't care about 4K , it 's tough to go ...

318,A7,"6 : Formal Filter In the previous tool kits , I addressed cultural issues and questions of full synonymy . The purpose here is to establish a series of other textual variables for which the ST can be screened . I shall begin with the smallest level at which a decision can be made about the use of language ( the level of sound or letter segments ) and move up to the larger level ( intertextual and generic links between texts ) . The schema of textual filters can be viewed in Section 4 : Schema of Textual Filters Phonic / Graphic Level This is the smallest level of detail or choice in composing texts , and represents choices made at the level of sound segments , phonemes , and letter segments , graphemes . Even at this level difference between meaning can be present ; compare , for example , ' This nosy cook ' , and ' This cosy nook ' . This level is most immediately relevant where sound or visual effects are apparent . Onomatopoeias , words whose sound imitates their meaning , are culturally determined , as may be the range of applications of a particular onomatopoeia in any given language . One example is the case of English ' squeak ' , which gives a single noun to the noises made by doors , mice , and new shoes . In other languages what we perceive as the same group of sounds may be perceived differently , and not all of the nouns used will necessarily be onomatopoeic : It cri cri ( crickets , cicadas , woodworm [ ! ] ) ; Sp chillido ( mouse ) , chirrido ( hinges ) , crujido ( new leather or rice crispies ) ; Fr cric-crac ( floorboards ) , couic ( mouse ) , craquement ( of new leather ) ; grincement ( hinges ) Ge quieken ( mouse ) , knarren ( door , wheel ) . The use of onomatopoeia may be incidental to a ST ; however , if its phonic / graphic level is a salient feature , it may pose a challenge for the translator . On such occasions , the translator may need to consider carefully whether , and how , to compensate for the loss of any salient onomatopoeia , perhaps by compensating with the addition of a sound effect through alliteration and assonance at the appropriate place . However , on occasion appropriate terms in both languages are fully or partially onomatopoeic ; for example , búho ( Spanish ) , Uhu ( German ) , CoBa ( Russian ; transliterated ) , gufo ( Italian ) , and hibon ( French ) are all onomatopoeic names ; however , their English equivalent , ( long-eared ) owl , is only partially so . Assonance ( repetition of vowels for rhyme ; recurrence of sound or letter clusters in the middle of a word ) and alliteration ( repetition of same sound or letter cluster at the beginning of a word ) may also prove a challenge to the translator , as in the alliteration ( bold ) and assonance ( italicised ) of ' a s w ift s n ifter a fter wards ' . Where the use of phonic effects is a salient feature of a ST or its use is not incidental , such as to highlight specific thematic concerns , then a careful approach is necessary . Consider the phonic level in the first two lines of John Keats's ode , ' To Autumn ' 1820 ( full text here ) in which alliteration is in bold , and I have italicized assonance : Season of m ists and m ellow fr uit f ulness , Close boso m - fr iend of the m aturing sun ( from ' To Autumn ' , Keats ) As Hervey and Higgins ( 2002 : 79-80 ) argue , the context is essential . The combination of the title and the word ' fruitfulness ' evokes the colour of mature fruit and autumn leaves , yellow . The sun itself is likely to be such a colour , glowing like a mature fruit hanging low in the sky , and shining through the autumn haze . The m - alliteration of ' mists ' associates it with ' mellow ' and ' maturing ' , and - together with the previous image - it suggests a soft hazy mist rather than the cold and damp of wintertime . The - m in ' bosom ' links it to ' mellow ' , ' mists ' and ' maturing ' so that the image of mellow fruits now seems linked to milk-filled breasts , as if the season , sun and earth were unified in maternal bountifulness . This suggestion is again reinforced through the assonance and alliteration of ' fr uit f ulness ' , and ' fr iend ' . The phonic level here is manipulated to associate closely the key words in Keats's creation of images , and their prominence reinforces the thematic content of the lines and therefore would need careful attention in translation . Be ware that phonic effects are used quite widely by prose writers and are not the sole province of poets . Prosodic Level The prosodic level , on the other hand , is largely the domain of poetry , although metric patterns are very occasionally found in prose . The prosodic level concerns metric schemes relating to rhythm and stress , which vary greatly between languages and language groups . For example , in the modern Romance languages versification is syllabic , that is , based on syllable count , but the method of syllable counting varies between languages . English metre , on the other hand , mainly uses syllable and stress metre . Each line is defined in terms of the number of feet , which comprise a group of stressed and unstressed syllables in a specific order . The most famous English metric pattern is the iambic pentameter : The cur / few tolls / the knell / of par / ting day / 1 2 3 4 5 This line has five feet ( divided by slashes and numbered ) and so is a pentameter . Each foot has two syllables , the first unstressed and the second stressed ( in bold ) , and so is an iambic foot . Some modern English poetry uses strong-stress metre in which only the stresses count when describing the line . For an introduction try James Fenton , An Introduction to English Poetry ( Viking , 2002 ) . Certain fixed forms , like the sonnet and the haiku , enjoy international currency , the form of others varies between languages , such as the ballad , which seems to be a global poetic genre . In most languages which use rhyme , ballads tend to rhyme on even lines only . In English the ballad has four accented syllables in odd lines , and three in even lines . In contrast , syllabic languages tend to use an octosyllabic line . The translation of poetry is particularly controversial , and this debate goes right to the heart of what poetry is really about : creating meaning or exploring form . As a consequence , in translating poetry it is particularly useful to focus on a very specific target audience : the needs of a student of the second-language , someone with an interest in a specific culture , and someone with an interest in poetry as an art form may be very different : Ille mi par esse deo videtur , Ille , si fas est , superare divos , qui sedens adversus identidem te spectat et audit dulce ridentem , misero quod omnis eripit sensus mihi ; He seems to me to be equal to a god , he seems to me , it is lawful , to surpass the gods , who , sitting opposite to you , keeps looking at you and hearing you sweetly laugh ; but this tears away all my senses , wretch that I am . He 'll hie me , par is he ? The God divide her , He 'll hie , see fastest , superior deity , Quiz - sitting adverse identity - mate , inspect it and audit - You 'll care ridden then , misery holds omens , Air rips the senses from me ; Catullus ; trans . Celia & Louis Zukovsky ; apud Hervey , Higgins & Haywood 1996 : 49 The first TT below Catullus's Latin is a literal TT , which is intended to convey the message content . In contrast , the second TT by Zukovsky and Zukovsky attempts a phonemic approach that aims to convey the rhythm and phonic effect of the Latin . The decision to use one of these strategies would need to be based on very careful consideration of the potential target audience for any such TT . There is , of course , a mid-point between these two approaches , and it is perhaps to be advocated in the majority of situations . A communicative approach is one in which the translator pays careful attention to the formal structure of the poem in hand , perhaps taking into account differences in expectations about certain meters or rhyme schemes between source and target culture . The translator also pays careful attention to other salient features of the poem being translated , including other phonic features and content . Consider carefully as many of the versions of the first verse of Lewis Carroll's ' Jabberwocky ' as you can , in which this is precisely the strategy adopted by the translators : Jabberwocky ' Twas brillig , and the slithy toves Did gyre and gimble in the wabe : All mimsy were the borogroves , And the mome raths outgrabe . Der Jammerwoch Es brillig war . Die schlicten Toven Wirrten und wimmelten in Waben ; Und aller-mümsige Burggoven Die mohmen Räth ' ausgraben . Galimatazo Brillaba , brumeando negro , el sol ; agiliscosos giroscaban los limazones banerrando por las váparas lejanas ; mimosos se fruncían los borogobios mientras el momio rantas murgiflaba . Le Jaseroque Il brilgue : los tóves lubricilleux Se gyrent en vrillant dans le guave , Enmimés sont les gougebosqueux , Et le momerade horsgrave . Grammatical Level This concerns arrangements of words ; such as the use of syntax , and word systems ( a pattern of words with an associative , and meaningful , common denominator ) . An example of a meaningful arrangement of words can be found in the Magpie rhyme : One for sorrow , Two for joy , Three for a girl , Four for a boy , Five for silver , Six for gold , Seven for a secret that 's never been told . The pattern is built around a number followed by a preposition . In lines one to six a further pattern is built up around pairs of lines : lines 1 and 2 conclude with a pair of abstract nouns , which are antonyms ; lines 3 and 4 conclude with an indefinite article followed by a pair of common nouns , again also antonyms ; and lines 5 and 6 end with two mass nouns in an ascending series . The final line breaks this pattern in its length , and its structure as it follows the preposition with an indefinite pronoun , an abstract noun , and a relative clause : Number + preposition ( for ) + 2 x abstract antonyms indefinite article + 2 x common nouns / antonyms 2 x mass nouns ascending series indef . article + abstract + relative clause The structure of the rhyme is clearly more important than the message content . For another example of elaborate grammatical arrangement see the quotation below from Tennyson's ' The Ancient Sage ' . Word systems also frequently appear in literary texts . The following example is taken from the novel Count Julian ( Reivindicación del conde don Julián , 1970 ) by Spain's Juan Goytisolo . The author is concerned by the fact that , despite Muslims occupying a large part of what is now modern Spain from the 8th to the 15th centuries , Islamic culture is often held in low esteem in Spain , and the debt of Spanish , and , by extension , European culture to it overlooked . However , there is no need for the reader to have any familiarity with Spanish to observe that there is an obvious word system at work : y galopando con ellos en desenfrenada razzia saquearás los campos de algodón , algarrobo , alfalfa vaciarás aljibes y albercas , demolerás almacenes y dársenas , arruinarás alquerías y fondas , pillarás alcobas , alacenas , zaguanes Lit ST : and galloping with them in a frenzied cavalcade you will destroy the fields of cotton , carob , alfalfa you will empty cisterns and tanks , you will demolish stores and dry docks , you will ruin farmhouses and hostels , you will pillage bedrooms , cupboards , hallways The key to the word system lies in the fact that many of the words in this extract begin with phonetic group al - , a clear indicator of a Spanish word's origins in Arabic . In fact , upon closer examination all of the italicized words have their origins in Arabic either etymologically , culturally or as technologies introduced by the Muslims . The extract lists what will be lost or destroyed if Muslim influence on Hispanic culture were to be eradicated . This passage poses a particular challenge for the translator for a variety of reasons . English lacks the relationship of cultural debt to , but prestige over , Arabic that Goytisolo is attacking , so it is not possible simply to replicate the word system by replacing it with English words of Arabic origin . Many of the languages , such as French or Latin , from which English has borrowed words , phrases or concepts enjoy a relationship of high prestige in relation to English in British culture . Its mother language , Anglosaxon , is infamous for four letter words , and most English-language speakers are unaware of other specific areas of debt . The translator is left with three choices , it seems . The first is to replace the words comprising the word system with concepts drawn from languages of the former colonies , and whose contribution to British culture is not given the prestige they merit . The disadvantage here would be the replacement of specific Hispanic cultural terms derived from Arabic . The second is simply to translate the terms , without comment thereby giving rise to the loss of Goytisolo's point . The third is to use some kind of exegetical technique at some point in order to make explicit the relationship between the two cultures . Sentential Level The Sentential Level treats the sentence as a self-contained vehicle for communication , starting with one word comments , such as ' Go ! ' , or ' Sorry ' . At the sentential level the structure ( or order of parts of speech ) creates different assumptions about the sentence's particular communicative purpose through some of the following features : Intonation or punctuation and typography Clearly in speech the sentential level can be expressed through the manipulation of intonation and stress : The salt ( falling intonation : statement ) ; The salt ? ( rising intonation : question ; fall-rise : emphatic query ) ; The salt ! ( high , level intonation : command ) Whilst written texts lack this feature , they make use of punctuation , which has a much more limited range , to convey some of the purpose of the sentence . Like other features of language , punctuation norms differ between cultures and all translators should be familiar with the differences in punctuation usage between the languages ( and even language varieties , including UK and US English ) that they are translating . There is not space to consider this topic here ; however , most good , advanced grammar books contain a useful section on punctuation . For English , consider reading Lyne Truss's Eats , Shoots and Leaves ( 2003 ) , whose title is based on the famous joke about the gun-totting panda who has correctly interpreted a mispunctuated encyclopaedia entry about its own habits . Written and oral texts make use of a number of other features to convey meaning and purpose at the sentential level : Sequential focus ( marked word order to convey meaning ) I told you to stay at home . You , I told to stay at home . Home - that 's where I told you to stay . In this series , the first sentence uses standard subject + verb + object structure . The second two sentences mark out the focus or theme that is being emphasized by placing it at the beginning of the sentence . Illocutionary particles ( innit ? H ' mmm , do n't you think ? alas ) These short words and phrases do not fit into syntax proper but simply mark the sentence as having a particular communicative purpose , and help guide the reader / listener as to how to take the utterance . They are discrete elements added for affective force not for their literal meaning : French : hélas ; tout de même ; bien : Je t ' avais bien dit de rester chez toi . Italian : non è vero ; ma andiamo ( scoffing disbelief ) ; dunque ( emphatic ) . Spanish : ¿ verdad ? ; ¿ no es cierto ? ; ¿ qué sé yo ? ; pues . German : gell ? ; nich war ? ; aber ; auch ; modal particles , denn ( open and innocuous ) ; ja ( consensus - prevents defensive response ) ; doch mal ( disarming ) : Fahr doch / doch mal selber hin ! Why not go yourself ; Why not pop over yourself . Careful consideration should be given to STs that have features conveying meaning or purpose at the sentential level since they may well require compensation . The Discourse Level This level is concerned with the cohesion and coherence of the ST . Cogency is the degree to which text hangs together ; that is , its thread of intellectual interrelatedness . Cogency is expressed in coherence ( implicit thematic development ) and cohesion ( explicit and transparent linking of sentences through discourse markers and linguistic anaphora ) . The importance of cogency can be illustrated by examining the following text : I was getting hungry . I went downstairs . I knew the kitchen was on the ground floor . I was pretty sure that the kitchen must be on the ground floor . I do n't know why I was certain , but I was . I did n't expect to find the kitchen so easily . I made myself a sandwich . As an account , this narrative is coherent since , although it is not explicitly marked , the events depicted show a tactic but discernible development , and it seems to have an implied chronological structure . However , its limited cohesion is supplied through repetitions . Now consider another version of the same account : I was getting hungry . So I went downstairs . Well ... I knew the kitchen was on the ground floor . I mean , I was pretty sure that it must be there . Actually I do n't know why I was so certain , but I was . Still , I did n't expect to find it so easily . Anyway I made myself a sandwich . Here the account is coherent and cohesive . The cohesion derives from the use of discourse connectors ( in bold at the beginning of some sentences ) to set up links between them . They also act explain or comment on the speakers actions ( all the bold sections ) . In addition , the repetition is replaced by grammatical anaphora ( in italics ) . Anaphora is the replacement of previously used words and phrases by expressions referring back to them : it replaces ' the kitchen ' , and there , ' the ground floor ' . Needless to say , different languages have different degrees of tolerance for the use of anaphora . Languages with gendered noun systems often have sets of appropriate , gendered demonstrative pronouns which are in common use , and whose usage tolerance is higher than for ' it ' and ' them ' in English . Organization at the discourse level may introduce a progression ( similar to that discussed at the sentential level ) of patterns or themes between sentence types : Thou canst not prove the Nameless , O my son , Nor canst thou prove the world thou movest in , Thou canst not prove that thou art body alone , Thou canst not prove that thou art spirit alone , Nor canst thou prove that thou art both in one : Nor canst thou prove that thou art mortal - nay , my son . Thou canst not prove that I who speak with thee , Am not thyself in converse with thyself , For nothing worthy proving can be proven , Nor yet disproven . Wherefore thou be wise , Cleave ever to the sunnier side of doubt , Cling to Faith beyond the forms of Faith ! Tennyson , The Ancient Sage . This extract from Alfred , Lord Tennyson 's The Ancient Sage uses two long sentences , both starting at the beginning of lines with the words , ' Thou canst not prove ... ' ( in bold ) , and using enumeration . There is a marked decrease in length of these two sentences . They are contrasted with the final sentence which Tennyson opens mid-line with the discourse connector , ' Wherefore ... ' ( also in bold ) , which introduces his conclusion . The patterning is used for rhetorical , and climatic effect . Intertextual Level This refers to any meaningful relationship the ST bears to another text ( cultural artefact ) ; such as its genre membership , or imitation , parody or pastiche ; quotation or allusion . For example , individual chapters of David Lodge 's The British Museum is Falling Down pastiche the work of specific authors , whilst in James Joyce's Ulysses they pastiche specific textual genres . Since the intertextual level often contains culturally-specific content , it may require special attention , and some compensation may be called for . For a useful discussion of intertextual techniques , see Peter Hutchinson , Games Authors Play ( London : Methuen , 1983 ) . Some intertextual references enjoy widespread knowledge ; such as the sign above the entrance to Hell in Dante's Inferno : Lasciate ogni speranza , voi ch ' entrate TT1 : Give up all hope , those people who are coming in . TT2 : Abandon all hope , ye who enter here . The translator would need to be making a special point in opting for TT1 , a rather literal rendering of the well known words , and not the more familiar version which appears as TT2 . The translator would , of course , need to be sure that the phrase was actually a quotation or allusion , and - where more than version exists - to decide which to use . Christiane Rochefort's La Porte du fond ( 1988 ; discussed by Hervey & Higgins , 2002 ) offers a particularly interesting illustration of these questions . One section of the book is headed : ' Vous qui entrez ' ( ST1 ) , a structure more common in French than English , and consequently not overly marked . French readers may not , in fact , associate this phrase specifically with Dante . It soon becomes clear , however , that the novel focuses on hellish events : the narrator's sexual abuse by her father . Eventually she tells us that she pinned a notice above her parent's bedroom , Vous qui entrez / Perdez toute esperance ( ST2 ) , and chillingly that her father later said to her , ' perds l ' espérance ma petite ' ( ST3 ) . Suspicions that ST1 is an allusion to Dante are now well founded . The translator is then in a difficult position since it is only the later context that makes this allusion clear . To translate ST1 as ' Ye who enter here ' would reveal the subtext very early on , and the cumulative strength of the allusion would be diminished in comparison with the ST : even ' You who enter ' may give too much away too early . Yet alternative translations , such as ' Those coming in ' lose a vital cohesive element in the thematic structure . There is bound to be loss ; the translator has decide which solution is less unacceptable . 5 : Synonymy | 7 : Semantic Filter Text by Louise M.

7,A1,"Europe's Vital French Connection PARIS – In the debates raging over the future of the European Union and the eurozone , Germany always takes center stage . It has the largest economy , accounting for 28 % of eurozone GDP and 25 % of the eurozone's population . It is running a current-account surplus that is now larger than China's – indeed , the largest in the world in absolute value . And , while weighted majorities can overrule it on some issues , everyone acknowledges that little can be done in the eurozone unless Germany agrees . But the emphasis on Germany , though justified , should not lead to an underestimation of France's critical role . France not only accounts for roughly 22 % of eurozone GDP and 20 % of its population – behind only Germany – but also has the healthiest demography in the eurozone , whereas the German population is projected to decline over the next decade . At the same time , France's critical role reflects more than its size . Indeed , in terms of influencing outcomes in Europe , France is as important as Germany , for three reasons . First , France is an indispensable link between southern and northern Europe at a time of growing economic and financial division between creditors and debtors ( a fissure that has begun to assume a cultural dimension ) . An active France can play a bridging role , leveraging its strong relationship with Germany ( a friendship that is a pillar of the EU ) and its proximity and cultural affinities to the Mediterranean . France is "" southern "" in its current-account deficit , but "" northern "" in its borrowing costs ( slightly above Germany's ) , owing partly to inflows of capital fleeing the south , as well as to modest but positive economic growth . Moreover , there is no perceived "" re-denomination "" risk affecting French assets , given markets' confidence that France will retain the euro . So , while France faces huge economic challenges , its northern and southern features permit it to play a proactive role in the European project's survival . French President François Hollande has already given a rather successful preview of this role , meeting German Chancellor Angela Merkel in Berlin on his first day in office , and , a month later , participating in a high-profile meeting with the Italian and Spanish prime ministers in Rome . Indeed , he took the lead in adding a "" growth pact "" to the "" stability pact "" that had been negotiated under Merkel's leadership . Second , France , under its new center-left government , must demonstrate that the "" European model "" of a market economy coupled with strong social solidarity can be reformed and strengthened , rather than abandoned – not just in Europe's more pragmatic north , but also in its more ideological south . French Socialists will not renounce their traditional commitments ; nor should they . But they now have the opportunity to contribute to the European model's renewal . Under Hollande , France's Socialists favor achieving that renewal through a process of social dialogue that convinces rather than imposes , that focuses both on revenue measures and on boosting government efficiency , and that may adopt some of northern Europe's more successful "" flexicurity "" policies , which combine greater labor-market flexibility with strong social protection . The reforms should also introduce much greater individual choice , permitting solutions to retirement , education , health , and lifestyle issues that can be more easily tailored to citizens' specific circumstances and needs . The government of Hollande and Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault has strong majorities at all executive and legislative levels , giving it a rare opportunity to act . If it can renew the European model at home , it will be able to project that success much more widely , particularly in southern Europe , in turn reinforcing confidence and belief in the EU , particularly among the young generation . The French center-left must lead in conceiving a vision for Europe in which solidarity and equity reinforce long-term economic strength . Finally , along with the United Kingdom among European countries , France retains more of a global role than Germany has yet acquired . While the United Nations Security Council is outdated in its structure , it still plays a crucial legitimizing role ; and France , not Germany , is a member . In many other international organizations as well , France punches above its weight . Similarly , while France exports much less than Germany outside the EU , many large French enterprises rival Germany's in global reach and technical know-how . And French is still a global language . In other words , France not only is a link between Europe's north and south , but also contributes substantially to linking Europe to the rest of the world . Europe needs a renewed vision and effective policies to realize that vision . France's Socialist-Green government can play a critical unifying role as Europeans confront their biggest challenge in decades . Its success will be highly consequential – not least for the political debate that will inform the outcome of Germany's elections in 2013 . </doc>

981,A8,"Scotland to increase checks on home schooling The authorities in Scotland are to trace all children who are being educated at home in order to carry out regular checks that they are receiving a balanced education . It is not known exactly how many children are home educated in the UK but estimates put the figure anywhere between 50,000 and 150,000 . If a child is withdrawn from state education , then local education authorities have a record of the child , but if the child has never attended school then they have no records . Judith Gillespie from the Scottish Parent Teacher Council said that the draft guidelines were designed to bring home education within the system . Speaking on BBC Radio Four's ' You and Yours ' , Ms Gillespie emphasised that the checks were in no way meant to be intrusive . ' It totally recognises the right of parents to educate the children at home , it totally recognises the fact that they do n't have to follow official curriculum , it totally recognises that parents do n't have to have formal teaching qualifications . ' ' What it does say is that all children should be monitored and they should be monitored to make sure that they are receiving a balanced and wide education so that you do n't get somebody who 's only teaching them about one particular topic for example . ' Ms Gillespie admitted that the home educators were ' very angry ' about the checks . Steve Stanford of the group ' Education Otherwise ' who teaches his own children at home has pointed out that the home educators receive no resources from the education system whatsoever and so he believes it is understandable that parents find the checks intrusive . </doc>

934,A4,"A certain man fell ill , and , being in a very bad way , he made a vow that he would sacrifice a hundred oxen to the gods if they would grant him a return to health . Wishing to see how he would keep his vow , they caused him to recover in a short time . Now , he had n't an ox in the world , so he made a hundred little oxen out of tallow and offered them up on an altar , at the same time saying , "" Ye gods , I call you to witness that I have discharged my vow . "" The gods determined to be even with him , so they sent him a dream , in which he was bidden to go to the sea-shore and fetch a hundred crowns which he was to find there .

1106,A16,"He started his career as a businessman establishing weaving mills in Ohain , Lokeren , Tubize , Zele and Ghent . The mills of Tubize , Zele and Ghent would , years later , grow into the Usines Cotonnières de Belgique . From the establishment of the Caisse Générale d ' Épargne et de Retraite in 1865 , he became a member of its management board and became its president in 1889 . In 1869 he was appointed to the discount committee of the NBB , and a year later he became a director . He succeeded Eugène Anspach as vice-governor of the NBB in 1888 and as governor in 1891 . His term as governor of the NBB coincided with an economic revival after the economic depression which had lasted from 1873 until 1895 . Under his leadership the Public Depository as a new department was established at the bank . From now on people could deposit all sorts of valuables or securities , and the bank would take charge of the deposits .

1428,A12,"There are some really great safety features as well . The drive mechanism has a tamper proof cover and removable handle so no unauthorized use occurs . The light head is retrofitted with an electrical contactor that de-energizes the fixture as soon as you start to lower the head so there is no electrical hazard . The device is also equipped with a tension sensing fall brake . If the pole is hit by a vehicle or vandalized , the steel brake activates and keeps the fixture from falling . So now not only have you eliminated the need for an expensive bucket truck , but you do n't need an electrician either . Maintenance personnel can now change the bulb at ground level ! Any property owner is going to be concerned with cost . This is one of the best things about retropole . The national average for traditional light pole maintenance is about $ 250 a year per pole . For example , a property that has 10 pole lights would cost about $ 2500 a year to maintain . With retropole you keep that money , add it to the property's bottom line , and you have just added $ 25000 to the value ( income method ) of the property . The upgrade to retropole does n't cost anywhere near that much . At $ 800 per unit with the purchase of 10 units , that would be a cost of $ 8000 . Thats a net gain of $ 17000 in equity and a 2 year return on investment . More Great Benefits retrople can adapt to most types of poles . Whether your pole be square , round or tapered , retrople can work for you . Since retropole is indeed a retrofit application , your existing light heads need not be changed allowing for original design of parking lot to be maintained . Different finish types on poles can be matched and applied to retropole for a seemingly invisible installation . </doc>

The incident at Rushmoor Fire Station in Hampshire is just one of a number of occasions when emergency vehicles have been delayed by motorists . Fire chiefs are launching a campaign aimed at drivers amid concerns such incidents are on the increase . Photos and videos of obstructing vehicles are being posted as part of the service's # INeedMySpace campaign . Hampshire Fire and Rescue said drivers commonly used its Eastleigh headquarters as a cut-through to avoid traffic lights while others blocked roads and stopped in box junctions outside its fire stations .

Assistant chief officer Andy Bowers said : "" The issue of motorists blocking the paths of emergency services vehicles is worse than ever before .

859,A1,"Can I just say , having been named by Timothy Sherratt , that I am not ' spinning ' the ' invitation to express regret ' into a much firmer command than it is . I would ask that he read Oliver O ' Donovan's very careful remarks on the subject in his posted piece . ECUSA leadership has been asked not to regret that some were hurt , but to regret that the bonds of affection were breached , in other words that they ought not to have done what they did . So far they have not done this and the Primates will not be fooled by some of the fudgy language they are coming up with . I am also very concerned that Timothy Sherratt uses the emotive and inaccurate language about ' shabby treatment of the orthodox ' and ' the Network has been hung out to dry by the Commission ' . I do n't think Drexel Gomes , Bernard Malango , Josiah Fearon and I -- to look no further -- would have signed a document that did that . Neither I nor my colleagues are labelling anyone as cartoon fundamentalists . Many of the USA orthodox are close friends of mine . It is precisely because of that that I am aware how much all kinds of issues get bundled up together in the USA ( as they do here , but the bundles are often different ) , and how that bundling affects all kinds of things in the debate . It was widely noted , for instance , that in the Presidential Election several states managed to get a question about gay marriages into the polling booths at the same time . I do wish the orthodox in the USA would realise that what the Commission was doing , which was all it could do granted the state of play ( would that we had had doctrinal discipline in the Anglican Communion these many decades , but we have to start where we are , not where we are n't ) , was to investigate the ways forward granted that ECUSA and Canada had ignored Lambeth , ACC , Primates and ABC . If that was what we had to investigate , we could not also ignore the fact that invasive episcopal actions are likewise , AT THAT LEVEL not at the level of moral culpability ! , infringements not only of repeated calls from Lambeth and the rest , but of the canons of all four of the great ecumenical councils ( Nicaea , Constantinople , Ephesus , Chalcedon ) . I am very grateful for Ephraim Radner's comments which seem wise and well judged . And I do think that if the dissenting parishes are to have their voices heard , as they must do , they must present -- and I have asked for this information -- a detailed account of what exactly is happening . At the moment I hear a confused noise of people withholding funds , of invading bishops , of parishes and clergy threatened with suspension or deposition , of ECUSA bishops acting against parishes exactly as they do not wish the Anglican Communion to act against them , and so on . If the true picture is to emerge we need the details of who is doing what when and where . The question of how to live with bishops with whom you have major theological disagreements is not new . Anglican evangelicals , to look no further , have been doing it for generations . Only in the very recent past has there emerged this new mood of non-payment of parish contributions and the like . I am well aware of my call to ' hang on ' being open to the charge of unreality . My counter-charge is that I believe we are being called at the moment to a time of painful and patient prayer . The world will not fall in , the Kingdom will not disappear , if orthodox believers in ECUSA and elsewhere hold on to this pain in the presence of God and the power of the Spirit until at least the Primates have said whatever they are going to say in February . I would like this all over and done with too -- believe me , I would , I have other work to attend to ! -- but just because we live in a culture which can drop smart bombs on people at a moment's notice that is no excuse to avoid the gospel call for patience . Meanwhile those of us in a position to do so are , believe me , working literally night and day to find the best way forward for the truth of the gospel and the call to that holiness and integrity of life and witness which alone will confront the principalities and powers with the news that Jesus is Lord . Tom Wright Homosexuality , Scripture and Church 2 [ 536 ] Posted by : Tom Wright Friday 10 February 2006 - 10 : 55pm A key to this is the mistaken belief that the only form of homosexual practice known in the C1 , and hence available for comment by Paul or other early Christians , was the debased relationships associated with paganism . That view , though widespread , needs more detailed refutation than I can provide here , but a quick read through one of the shortest and easiest of Plato s dialogues , The Symposium , indicates that there was just as full a range of homosexual practice available in the ancient world as in the modern , including one-to-one stable , loving partnerships . One might also consider the first-century evidence for homosexual weddings , for instance that of Nero himself ... As for lesbians , one of the remarkable things about Romans 1 is precisely that lesbian behaviour is mentioned first . Like the question of why Elijah is mentioned before Moses in the Markan account of the transfiguration , this one admits of various interpretations , but it can hardly be said that lesbianism goes unmentioned . </doc>

1151,A1,"Puerto Rico walks away from commonwealth . I will not pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the republic for which it stands . This must be the words of thousands of Puerto Ricans living in the island today wishing that their small island would once and for all become free from the colonization of the United States . Puerto Rico has been living under U.S. domination for the past 92 years and it 's considered the last nation in Latin America that is still living in colonization . Puerto Ricans want to be free and should be allowed to be free ; to have the opportunity to vote for the president who sends its young people to war , to have their own currency , to fly one flag in all their schools and finally to feel pride in being an independent nation and not labeled with terms like "" territory "" and "" commonwealth "" . Bigger and more powerful nations that inhabit smaller nations for various benefits should never deny a nation's culture and roots , instead in these modern times people should be allowed to govern themselves and be independent nations . In the midst of the struggle over status ( U.S commonwealth or Independency ) only one clear realization can come of this , Puerto Rico ought to be independent and refuse commonwealth to the United States of America . One of the many benefits citizens from all democratic countries enjoy is the ability to choose their chief in command . As a commonwealth under the United States , Puerto Rican citizens can not vote during the presidential campaign . They are allowed to participate in presidential primaries but not the final event . This is somewhat of an insult to the younger generation on the island being sent off to fight wars representing the U.S. having been denied the privilege to choose the person who is sending them . As an independent nation Puerto Ricans would have the right to participate in elections choosing who their leader would be . The island does have its own elections where they get to choose who will become governor and other various members of the political cabinet but all of these have limited power in deciding the fate of the island . The Governor is allowed to run the island and handle domestic issues but Washington has the final word . This struggle for power has also affected the economy and the ability to export and carry out trades with other nations ; United Sates keeps a tight hold on who the island does business with , ultimately creating a dependent economy . Puerto Rico should be allowed to diversify their sources of capital and their export market something that would strengthen its economy and eliminate the economic dependency that has been created throughout the years . Many in the island believe that independency would allow Puerto Rico to open a broader trading market and as stated by Eric Negron , tax adviser to the independence party , "" as an independent nation Puerto Rico could attract foreign investment and it would at the same time be better able to direct what sort of industries is brought to the island . "" Remaining a commonwealth takes all of these economic privileges away from the people and the government of Puerto Rico who want to see the island's economy soar to a new level . Nations across the world can be proud of their heritage and culture , which makes up their country and it 's the backbone to each individual society . A nation's language is a stamp of their history ; the DNA that makes up its people . Puerto Rico as a commonwealth could be in danger of losing its national language . Spanish has been the island's national language since the Spanish conquistadors first discovered it in 1492 . United Sates wants Puerto Rico to make the change from Spanish to English and demands that both Spanish and English be the national languages ; many schools across the island have already made the transaction and now teach in both languages . Being a Puerto Rican is not being part of an ethnic group or speaking Spanish is not speaking a dialect ; these citizens are people who have their own language and roots and deserve the right to conserve their heritage and most important their culture . However , as a person born in Puerto Rico I have enjoyed many of the benefits that being a commonwealth has provided in my life . One of the most important benefits is the right to American citizenship upon birth . All Puerto Ricans who are born in the island are American citizens and are free to enter the mainland U.S. If Puerto Rico remains a commonwealth this is a benefit that future generations will continue to enjoy . Another benefit the island enjoys is the aid provided by the United States and the tax exemption the island receives ; Puerto Rico is exempt from paying federal taxes . Many supporters of the commonwealth status clearly point out the help the island receives and how life would be if Puerto Rico did not receive the strong financial support from the United Sates and research provided in the CQ Researcher article , Puerto Rico : The Struggle Over Status points out that "" Puerto Rico receives generous tax benefits and more than $ 6 billion a year from the U.S government "" clearly something that the island will not receive if it became independent . All of these benefits the island receives still do not amount to independency and the benefit to govern itself . As an independent nation Puerto Rico would open its trading market with various countries around the world expanding the economy and not having to depend on the help the Unites Sates provides . American citizenship could be obtained through the necessary legal steps and travel between the island and the U.S. will still be available . Receiving the benefits Puerto Rico receives from the United States has helped the island through the years develop into the place it is today but it has come at a costly price with words like "" territory "" and "" commonwealth "" attached to it . No nation should turn its back on their heritage , culture and language at the expense of tax exemptions and financial aid . Instead , Puerto Rico ought to be independent to steer its own course and have the ability to conduct economic trades with other nations , keep Spanish as the main language and have the final word in government issues that affect its people . The Puerto Rican people need to cut the umbilical cord it has created to the United States and stand by their roots , culture and independency . The voice of thousands of Puerto Ricans living in the island need to come forward and make Puerto Rico a free independent nation . </doc>

1380,A16,"The number and diversity of threats within the past decade have created the need to pay closer attention to the safety of our educational institutions . Rampage shootings at Virginia Tech Univ. , Blacksburg , and Northern Illinois Univ. , DeKalb ; explosions from a chemical spill at Georgia Tech Univ. , Atlanta ; a bomb at the Univ. of Oklahoma , Norman ; and the devastation from Hurricanes Katrina and Rita on Gulf Coast campuses , have driven home the vulnerability of our educational institutions . Schools must be ready to enhance campus preparedness for catastrophic events , from weather-related incidents to terrorism . Code compliance Not only are campus officials concerned about protecting their campuses from today's complex threats , but also about complying with new government mandates and codes . Enforced by the Dept. of Education , Washington , universities and colleges must comply with the Clery Act , which requires timely warnings to the campus community about crimes that pose an ongoing threat to students and employees . In addition , the U.S. House of Representatives passed The College Opportunity and Affordability Act of 2008 , which requires colleges and universities to issue public warnings within 30 min . of an emergency . This bill is currently being reviewed by the Senate . Several governing bodies , such as the Dept. of Defense , Washington ; Dept. of Homeland Security , Washington ; and the National Fire Protection Association , Quincy , MA , have already adopted warning-system codes and requirements . Mass Notification Systems , or MNS , are defined as life-safety systems designed to alert and protect people in an emergency . They provide real-time information to people in a building , area , or site through recorded and live voice messages , as well as direction through visual signals . While campus security professionals and administrators struggle with the "" how "" and the "" what "" to communicate , campus facilities' managers and IT administrators focus on how to build the MNS . They study which MNS technologies are available to get the message out , how these technologies can be implemented and integrated with existing infrastructure and communication systems , and where the equipment and systems should be installed . Voice to text According to a report from the Univ. of California Campus Security Task Force , Oakland , CA , released in January 2008 , "" Emergency notification systems should be both layered and redundant-no single means of communication should be solely relied upon to reach the entire campus community . "" From hearing specific voice announcements on campus outdoor loudspeakers , to students receiving emergency text messages on cell phones , school administrators recognize that to effectively communicate in a timely manner , multiple communication solutions should be used , depending on the type of emergency and the campus environment . For example , campus safety experts know that e-mail ca n't reach people on athletic fields , or in classes where professors require students to silence their cell phones . To reach both of these areas , an indoor notification system and an outdoor voice-based warning system would be the most efficient and effective way to alert students or those in the area . According to the Blueprint for Safer Campuses , published by the Int ' l Assn. of Campus Law Enforcement Administrators , West Hartford , CT , communications can consist of the following layers : The MNS should be customized to meet the needs of the individual campus . It should be a modular and scalable system that is easily expanded in phases , by leveraging existing systems . Administrators can build the system one layer at a time , starting with an outdoor system or with an emergency text alerting system , and then add more layers as funds are available . The MNS should allow administrators to alert and inform people in multiple areas , using multiple languages with changing instructions , broadcast to a single floor of a building or to an entire campus , and also to send messages to multiple , geographically separated campuses for regional control . These systems must meet multiple safety industry codes and standards , including the NFPA 72-Annex E , OSHA 1910 . 165-Employee Alarm Systems , the Americans with Disabilities Act , and SAFETY Act Certification , providing legal liability protection for the university in the event of a terrorist attack . Control unit-an integrated base station that transmits emergency announcements as prerecorded or live ( microphone ) messages to any individual or group of audible devices on a campus , as well as sending commands to activate visual-notification appliances . A control unit continuously monitors the status of all radio transceivers and their associated audible and visual notification devices . Web-based emergency communication-text - and voice-messaging systems can alert tens of thousands of students , faculty , and staff . Alerts can be sent simultaneously to multiple devices , including e-mail addresses , cell phones , pagers , and other wireless devices . This dramatically increases the likelihood each student will receive the message , no matter where or when an emergency occurs . Due to possible grid power loss , all MNS components should be protected with battery back up . Other power options , which include solar panels and generators , should be considered to allow alerts to continue without interruption . With a personal alerting system , such as emergency text alerting , the system should be secured with a redundant data center . Campus administrators should be able to remotely activate critical MNS functions from a cell phone or laptop . If the primary command center were destroyed , a fixed or mobile secondary station should be set up to control the system . For improved system management and situation awareness , an MNS should be integrated directly with other command systems , and other life-safety and security systems such as chemical - and intrusion-detection systems and fire-alarm panels . MNS at work Longwood Univ. , Farmville , VA , has nearly 5,000 enrolled students , with 70 % of undergraduates living on campus . With more than 800 full - and part-time faculty , the university has 50 buildings on a 60-acre campus , and 32 off-campus buildings . Longwood Univ. officials relied on emergency contact "" phone trees "" for internal communications , and media outlets for external communications . Students outdoors or off campus could not be notified within seconds of a disaster or power outage . "" The events at Virginia Tech and other schools across the country have demonstrated the necessity to create redundant effective systems that provide information among many pathways , "" said Dan Dillon , Longwood University's emergency-management director . An MNS solution from Cooper Notification , Long Branch , NJ , that includes outdoor warning systems , emergency text messaging , and e-mail alerts , enables officials at Longwood Univ. to alert the campus community in real time , during events such as a tornado or police emergency , and offers protection for the entire campus . The university has installed six WAVES ( wireless audio-visual emergency system ) with HPSAs at highly populated on - and off-campus locations for exterior voice alerting . In an emergency , the HPSAs will broadcast a siren alert , followed by a live or recorded voice message tailored to the situation . The intrusive system has the ability to alert the entire campus or individual areas , depending on the scope of the emergency . In addition , the university has a roam secure alert network ( RSAN ) personal alerting system , also from manufacturer Cooper Notification . Known on campus as Alert Longwood , the system sends emergency text messages to students on their cell phones and e-mail to their university e-mail accounts . Cooper Notification's MNS has been successfully tested in military applications . Additionally , the WAVES outdoor warning system can be integrated into the RSAN platform for a one-system solution . System features include the ability to deliver clear , audible voice alerts to the outdoor population ; to operate on its own network , not relying on the college's infrastructure in the event of a power outage ; and to activate the system quickly and easily . A campus is a growing , evolving community . It is necessary to regularly test and evaluate the MNS , including its subsystems and procedures . The potential for disaster in a college community always exists . But the severity of events-whether natural or manmade-can be curtailed through proper application of a good mass notification system . Authors </doc>

1084,A11,"Smarter Survey Results and Impact : Abandon the Asker-Puker Model ! Today's post comes from a source of deep pain . Analysis Ninjas are valued less than I would prefer for them to be . The post is also sourced from a recent edition of my newsletter , The Marketing – Analytics Intersect . I send it once a week , and it contains my insights and recommendations on those two topics . Like this blog , the newsletter is geared towards being instantly actionable ( rather than just theory-smart , which is pretty cool too ) . Do sign up if you want to deliver a small electric shock of simulation to your brain each week . TMAI # 41 covered a graph that resulted from a survey done by Econsultancy and Lynchpin . I received a ton of responses for it , and great discussion ensued . It prompted me to write this post , essentially an expanded version of TMAI # 41 . I 've added new insights , recommendations , and two bonus lessons on how to do surveys better and a direct challenge to your company's current analytics strategy . If your heart is weak , you can stop reading now . I promise , I wo n't mind one bit . I heart you . If you are open to being challenged ... then here are the short-stories inside this post ... Some of you know that I created the phrases Reporting Squirrels and Analysis Ninjas to emphasize the difference between those that puke data and those that puke insights with actions attached to them . Here is my slide the first time I presented the concept in a keynote ... Cute , right ? : ) While companies , medium and large , often need both roles , I 've massively pushed for every company to want more Analysis Ninjas and for analysts to have careers where they can rapidly undertake metamorphosis from Reporting Squirrels to Analysis Ninjas ( after all the difference in salary is tens of thousands of dollars ) . With that as context , you can imagine how heart-broken I was when Jane shared the following visual from a study done by Econsultancy and Lynchpin . It contains the answers to the question which analytics skills are most in demand ... Checkout the y-axis ... what do you see as the common pattern across them all ? Just data puking . One row after another of data puking skills . Ranked . Almost nothing that quite captures the value of Analysis Ninjas ! N. O. T. H. I. N. G. I did a random Google search and got this list of analytical skills : + Understanding relationships between numbers + Interpreting mathematical information + Visual perception of information + Ability to organize information + Pattern recognition and understanding trends + Argumentation and logical thinking + Ability to create insightful data visualizations + Hypothesis development and design of experimentation + Strategic thinking skills And , that is just a random list ! None of these are in demand ? Look at the list in the graph , what kind of purple squirrel with ant legs and an elephant's nose that nobody needs is Lynchpin describing ? This did not happen at Econsultancy , but the data did cause introspection at my end . And , my first question was the one that is also top of mind of all readers of Occam's Razor ... Is the world so dark that the only "" analytical "" skills that are valued are directly tied to data puking and you should immediately shut down your Analysis Ninja efforts ? Let me share three thoughts for your consideration , then some guidance on how to do surveys right , and end with a call to arms for all of you and the "" data people "" you choose to work with . Three thoughts that explain the Econsultancy / Lynchpin graph . 1 . The survey design is at fault . The otherwise well-respected Econsultancy and Lynchpin dropped the ball massively in creating the list of answers for the respondents to choose from . I have to admit , I believe this is a major flaw ( and not just for this question in the entire report ) . What is disappointing is that they have done this for nine years in a row ! It poses these questions ... How is it that in nine years no one at these organizations realized they were simply asking people to rank data puking answers ? Did the survey list the skills Econsultancy and Lynchpin hire for and value in their own analysts ? The graph illustrates data for three years ... Was the fact that almost nothing changed in three years in terms of priority not trigger a rethink of the options provided for this question ? Anyone reading the report at the two companies creating it should have thrown a red flag up and said hey guys , the respondents keep rating the answers the same , maybe we are not asking the right question or providing the best choices for our respondents to pick . More on how to avoid this flaw in your surveys , of any kind , below . 2 . The survey is targeted to the wrong folks . They might be the wrong folks to accurately judge what analytical skills and how to appreciate the value of each skill as they rank them . That could explain the results ( not the answer choices though ) . Econsultancy / Lynchpin provides this description in the report : "" There were 960 respondents to our research request , which took the form of a global online survey fielded in May and June 2016 . Respondents included both in-house digital professionals and analysts ( 56 % ) and supply-side respondents , including agencies , consultants and vendors ( 44 % ) . "" The survey was 76 % from the UK and EU . Respondents were solicited from each company's database as well as Social Media . Here is the distribution provided in the report : On paper it looks like the departments are to be what you would expect . It is difficult to ascribe any blame to the folks who got the survey . There is a chance that there is a UK and EU nuance here , but I do n't think so . 3 . It is our fault . My first instinct in these cases is to look into the mirror . Perhaps we have not succeeded as much as we should when it comes to show casing the value of true data analysis . Perhaps all the people involved in all digital analytics jobs / initiatives , inside and outside companies , are primarily data pukers , and none of them have skills to teach companies that there is such a thing as data analysis that is better . Then , you and I , and especially our friends in UK and EU , need to work harder to prove to companies that CDPs ( customized data pukes , my name for reporting ) do not add much value , the rain of data does not drive much action . You and I need to truly move to the IABI model were we send very little data , and what little we send out is sent with copious amounts of Insights from the data , what Actions leaders need to take , and the computation of the Business Impact . The more we deliver IABI , by using our copious analytical skills , the more the leaders will start to recognize what real analytical skills are and be able to separate between Reporting Squirrels and Analysis Ninjas . Bottom-line ... I would like to blame the competency at Econsultancy and Lynchpin , especially because I believe that truly , but I must take some responsibility on behalf of the Analysis Ninjas of the world . Perhaps we suck more than we would like to admit . I mean that sincerely . Bonus # 1 : Lessons from Econsultancy / Lynchpin Survey Strategy . There are a small clump of lessons from my practice in collecting qualitative feedback that came to fore in thinking about this particular survey . Let me share those with you , they cover challenges that surely the E + L team faced as they put this initiative together . If your survey has questions that cease to be relevant , should you ask them again for the sale of consistency as you have done this survey for nine years ? There is a huge amount of pressure for repeated surveys to keep the questions the same because Survey Data Providers love to show time trends – month over month , year over year . It might seem silly that you would keep asking a question when you know it is not relevant , but there is pressure . This is even worse when it comes to answer choices . Survey Creators love having stability and being able to show how things have changed , and they keep irrelevant / awful / dead answers around . If you are in this position ... You will be brave , you will be a warrior , you will be the lone against-the-tide-swimmer , and you will slay non-value-added stuff ruthlessly . You will burn for from the ashes shall rise glory . If you are the Big Boss of such an initiative , here is a simple incentive to create , especially for digital-anything surveys : Give your team a standard goal that 30 % of the survey questions for any survey repeated each year have to be eliminated and 10 % new ones added . Your permission will 1 . force your employees to think hard about what to keep and what to kill ( imagine that , thinking ! ) 2 . create a great and fun culture in your analytical ( or reporting : ( ) team and 3 . push them to know of the latest and greatest and include that in the survey . If I feel I have a collection of terrible choices , do you have a strategy for how I can identify that ? This does not work for all questions of course , but here is one of my favourite choice in cases where the questions relate to organizations , people skills , and other such elements . Take this as an example ... How do you know that this is a profoundly sub-optimal collection of choices to provide ? For anyone with even the remotest amount of relevant experience , subject matter expertise , it is easy to see these are crazy choices – essentially implying purple squirrels exist . But , how would you know ? Simple . Start writing down how many different roles are represented in the list . That is just what I did ... It turns out there are at least five roles in a normal company that would possess these skills . So . Is this a good collection of skills to list ? Without that relevant information ? If you still go ahead and ask this question , what are you patterning your audience to look for / understand ? Oh , and I am still not over that in looking for what analysis skills are missing in the company , no actual analytical skills are listed above ! Ok , maybe statistical modeling smells like an analytical skill . But , that 's as close as it gets . I share this simple strategy , identifying the number of different roles this represents , to help you illuminate you might have a sub-optimal collection of choices . There are many other strategies like this one for other question . Look for them ! If your survey respondents are not the ideal audience for a question , what 's your job when crafting the survey ? J. K. I. Just kill it . If you do n't want to kill it ... Personally interview a random sample of 50 people personally ( for a 1,000 people survey ) . Take 10 mins each . Ask primitive basic questions about their job , their actual real work ( not job title ) , and their approximate knowledge . If these 50 pass the sniff test , send the survey . Else , know that your survey stinks . JKI . I know that I am putting an onerous burden on the survey company , taking to 50 people even for 10 mins comes at a cost . It does . I am empathetic to it . Consider it the cost of not putting smelly stuff out into the world . If your survey respondents wo n't be able to answer a question perfectly , what is a great strategy for crafting questions ? Oh , oh , oh , I love this problem . It happens all the time . You as the survey creator do n't know what you are taking about , the audience does not quite know what they are talking about , but there is something you both want to know / say . Here 's the solution : Do n't do drop down answers or radio button answers ! The first couple times you do this , ask open ended questions . What analytical skills do you think you need in your company ? Let them type out in their own words what they want . Then find a relatively smart person with subject matter expertise , give them a good salary and a case of Red Bull , and ask them to categorize . It will be eye opening . The results will improve your understanding and now you 'll have a stronger assessment of what you are playing with , and the audience will not feel boxed in by your choices , instead tell you how they see the answers . ( Maybe , just maybe be , they 'll give you my list of analytical skills above ! ) Then run the survey for a couple years with the choices from above . In year four , go back to the open text strategy . Get new ideas . Get smarter . Rinse . Repeat . I would like to think I know all the answers in the world . Hubris . I use the strategy above to become knowledgeable about the facts on the ground and then use those facts ( on occasion complemented by one or two of my choices ) to run the survey . This rule is great for all kinds of surveys , always start with open-text . It is harder . But that is what being a brave warrior of knowledge is all about ! If your survey results cause your senior executives , or random folks on the web , to question them , what is the best response ? The instinct to close in an be defensive , to even counter-attack , is strong . As I 'm sure your mom's taught you : Resist . Truly listen . Understand the higher order bit . Evolve . Then let your smarter walk do the talking . Simple . Awfully hard to do . Still . Simple . Bonus # 2 : The Askers-Pukers Business Model . The biggest thing a report like Econsultancy / Lynchpin's suffers from is that this group of individuals , perhaps even both these companies , see their role in this initiative as Askers-Pukers . It is defined as : Let us go ask a 960 people we can find amongst our customers and on social media a series of questions , convert that into tables and graphs , and sell it to the world . Ask questions . Puke data . That is all there is in the report . Download the sample report if you do n't have a paid Econsultancy subscription . If you do n't want to use your email address , use this wonderful service : www.throwawaymail.com Even if you set aside the surveying methodology , the questions framing , the answer choices and all else , there is negative value from anything you get from Askers-Pukers , because the totality of the interpretation of the data is writing in text what the graphs / tables already show or extremely generic text . Negative value also because you are giving money for the report that is value-deficient , and you are investing time in reading it to try and figure out something valuable . You lose twice . Instead one would hope that Econsultancy , Lynchpin , the team you interact with from Google , your internal analytics team , any human you interact who has data sees their role as IABI providers ( Insights – Actions – Business Impact ) . This is the process IABI providers follow : Ask questions . Analyze it for why the trends in the data exist ( Insights ) . Identify what a company can / should do based on the why ( Actions ) . Then , have the courage , and the analytical chops , to predict how much the impact will be on the company's business if they do what was recommended . Insights . Actions . Business Impact . Perhaps the fatal flaw in my analysis above , my hope above , is that I expected Econsultancy and Lynchpin to be really good at business strategy , industry knowledge , on the ground understanding of patterns with their massive collection of clients . Hence , knowing what actually works . I expected them to be Analysts . Instead , they perhaps limit their skills inside the respective company to be Askers-Pukers . Both companies are doing extremely well financially , hence I do appreciate that Askers-Pukers model does work . But for you , and for me , and for anyone else you are paying a single cent for when it comes to data – either data reported from a survey , data reported from your digital analytics tool , data reported from other companies you work with like Facebook or Google or GE – demand IABI . Why . What . How Much . If they do n't have that , you are talking to the wrong people . Press the escape button , do n't press the submit order button . [ Is n't it ironic . Econsultancy and Lynchpin did exactly what their survey has shown for nine years is not working for companies in the UK : Reporting . The outcome for both of them is exactly the same as the outcome for the companies : Nothing valuable . This is explicitly demonstrated by their full report . ] Bottom-line . I hope you see that this one survey is not the point . E + L are not the point . What their work in this specific example ( and you should check other examples if you pay either company money ) illuminates is a common problem that is stifling our efforts in the analytics business . This applies to E + L but it applies even more to your internal analytics team , it applies extremely to the consultants you hire , it applies to anyone you are giving a single cent to when it comes to data . Do n't hire Askers-Pukers . Do n't repeat things for years without constantly stress-testing for reality . Do n't make compromises when you do surveys or mine Adobe for data . Do n't create pretty charts without seeing , really looking with your eyes , what is on the chart and thinking about what it really represents . Applied to your own job inside any company , using Google Analytics or Adobe or iPerceptions or Compete or any other tool ... do n't be an Asker-Puker yourself . Be an IABI provider . That is where the money is . That is where the love is . That is where the glory is . Carpe Diem ! As always , it is your turn now . Is your company hiring Reporting Squirrels or Analysis Ninjas ? Why ? Is the work you are doing at your company / agency / consulting entity / survey data provider , truly Analysis Ninja work ? If not , why is it that it remains an Asker-Puker role ? Are there skills you 've developed in your career to shift to the person whose business is why , what , how much ? Lastly , when you do surveys , of the type above or others , are there favourite strategies you deploy to get a stronger signal rather than just strong noise ? Please share your life lessons from the front lines , critique , praise , fun-facts and valuable guidance for me and other readers via comments . Thank you . Merci . Arigato . PS : I hope this post illuminates the valuable content The Marketing – Analytics Intersect shares each week , sign up here . Comments Just this second your newsletter ended up in my inbox and I had to comment on it . Askers-pukers model is really one of the greatest things I 've read recently . I was just in discussion how I hate the skyscraper content method that led to all those "" 10 things you need to .. "" , "" 15 things you need to .. "" , "" 20 things .... "" you know .. and then this came in . Because I hate these "" Empirically looking nonsense reports "" just as much . The best thing is the hidden irony between dealing with Analytic Skills whilst showing not even a hint of it themselves . Asker puked model is interesting .. first time ever heard of it . Kidding . While the name is new , we are surrounded by Analysts and Agencies who practice this model . As they realize that revenue is not in this model for them or their clients hopefully they will take your advice to morph into IABI providers . Avinash – I read this , then read it again . I did n't know whether to laugh or cry . Thank you for not only pointing out some of the weaknesses but also suggesting some positive things to improve matters . These are the real learnings for me . Keep em coming . We have to remember that every generation is being exposed to exponentially more data and the tools to assist in understanding lag . More important we do n't teach this kind of critical thinking to nearly enough people . We are still very early in a huge journey and much like DTP was in the 1980s you can use good tools and produce bad work . It takes time to develop the appreciation of how to make a difference with all this new data . Peter : I concur with you about the speed and quantity of change that is happening . It is a bit crazy . I hope this is taken by vendors , consultants , and internal Analysis Ninjas as a call to arms to invest regularly in self-development . It is so very easy in this industry to become stale . It use to take 20 years , it takes less than 2 now . This is 100 % true . But I was wondering : is it possible that the very structure of businesses cause the phenomenon of data puking ? I mean , assuming that most people are actively seeking promotions , the only way for them to prove their points and to elevate in the hierarchy is to generate reports validating their hypotheses and proving that they were right in the first place . I would suggest that such a bias does not lead to greater insights , but to data pukes , as you described so well . Benoit : Yes , the way modern orgs function they do incentivize lots of data puking . There is a mistaken belief that just access to data is enough to make smarter decisions . No , what you are describing as requirement for promotions is analysis , and analysis is good . Sadly , though most of the time people just get loads of data , due to lack of skills or training they are unable to convert that data into analysis which results in fewer promotions . I continue to be amazed at your ability to identify structural gaps in thinking from just one slide . One element that might be unique to you is that you get outraged when you see bad things , while most people rarely are passionate enough to give it a second glance . That is a lesson I 'll take with me from your post . Continue to point out these issues and push the industry forward . You wrote a lot to make a simple point . The survey was extremely poorly done with little thought to the audience and topic being measured . Tracking surveys makes sense when the kpi 's being measured are in fact consistent ( e.g. , brand awareness ) . The Researchers failed to recognize the skills of an ' analyst ' are not consistent over time or universal across industries and geography . But the point that people need to think crtically about what analysts do or should do within their organization is well taken . On survey strategies , there have been many a good book written on the subject of ( marketing ) research surveys that hardly need a rehash here . Avinash , thanks for the article . I think business is evolving . I think organizations are at the beginning of the journey on how to use the data they emit . I appreciate the inspiration . Thanks for putting your thoughts and feedback into the public domain – I could definitely feel my ears privately burning on the edge of the Marketing – Analytics Intersect last week ! We do put our Lynchpin name to this survey – by way of sponsorship rather than overall authorship I should emphasise – which makes us absolutely open to challenge by association . For the avoidance of doubt ( and rumour of unloved / unwanted weird squirrel / elephant / ant hybrids occupying Lynchpin towers ) I definitely agree that companies should seek out analysts with fundamental traits around numeracy , pattern recognition , communication , commercial awareness , hypothesis development , strategic thinking and so on . In blunt terms , I think the idea of your world view being substantially different to that presented in the survey report and / or the industry reality is perhaps overstated . You cite IABA as the model to aspire to ( "" Be an IABI provider . That is where the money is . That is where the love is . That is where the glory is . "" ) . I 'm certainly not disagreeing with that aspiration , but I 'd simply call IABA as you describe it "" good reporting "" . OK , really good reporting , fantastically tailored to the audience in terms of granularity and context and so on . But still , ultimately , the end product is : a report . So I can agree that bad reports = data puking and good reports = insight puking . Maybe less puking would be good overall . But I 'm not sure the reporting squirrel ( "" loser "" ? ) / analytics ninja ( "" winner "" ? ) differentiation is always a helpful reference point from an organisational perspective or a career development plan . We had an interesting panel discussion when the survey was first published ( with people that run internal analytics teams for large companies on the panel , not a bunch of consultants ) , and a lot of the discussion focused around how information is communicated around the organisation and carefully managing the interactions with stakeholders involved to drive success . I appreciate stakeholder management is a fairly corporate / bullshit term , but it 's far from "" data puking "" and increasingly what I hear VP's ( or UK equivalent ) seeking in their analytics teams . I like your "" sniff test "" analogy . I promise you those phrases in the offensive graphs would not be in the survey if we were n't hearing them consistently from people that hold budgets describing what they think they need from their analytics functions . You rightly classify them into multiple roles . We were deliberately looking to show the breadth of expectation set upon "" analytics teams "" and "" analyst roles "" by businesses ( please fix the TMS , please present to the board , please predict our sales for next year , please tell us something useful / interesting about our customers , please help us understand what our objectives are ) rather than suggesting a one person frankenstein monster exists . That said , 3 years ago statistical modelling was the least recognised skill-gap . Now it is the most recognised . I think that 's perhaps still relevant as a trend for budding squirrels on this exciting intersection to understand . There is a lot more in your comment and you have absolutely carried me with you with other things you mention . I am deeply grateful for the food for thought you 've provided . I 'll humbly push back on the idea that IABI is reporting . It is not . Reporting it producing a report or a chart – a clever one , a pretty one , a necessary one ( in most modern corporations , there is no escape from reporting ) . My definition of insights , and the thing that my students are learning at Market Motive and the thing that my large team at my employer uses , is why the thing that you see in the chart / table happened . A mix of deep dive analysis and business analysis . My definition of actions are the things that a client should do . A mix of business strategy and competitive analysis . The output is words in English ( or Urdu or Hebrew or Mandarin ) . My definition of business impact is how much a brand or performance KPI will move if aforementioned action is accomplished . The output is one number , mentioned next to each line of English / Urdu . 75 % of the above is not reporting , neither will it come from your Google Analytics account , your Micro-Strategy BI tool account etc. etc. It comes from a human's ability to dig and understand business strategy and relationships with Sr. Leaders . I think of that as output of analysis : IABI . No reporting I have ever seen has ever had the three elements above . At it 's very best , as you also saw in the Econsultancy report , "" really good reporting "" repeats in text what the report ( CDP ) shows . I hope I can carry you with me in the difference between reporting and analysis . Hi Avinash , I am really happy that you wrote a post about this issue . You are a true crusader . we owe you a lot . One confession to make – I get all your new posts through email . Basically , I do n't read the whole post at that time . I come back later when I have some quite time . For my visit to not considered as bounced , I just click on any link before leaving the site : ) . I know 1 visit with bounce is n't going to change anything but I just do n't want to disappoint you . I really feel bad and week for doing this . But I also think that It is my love and respect to you and all the hard work you put into Occam's Razor that I ca n't possibly disappoint you . And one more thing , waiting very patiently for your next book "" Web analytics 3.0 "" . Bhola : You are kind , but you should not worry about Bounce Rate for this blog . I use the strategy I recommend everyone follow ... I only measure Bounce Rate for New Visitors . For Returning , I know that most will read the latest post , and that is ok ! I do love it when they share their experience via comments , it helps everyone . So , thank you . In fact you should not be worried about bounce rate for new visitors too . Your articles are so thought-provoking , and also lengthy , that often users would take time to read and digest it . Maybe you should just look at conversion of new visitors into returning , and ensure that the "" tl ; dr "" audience is less . This reflects what I see in the marketplace . Businesses want outcomes but hire staff based on outputs . Econsultancy's list looks like an employment posting , just a long list of outputs . As long as the squirrels are managed by people that know the outcomes they 're after , is there a problem ? Greg : This is a real problem , as in it is real and it is a problem ! Part of the responsibility falls on the current leadership at companies ( in pretty much any country ) that do not truly value digital , and in turn have lax management of it relying on their gut or sub-optimal metrics . This sounds lame , it is 2016 after all . But , it is sadly true . Now you know where those job descriptions come from . Part of the responsibility , as I mentioned in # 3 in this post , falls on us , the data people . We spend so much time gathering data , conflate sexier javascript tags with accomplishment , and only have time left over to data puke . We have to change this , else the job descriptions wo n't change . We found that when trying to identify issues or areas of concerns , we wrote queries to identify the Top 25 Negative Noun Tokens in Sentences and include the related sentences after Natural Language Processing . We then grouped those sentences for tagging in an interactive tree ( tree of sentences ) . We were able to identify the top issues affecting consumers , very quickly ; because of the refined sample size ( Top 25 Tokens ) . We would repeat this effort with each week of new data ... slowly becoming the knowledge experts in the source domain . As the unique issues started to dry up we instituted a dynamic filtering system where every keyword in a sentence became a filter . We could shuffle the results with each click , spinning the results . We also implemented the ability to combine those keywords and flip them for even more complex dynamic filters . And then we also started an automatic favourite keyword identification system so that on subsequent weeks of results , I knew which keywords / favs were able to pull back the targeted results we were after . So for those looking to find the top negative issues , this may be a plan of attack in the identification of issues , something you could include in your own system or check out text-analyzer.com to see this in action . Hope this helps someone when the uniqueness in the results seems to dry up . Very thought-provoking ! The reporting vs. analysis issue clearly stands out as THE challenge at the company I work at , in terms of data use . The current trends of "" big data "" and "" lean analytics "" make this old issue very poignant . I wonder about your push for metamorphosing squirrels into ninjas . Is that a natural progression ? Is it the only progression ? The best progression ? You note the importance of posing the right questions the right way with the right people in survey development . Asking open-ended questions to develop the right survey response selections is just one example that highlights the importance of developing good tactical approaches when developing data . You nicely tie in the importance of strategic analysis – the ' why ' question in IABI , which provides fodder for hypothesis development in Lean Analytics . This is a call for thinking about analytics as an expression of human behavior , motivation , and thinking . Changing human behavior is the implicit outcome of all the data analysis , and I like how you draw these connections . I 'm a user experience researcher with a background in experimental psychology . I ca n't help but wonder if a reverse transition , from understanding human behavior into data analytics , could also work , and perhaps provide an even easier metamorphosis . If we place Analysis Ninja at the top of the value pyramid , then it will require a person who has one foot firmly planted in both data and human behavior . Michael : There are a lot of wonderful elements to your comment , thank you for sharing your thoughts . Let me touch on a couple . There is a difference between small and big companies . Small companies need someone as close to an Analysis Ninja as possible , and it would be great if the person can also operate machinery and do marketing . Small companies ca n't afford a lot . : ) Reporting Squirrels at small companies are actively harmful , not only can they drive little change , an investment in them might have an expensive opportunity cost . In big companies , you will , for the next five years or so , need Reporting Squirrels and Analysis Ninjas . Part of the need for Reporting Squirrels is being driven by the fact that big companies simply can not do without the silly charade of data being puked left , right and center . Part of it is that there are some orgs where super-tactical decisions can be made by people in the division , and they just need CDPs more efficiently delivered . More companies are realizing they need Analysis Ninajs because efficient , real-time CDPs are simply not working . From Reporting Squirrel to an Analysis Ninja is not a natural progression . It happens 20 % of the time , but analytical skills are so different than what reporting jobs mandate . It is important to note that Reporting Squirrel is a well paid job , and for many they like the comfort of what the job demands are . Hence , it is a fabulous job if it fits your personality profile , skills and professional goals . To your note on users ... I believe , most especially for digital , we have access to so much quant and qual human behavior data , skills in User Experience Research ( UCD , HCI etc. ) would be immensely valuable to an Analysis Ninja . A lot of market-researchers do not have much appreciation for customer behavior methods , and they end up becoming askers-pukers . A smart marketer at times may not even need too much data , but just some intelligent customer behavior analysis methods and hypotheses to come up insights that will win the game for her . </doc>

1664,A16,"Rossa Matilda Richter Zazel posing with her cannon , at the Royal Aquarium , in 1877 Rossa Matilda Richter ( 1863 – 1937 ) was a circus performer and actor ( stage name , Zazel ) who became the first recorded human cannonball in 1877 , at the age of 14 , launching herself from a spring-style "" cannon "" . Richter was a child actor and got into circus-style performances as a trapeze artist . On 10 April 1877 , she incorporated a new stunt , the human cannonball . The first such performance was at the Royal Aquarium in London when she was 14 . She was fired out of a spring-style cannon , traveling 6.1 metres ( 20 ft ) and landing in a net . According to the Guinness Book of World Records , Richter was the first human cannonball , though the distinction has been contested by others who claim Ella Zuila and George Loyal , also known as "" The Australian Marvels "" , performed the act a few years prior . The cannon was invented by William Leonard Hunt , a Canadian daredevil known as "" The Great Farini "" – U.S. Patent , No. 115 , 837 was issued on 13 June 1871 to "" William Farini , now of London , England certain new and useful Apparatus for Projecting Persons and Articles into or through the Air "" ; and , further , U.S. Patent , no . 214 , 663 was issued on 22 April 1879 to "" William Leonard Hunt , of Westminster and Improvement in Theater Appliances "" – and used rubber springs to limit the distance she would travel , employing a gunpowder - based explosion only for effect . According to P. T. Barnum , who had traveled to London to see the performance , Zazel pleaded with him to take her away . Though she was the star of the act and took the physical risks , Hunt was keeping most of the money the act brought in . Poster advertising one of Zazel's performances at the Royal Aquarium Richter went on tour with Barnum's Circus , performing in France and throughout the United States . She married Barnum's manager , George Oscar Starr ( 1849 – 1915 ) – later , manager of The Crystal Palace – she was his second wife . In 1891 , Richter nearly died in an accident during a show in New Mexico , when either the net was incorrectly placed ( causing her to miss it and hit the ground ) or the net catastrophically failed . She broke her back , effectively retiring her from her career as a human cannonball , and she spent several months in a suspended full body cast . Written in 1938 , by Robert Stevenson and Roland Pertwee , directed by Stevenson , and released in 1939 , the British comedy film Young Man's Fancy was centred on Ada , an Irish human cannonball . The character of Ada was written especially for Anna Lee by Stevenson , her husband , and is "" based on Zazel , the original ' human cannon ball ' , who thrilled London audiences in the nineties by being shot from a cannon "" – however , "" for the purposes of the film ... the period has been put back to the seventies . </doc>

1391,A7,"Real Estate Information Archive Blog Question : Allison , I heard that Congress recently changed some of the capital gains laws . What have you heard ? Answer : Hardly anybody noticed it , but Congress tucked away a valuable bit of holiday cheer for real estate when it passed its final tax bill of the year . It was the first substantive change in years to the generous capital gains rules governing sales of principal homes . According to Kenneth Harney , most homeowners and real estate professionals can recite these rules in their sleep : Married , joint-filing sellers of houses can exclude up to $ 500 , 000 of gain , and single-filing sellers can take up to $ 250 , 000 ... provided they 've used the property as a principal residence for a cumulative two of the previous five years . But what happens when a married home owner dies ? Does the surviving spouse still qualify for the full $ 500 , 000 -- or does she or he only get to exclude $ 250 , 000 ? The answer from the IRS has been this : you only get the full $ 500 , 000 if you sell during the tax year in which you were married and filing a joint return . Otherwise , the tax code sees you as single , and then you 're limited to $ 250 , 000 . In other words , if your wife or husband died in June of 2007 , you can only claim the full $ 500 , 000 benefit if you sell before December 31 , 2007 . After that , as long as you remain unmarried , you 're capped at the $ 250 , 000 limit for single taxpayers . As a practical matter , most surviving spouses inherit their husband's or wife's share of the property at what 's known as a "" stepped up "" tax basis , with no capital gains tax liability at the current market value . Well , now they 've got it . Legislation signed into law before the holiday recess gives surviving spouses two full years to qualify for the $ 500 , 000 exclusion -- even though technically they 're single . And who says Congress does n't have a heart ? Since your tax professional may not be familiar with this yet , here 's the official citation : The bill is H.R. 3648 . The capital gains change is in Section 7 . Question : Our goal for this next year is to buy a home in Summit County . We want to get some information on financing and are considering using an Internet lender . What would be the benefits of working with someone locally versus working with an Internet lender ? Answer : There are numerous advantages when using a local mortgage lender as compared to a mortgage lender obtained over the Internet . Customer service is the number one advantage . A local mortgage lender is familiar with the properties in their area , whereas an Internet lender may have limited knowledge of the requirements associated with a resort area . With a local lender the borrowers will have an individual who is personally working on their loan application , as every borrower's needs and financial situations are unique . The borrower also has a contact person to check the status of their application and to answer any questions they may have . Plus they will be able to speak directly with a local lender without having to play phone tag or leaving messages in voice mail that can be associated with the larger mortgage corporations . This can be frustrating to the borrowers . The lender is responsible for ordering the appraisal on the property , which should be from a local appraiser . This is very important . A local appraiser is familiar with the area and the values of the properties and any changes in the area that can affect those values . When purchasing a condominium unit , local lenders will be familiar with the condominium projects in the area and will know if the project meets the lender's requirements . There is also the working relationship with the local title companies , surveyors and insurance companies to meet the state's requirements to provide each borrower with clear title to the property . There are several steps that must be completed to take a borrower from application to approval to the closing date . Working with the local mortgage lenders , title companies , appraisers and surveyors makes all these steps come together . You have the advantage of the individuals familiar not only with the area but also the requirements of each purchase contract . Purchasing a home whether it 's your first home , vacation home or a rental property can be stressful , working with your local professionals can make this process a lot easier . Question : Our Realtor has suggested that we hire an interior decorator to "" stage "" our home . Is there any benefit in this ? Answer : Originally popularized in California , staging helps homes sell quickly and for more money . Staging concentrates not on changing the interior in terms of painting or adding carpeting , says Carole Talbott of home decorating company Visual Coordinations . These are things the buyers would most likely prefer to choose themselves . Rather staging depends on "" selling the space . "" When a home is staged , it 's reorganized--first with the furniture , then artwork , and finally by accessories . The furnishings remain the same , except for well-worn pieces or those that break up the design . Many times accessories are used to add color to a room . Stagers charge approximately $ 500 to $ 750 for a three-bedroom , two-bath home ; Talbott advises owners to stage only the main living areas to avoid high costs . Some staging advice for homeowners who want to go it alone : furniture should be kept away from walls by grouping at angles in the middle of the room ; colors should be chosen from artwork and fabrics , and accessories should be chosen to accentuate them ; collections should be kept together ; and mirrors should be placed in locations where favorable scenery will reflect . To attract attention to the exterior , the front door should be the first thing painted or decorated . Question : I am thinking of buying a condominium in Summit County and want to find a property with low homeowner's association dues . How important is it for the association to have a capital reserve fund ? Answer : Condominium buyers should be wary of associations that lack adequate reserves--money set aside to pay for emergency or major repairs--because they could be forced to pay special assessments to cover costs when the association can not . Additionally , a future sale or refinancing could be denied based on the association's reserves ; and it is difficult to find a buyer under such conditions . Insufficient reserve funds can lead to declining property values , as educated buyers refrain from purchasing condos in the community , according to the Community Associations Institute , a national nonprofit organization that educates and provides resources to homeowner groups . Annually , an association's board of directors is required to predict the next year's income and expenses--usually through a reserve analysis study . This report consists of a property evaluation--architectural and engineering--by qualified engineers . The engineers determine the useful life and repair costs of things like boilers , elevators , and roofs to determine how much money should be set aside each year to plan for future replacement . The reserve funds are generally collected from the condo owners on a monthly or quarterly basis and deposited into Treasury bills or other secure government-insured funds . If a repair is necessary and the association needs to raise the money immediately , there are three steps it can take : increase the monthly assessment amount ; impose special assessments , in which the owner immediately pays a fee based on the percentage interest he / she has in the association ( sometimes amounting to hundreds of dollars ) ; or get a loan . Answer : Although reverse mortgages are an ideal fit for many senior homeowners , they are not the best option for all of them . A reverse mortgage would not be in the best interest of someone who intends to make a move in the foreseeable future , the AARP and other sources note . Reverse loans usually come with stiff upfront fees and closing costs of up to 10 percent of the loan amount , which are distributed over the life of the loan . Owners who sell their homes quickly will also lose their equity quickly . Reverse mortgages may not be suitable for seniors who want to leave a free-and-clear property behind as a legacy to their heirs . At the same time , some experts say elderly homeowners should consider a reverse loan as a way to meet living expenses or settle medical bills while they are alive , without worrying about what will happen when they die . Their offspring still can keep the property by paying off the reverse mortgage with funds from the estate or with their own money , or by taking out a new mortgage . Experts warn that reverse loans may not be the solution for the youngest seniors , because longer life expectancy qualifies borrowers for less money , or for those in the midst of a temporary financial emergency , who might be better off taking out a home equity line instead . Finally , another alternative , such as selling the property and using the proceeds to downsize into a smaller house or to rent , might make sense for some seniors . Question : Allison , we 've heard a lot about 1031 tax-deferred exchanges and would like to know if our second home would qualify for a like-kind exchange with another piece of property that is closer to our home . We have never rented our current property , but consider it an investment due to it 's appreciation the past few years . Answer : Your question is a good one – and one that has been in the media and in the courts quite a bit in the past few months . To get an accurate assessment of your particular situation , I recommend you speak with a company that specializes in 1031 tax-deferred exchanges . According to Inman News , a similar case to yours was tried in court . Here are the details . In 1988 Barry and Deborah Moore purchased a second home on Clark Hill Lake . It included a home to which the Moores added a deck and other improvements . The property was a three-hour drive from their principal residence . The Moores and their children visited the property two weekends each month between April and September each year . But in 1995 the Moores changed their primary-residence location , making the drive to the Clark Hill Lake property a five - to six-hour trip . As a result , they used the property only a few times each summer . The Clark Hill Lake property was never offered for rent to short - or long-term tenants . On their income-tax returns , the Moores deducted their mortgage interest and property tax payments as personal itemized deductions . In 2000 , the Moores found a five-bedroom , four-bathroom house on 1.2 acres of land adjoining Lake Lanier , just a few hours from their home . It has five screened-in porches , a party deck and veranda . They decided to make an Internal Revenue Code 1031 tax-deferred trade of the Clark Hill Lake property for the larger and closer Lake Lanier property . They justified the exchange by stating both properties were held for "" investment "" rather than for personal use . Upon audit , the IRS denied the IRC 1031 tax-deferral on the sale of the Clark Hill Lake property . The IRS auditor noted the property had never been rented and was used only by the Moore family on weekends . But the Moores argued they held the property as an investment for future appreciation in market value . They took their dispute to the U.S. Tax Court . If you were the judge would you allow the Moores to defer the capital gains tax on the trade of the Clark Hill Lake property as an investment ? The judge said no ! To qualify for an IRC 1031 tax-deferred exchange , the judge began , both properties involved in the trade must be held for investment or for use in a trade or business . Although the Moores pointed to the appreciation potential of the Clark Hill Lake property , he continued , "" It is a taxpayer's primary purpose in holding the properties that counts . "" "" Property held for investment is property held for the production of income , "" the judge explained . "" We accept as fact the Moores hoped that both the Clark Hill and Lake Lanier properties would appreciate , "" he noted . "" Mere hope or expectation that property may be sold at a gain can not establish an investment intent if the taxpayer uses the property as a residence , "" the judge emphasized . There was no convincing proof either property was held for the production of income as a rental since the family used both properties primarily as vacation retreats , he added . Because the evidence strongly showed both vacation homes were held for personal use , rather than for production of income , neither property qualifies for an IRC 1031 tax-deferred exchange , and the Clark Hill Lake property sale is taxable , the judge ruled . </doc>

1352,A12,"Best mattress reviews Pillow top mattress reviews A pillow top mattress is a mattress not less than five inch layer of either latex , memory form , polifiber , wool or even water made to give comfort . They either have a Euro top or a pillow top which gives them their name , Pillow top mattress . Best pillow top mattress : consumer satisfaction Basically , according to pillow top mattress reviews , memory form gives the highest consumer satisfaction of 81 % followed by latex giving a consumer satisfaction of 80 % then water with 79 % and lastly air with 78 % consumer satisfaction Different kinds of these mattresses come in different sizes , prices ranging from 200.00 dollars to 3000.00 dollars or more depending on the sizes , materials and thickness of the pillow top mattresses : queen size ; king size ; double . Lifespan reviews The lifespan of pillow top mattresses is basically three to fifteen years with the biggest percentage having a lifespan of three to five years with a very small percentage giving a lifespan of more than ten years . The initial comfort provided by the mattresses is excellent in the first few years of service ranging from three to ten years depending on the nature of the material used . This happens due to the sagging effect of the materials in the mattresses . Due to the compression from the forces exerted on the mattresses the materials tend to compress and therefore the pain relieving effect on the pillow top , the comfort effect and the deep sleep reduces with continuous usage of the pillow top mattresses . This is more observable in the air or inner spring mattresses . However , weight of a person is not a factor of their sagging effect , but the materials used with the ones made from memory form giving highest percentage of sagging after the first few year of usage ranging from three to five years . Warming and odour effect Pillow top mattresses have a lot of reviews about it 's warming effect to the consumers . This is because they trap air in them which warms up itself and therefore give out relative warmth when it is cold . Mattresses especially with memory form are known to give out more warmth than the other materials , this is because memory form has spaces in it which trap air in them which later warms up therefore giving more heat than the other materials . This results to an uncomfortable sleeping surface due to the warmth . Compared to non pillow mattresses , pillow mattresses give more heat and twice as likely to produce odours as non pillow mattresses . The awful odors produced can last from a few hours to some weeks especially with memory form mattresses . Pillow top mattress relieving effect review Pain relieving function of the pillow top mattresses is excellent on in the first years of usage , they relieve pain on hip , back and shoulder , however , this reduces as the mattress is continuously used , after sagging , do n't expect much relieve of your pains from the mattresses . Pillow top mattresses with memory form relieve pain faster than pillow top mattresses without memory form . Storage </doc>

STRAWBALE BUILDING FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS Most people have grown up through childhood and beyond into adulthood with the tale of the Three Little Pigs , so when first faced with the notion of building with straw the immediate reaction is to say , "" surely you cant build a house out of straw , we all know what happened to the little pigs straw house "" and then they usually huff and puff a little . I usually say , "" that 's what you get if you let a pig build your house "" HOW ABOUT FIRE ? loose straw does burn , but when compressed tightly and tied into a bale it is almost impossible to burn , just as loose paper will burn , but try setting fire to a telephone directory , and when straw bales are covered in render their performance is even better ! Straw bales have been fire tested beyond any doubt and have even satisfied the Australian Bushire Tests , QUOTE "" Brian Menadue from SA Country Fire Service stated that it was important for the strawbale industry to test this new material and he was satisfied that rendered strawbale would be an acceptable wall material . The testing has proved that used in wall construction , rendered strawbales are suitable for use in bushfire-prone areas . They are non-combustible to the stringent tests that were carried out by the CSIRO . Rendered strawbale walls now stand together with mudbrick and rammed earth as alternative building materials "" Check out the full story by following the link . Bushfire tests WHAT ABOUT MOISTURE ? moisture is the only real enemy of straw bales , if your bales get wet and have a moisture content above 20 % then they will rot . BUT with careful attention there is no need for your bales to get wet , a few simple rules can prevent this . Build your foundation a minimum of 6-8 inches above ground level and make sure that you have good damproofing and give the roof a generous ( 2ft ) overhang . This is the equivalent of a good hat and boots , along with regularly limewashing the exterior render , should prevent moisture from entering your bales . WHAT ABOUT RATS AND MICE ? Rats and mice usually like to run around in the cavities between walls , with strawbale walls there are no cavities for them to lurk in , also the walls are usually lime rendered which rats and mice can not chew through as the lime will soon dry their mouths out . I have never come across an owner of a strawbale house that has a problem with rats and mice . ARE STRAWBALE BUILDINGS STRUCTURALLY SAFE ? Strawbale buildings are as safe if not safer than any conventional building , they have been thoroughly tested for load bearing and are capable of structural loading far in excess of any accepted requirements , it has even been noted that when loaded to failure point that they fail in an unspectacular fashion when compared to conventional building materials . ARE STRAWBALE BUILDINGS CHEAP TO BUILD ? The cost of building a 3-4 bedroom strawbale house will not really be any cheaper than a conventional build , there is possibly a slight saving on the cost of the walls but everything else , foundation , roof , doors , windows , services etc is the same , BUT for the same costs as a conventional build you end up with a superinsulated house . Many people who build with strawbales manage to lower their building costs by becoming dedicated recyclers and scroungers and by using friends and family for labour , in this way it is possible to build fairly cheaply . DO I NEED PLANNING PERMISSION FOR A STRAWBALE BUILDING ? In most cases the answer is yes you do need planning permission , however some buildings ( in back gardens etc ) fall under the Generally Permitted Development Order and if they are built within certain guidelines require no planning permission . Planning authorities are only interested in whether a building is allowed in the actual area , and the size and shape and actual location , they are not concerned with the materials you use to build with , this is a matter for the Building Control Officer . Check out the full story by following the link . Planning Index HOW LONG WILL A STRAWBALE BUILDING LAST ? Here in the UK we have only been building with straw bales since the mid 1990's , so have no real precedent for longevity , however there are SB buildings in the USA that are almost a hundred years old SB historic buildings and at least one in France Historic SB building France that dates back to 1921 . Like all buildings if it is regularly maintained a SB building should last indefinately . </doc>

409,A7,"( 4 miles [ 7 km ] one way ) This walk follows part of the old railway line between Dufftown and Craigellachie , now a spur of the Speyside Way . Start from the car park at Craigellachie , following the signs for Dufftown . For much of its length , the old line follows the course of the river Fiddich , name to one of Scotland's most famous malt whiskies ( Glen Fiddich means Valley of the Deer ) . This walk lies in a wooded gorge cut by the peaty-brown river , and is peaceful throughout . Look out for red squirrels on the way . After crossing the river , the course of the walkway leaves the railway to cross farmland on the approach to Balvenie ( home to another whisky ) and then Dufftown itself . The walkway ends near the site of a former station , but it is worth continuing along the road for the double attraction of Balvenie Castle and Glenfiddich Distillery . Return to Craigellachie the same way , or by bus . </doc>

1337,A11,"You gotta love the babies ! But milk supply is crucial to their survival . As if the anticipation of a newborn foal and a healthy delivery were n't stress enough , there is nothing scarier than questioning whether or not a foal has had enough colostrum within 12-24 hours of birth . And believe me , a mare that does n't seem to be producing sufficient milk afterwards , will make you question that very fact . First and Foremost : Colostrum is the life-giving substance which prepares a newborn foal for life . Since a brand new baby horse is totally and immunologically , vulnerable to the challenges of the outside world , colostrum deriving from the mare's teat immediately after birth is Mother Nature's way of delivering precious antibodies into a foal's system . A new foal must get enough colostrum through passive transfer , within 12-24 hours of birth . Therefore , if you find yourself in a situation where a mare is not producing enough milk several hours later , or the next morning , you must ascertain whether or not the foal received adequate colostrum . I can not stress this aspect enough . A mare without milk is almost the same situation as an orphan foal . You have to make wise decisions and fast . Determining colostrum intake is often done via a SNAP test or serum chemistry , to ensure antibody levels are adequate . Of Second Importance : The results of a SNAP test are obtained very quickly – in something like 7 minutes . If it is determined that plasma or frozen colostrum is necessary , it is still important to remember that the foal also needs nutrition for energy . There are a few equine replacement supplements on the market that can help to feed the foal . These include ; Equilac , Foalac or Kid Milk ( the latter primarily being used for cattle ) . But it 's important to note that milk replacers DO NOT substitute colostrum . Once a foal is is verified to have sufficient colostrum levels , providing adequate nutrition is the next big hurdle . Dr. Dennis Rach of Moore & Co. in Calgary , Alberta , gave me this helpful tip recently : Dextrose is used as an aid in the treatment of glucose deficiencies in cattle . When added to 2 % milk , it provides the nutrients a foal requires , plus , it helps to "" sweeten "" the milk slightly , to better simulate the taste of a mare's milk . If milk replacer is necessary , a foal needs to consume milk replacer every 2-4 hours . ( This makes life very difficult , but it needs to be done . ) And a foal must consume 16-18 % of its body weight in milk per day . For example , a 60 pound foal must consume 6 pounds of milk per day . It also possible to induce lactation . Certain treatment protocols have resulted in milk production ranging from 25 % to 82 % in success rates . However , induced lactation does not begin with a production of colostrum . Domperidone ( check it out at equitoxpharma.com ) has been used in recent years with good success , to increase endogenous prolactin secretion in mares ( either in advancing the onset of reproductive activity in early spring or to counter the ill effects of fescue toxicosis in pregnant mares at term . ) And of course , check out www.cyberfoal.com in you have an orphan foal , or have a mare suffering from agalactia ( non-production of milk ) . This website works !! It has proven to be a valuable tool for matching orphan foals with nurse mares . At CyberFoal.com , you can apply for a nurse mare or post your own mare up for a newborn foal adoption ( if she has lost her foal ) and help to benefit someone else who may have an orphan . You can also apply for colostrum or read listings as to where colostrum banks may be located . Altogether , CyberFoal.com is a brilliant , valuable website for owners in dire need of colostrum or nurse mare matches . Share this : Alright , I know Mother's day was this past weekend . And it 's not that I 'm trying to make up for not calling and visiting with my beloved Mother ( s ) and Grandmothers . ' Cause I did . My Mom has a very special place in my heart . She was a single mother who struggled , but somehow managed to raise two healthy , vibrant daughters . So although it 's belated , I thought I 'd share a couple of "" Mother Scenes "" out in our front pasture right now . Since I do n't yet have kids of my own , these are what my Mom proudly refers to as her "" Grand-fillies and colts . "" And on that note – why do we need one day to celebrate our Moms anyways ? They have been there for us 365 days a year since our lives began . We should be thanking God and commemorating everything they have done for us – every day . Our mothers have taken care of us . Nurtured and fed us , without question . They have stood by our sides , even when we may have been a little "" nerdy "" at times . Moms are always proud , no matter what we do . They protected us from danger . They taught us how to run and play . And how to survive . Share this : Okay , since this colt starting entry has spanned over several days , let 's go back to the beginning of Clay's first saddling concept . Yesterday , my husband desensitized Mercedes to the saddle pad . Now , he 's going to throw his colt starting saddle ( one that he does n't mind if it gets beat up a little bit ) , directly onto Mercedes' back . He does n't pause or creep up to her with the saddle – Clay simply throws it over like it 's no big deal . Of course , Mercedes is not sure what to make of the object but just the same , she allows it to remain on her back . Note the cinch is not done up at this point . Clay moves Mercedes around , so she feels the weight of the pad and the saddle on her back . Next , Clay drops the cinches on the near side and walks around to the horse's left side to do them up . Very carefully , Clay begins doing up the front cinch . Notice , he has moved Mercedes closer to the fence in case Clay needs to jump up on it quickly to get out of harm's way ... Then Clay slips the rope halter off Mercedes' head and places it around her neck instead . This is because Clay will now – carefully – do up the back cinch . And it 's likely that once the filly feels the back cinch for the first time she will be outta there ... Whew ! The lesson is n't done for today , Clay will continue to do some roundpen reasoning with Mercedes until she responds correctly to him , while still wearing the saddle . Then , he find a good note to end the lesson on . Clay will halter Mercedes and safely remove the saddle ( by undoing the back cinch first ) . And the filly will be allowed an extensive cool-down period , followed by a good grooming session . Finally , she is returned to her stall . In all , Mercedes has handled Clay's first saddling lessons extremely well . There was a little excitement , but nothing out of the ordinary . Neither Clay , nor Mercedes was hurt and a lot was accomplished in terms of the filly's training in a very short time . Please let me reiterate – Clay is a professional horse trainer . Therefore , he has a tonne of experience in the colt starting department . He also has specific roundpen equipment that he uses . The blog entries appearing in My Stable Life are by no means , a recipe for DIYers ... They are merely an inside view into the art of training young horses . I hope you enjoyed these sessions and we will be back with more "" Insider Training "" very soon . Cheers ! Share this : Clay intends to saddle Mercedes today , for the first time in her life . But for the purposes of breaking the concept up into easy-to understand portions , I will separate the steps into two more blog entries ( today and tomorrow ) . To get Mercedes used to the sensation of a front or back cinch ( since she has never worn one before ) , Clay tosses a lead rope around her barrel . Mercedes is not tied , she is allowed to move around the roundpen as she pleases . However , the goal is for Clay to apply light pressure to her barrel with the rope and when she yields , Clay releases the pressure . If at any time , Mercedes decides to run off , Clay releases his grip on the lead rope and lets her go . There 's no sense in either of them getting hurt or Mercedes becoming scared . In this case , Clay would simply re-catch Mercedes and try again . Today , Mercedes stays put and really puts a lot of effort into trying to comprehend what Clay is asking . Here , she investigates the rope and even tries relieving the pressure by biting it . Although biting is never desirable , Mercedes is clearly curious . Mercedes yields to the pressure and Clay releases the pressure by putting slack in the rope . Next , Clay will introduce the saddle pad to our filly . Note he has now put a rope halter on Mercedes . Clay presses the blanket to Mercedes' sides , an attempt to desensitize her to it . Then he quickly and assertively throws the blanket on her back . At this point , Clay always says "" Do n't mess around here . Just throw the blanket up there like she 's had it done numerous times . "" Otherwise , if Clay had tried throwing the pad on Mercedes in a fashion that implied she should be afraid of it , she probably would spook away . He lets the pad rest on Mercedes' back . Clay moves the pad all over Mercedes' body and desensitizes her to it . He wants her to realize she has nothing to fear in the saddle pad . Repeating the process over and over , Clay throws the pad over Mercedes' back until she is comfortable and relaxes with the concept . He will even move her around a bit and let Mercedes feel the pad on her back in motion . If it falls off , that 's okay . It simply gives Clay another chance to throw the pad on her again . When Mercedes relaxes her body and displays such body language as lowering her head , licking her lips and relaxing her tail , he is confident with her progress . This concludes the first portion of the first saddling lesson . Share this : In Mercedes' first roundpen lesson ( posted April 4 , 2010 ) , the young yearling filly was brought into our arena roundpen and taught the basics of human handling . While this filly is already halter broke , Clay basically wanted to teach her to have her attention on him at all times . The first session took approximately 25 minutes and when it was done , Mercedes willingly allowed Clay to approach her and touch her shoulders with his lariat . He did this using an "" Approach and Retreat "" philosophy . In this next lesson , Clay will put Mercedes through the same paces as in the first session , but the goal this time is to be able to touch her in several areas of the body without Mercedes retreating . Clay tests out what was learned in the first lesson . Mercedes is definitely unsure but she has not moved away from Clay's lariat yet . Clay was unable to really "" touch "" Mercedes , so he sends her around the roundpen to work . He wants the filly's heart , lungs and muscles to help explain to Mercedes that it would be a lot easier to just stand and allow Clay to touch her body . Still , Mercedes declines Clay's invitation to stand , so he sends her around to work again , taking great care to stand back from her hindquarters . Finally the filly thinks about it a little bit and turns to face Clay . He approaches her . Clay wants to be able to rub her all over , with the lariat .

"" Share this : Our mare is a 2007 model which we purchased from a reputable breeder . Upon picking her up , we discovered a fungus-like patch extending from her right wither down to her right gaskin . The condition did not seem to be bothering her ( it was n't itchy ) , however if it was a fungus that could be transferred to another animal , this was a concern to us . Therefore , following several veterinarian examinations and various topical anti-fungal preparations , one of our vets suggested that we do a skin biopsy . This test produced accurate results . And while knowing what we were dealing with was a huge relief , we could n't help but feel slightly forlorn when we finally did get a proper diagnosis . Equine Linear Keratosis occurs as vertical linear areas of alopecia ( or near alopecia ) , scaling and crust formation on the sides of the horse's neck , or shoulder or chest . The condition is characterized by the gradual development of annular areas of alopecia , usually in a linear , vertically oriented configuration . In our mare's case , her shoulder looked as though someone had spilled a chemical down her body – a scenario we even considered for a while . The lesions are usually 2 to 10mm wide by a few cm to more than 1m in length . The lesions are neither painful nor pruritic . Our horse is n't itchy and the skin seems healthy otherwise . Linear keratosis accounts for 0.67 per cent of the equine dermatology cases seen at the Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine . Meaning , the condition is very rare . At the blue arrow , you can faintly see the change of coat color that occurs due to the linear keratosis . Since the diagnosis , we have learned that it is possibly a hereditary condition and it may never disappear . However , linear keratosis is not contagious and luckily , it can not pass from our mare to her stable mate or any other horses she may come into contact with . And aside from its blemish appearance , our mare's skin disorder really does n't affect her . She is not sore in that area and it had never affected her training .

1290,A17,"Book Reviews Promoting Health : The Primary Health Care Approach - Second Edition It is the author's hope that this book will reflect the spirit of primary health care . This will contribute to a growing understanding among health workers of health promoting work , both at local and international levels . This hope is achieved because the book is based on principles of effective , balanced , appropriate and just health system . It focuses on barriers for implementing primary health care and health promotion strategies and in particular why these are looking increasingly at odds against economic rationalism . The latter is very useful to the reader to gain an understanding on why the commitment to primary health approach is weakening despite its principles being more challenged . This book is designed to provide both a theoretical introduction and practical strategies for action . The reader is expected to have a basic understanding of sociology , psychology , health and illness , however , it is based on an examination of skills and issues addressed in undergraduate nursing and health science courses . It is an essential book for students in the field and an excellent guidebook for the more experienced . The second edition has been improved by an excellent reference list at the end of each chapter . The reader is also encouraged to further readings by directions to references entwined in the text . This makes it very easy to seek more information on particular issues . Also , compared to first edition , major historical developments have been up dated and more emphasis is placed on barriers to implementation of the primary health approach . The book consists of ten chapters , which starts with an examination of the development of primary health care at both Australian and International levels . The first chapter discusses the development of the new public health movement and gives examples of major barriers in implementing primary health care . Some major policy development processes in Australia are discussed in relation to the extent to which these policies embrace the primary health approach . Chapter two defines health and health promotion and contains related discussions of value-based issues within the two concepts . The discussions raise questions , which force the reader to reflect on the complexities of the health promotion activities , in particular the concept of participation has been examined and provides the reader with a good understanding of this concept . Chapter three introduces research in the areas of health promotion and examines the major issues in community needs assessment . The chapter argues successfully about the importance of research for an ongoing integrated health promotion practice . It focuses on two methodologies namely ; feminist research and participatory action research and explains how those methods are particularly appropriate in health promotional work . Chapter four explores the issues in evaluation of primary health and health promotion . It argues that community assessment and evaluation ought to be a recurring process in good health promotional work and explains why the lines between the two concepts can be very fine . The discussion emphases , faithfully to the primary health approach , that participatory evaluation must be a key feature in practice . The planning , component and process in evaluation is described and the Australian health and community service standards are suggested as a framework for helping with this process . Chapters 5 to 9 explore a number of strategies useful in promoting health - working with mass media , community development , working for public policy change , group work and health education . The four chapters can be read independent of each others as each chapter is based on primary health care approach explained in the first four chapters in the book . Most importantly to successful health promotional work is that of working in-groups and understanding group dynamics . Chapter eight offers a very good insight and is ( again ) full of useful advice . Chapter nine is of great importance , in particular to the novice practitioner , as it assists excellently to understand why the choice of educational methods is critical for successful outcomes of health promotional work . Chapter ten makes a number of suggestions about how to incorporate the range of material presented in the book into own practice of the reader . It provides a very useful guide for anyone considering "" doing project "" . It gives practical suggestions to how to implement health promotion activities and concludes by pulling it all together . It also raises some critical questions for the reader to consider in relation to future activities . This is an excellent dictionary for the experienced health practitioner and encourages to continuing education . Reading this book makes you feel like you have "" spoken "" to some one who has spend for a long time in the field . A great gift to all of us involved in primary health care at all levels . </doc>

312,A8,"As each week passes , Sleaford Town are getting stronger and stronger . The Team put out against Coleby on this balmy September afternoon was more in keeping with the Manager's expectations to see Sleaford Town do very well in the Lincoln league . The game started brightly with Gibson hitting the woodwork after only 6minutes with a fierce drive only for Coleby to force a first class save from Ben Jackson in the Sleaford goal with a looping header after 15 minutes . Sleaford , with Hanlon , Morley , and Musson dictating play , were winning the midfield battle . It was a flowing move through the midfield culminating in Sleaford's bright new signing Reece racing away down the left before setting up Gibson from 25 yds to do what he does best and score with a fine shot into the top corner . The best of Sleaford's defence was in evidence after 44 minutes when after Hill & Greenslade had snuffed out another Coleby attack , Goalkeeper Jackson then quickly threw the ball to Sweeper Fox . Fox then carried the ball 30 yds before delivering a fine ball to Reece who flicked on for Morley to score with his ' Bryan Robson ' style late run from Midfield . 2-0 at half time . Same story after the break with Sleaford looking the stronger team . Costa gave way to young Martin Dickinson , and it was Martin's strong run and magnificent left foot strike that sealed the victory 3-0 after 69 minutes . Ryan McGuinness replaced Mark Brayfield who had played very well in his first start of the season . Ryan once again showed why he is one for the future with great touches and intelligent running . Carl Roberts replaced Hanlon with 8 minutes remaining and the Player Manager had a chance to put the icing on the cake with a forth goal from 6yds only to blaze wildly over ( to an ironic cheer from his prodigies ) All in all a good days work and the signs are good to continue the early success . </doc>

167,A1,"These are grim economic times fellow TEDsters , grim economic times indeed . And so , I would like to cheer you up with one of the great , albeit largely unknown , commercial success stories of the past 20 years . Comparable , in its own very peculiar way , to the achievements of Microsoft or Google . And it 's an industry which has bucked the current recession with equanimity . I refer to organized crime . Now organized crime has been around for a very long time , I hear you say . And these would be wise words , indeed . But in the last two decades it has experienced an unprecedented expansion . Now accounting for roughly 15 percent of the world's GDP . I like to call it the Global Shadow Economy , or McMafia , for short . So what triggered this extraordinary growth in cross-border crime ? Well , of course , there is globalization , technology , communications , all that stuff , which we 'll talk about a little bit later . But first , I would like to take you back to this event . The collapse of communism . All across Eastern Europe , a most momentous episode in our post-war history . Now it 's time for full disclosure . This event meant a great deal to me personally . I had started smuggling books across the iron curtain to Democratic opposition groups in Eastern Europe , like Solidarity in Poland , when I was in my teens . I then started writing about Eastern Europe , and eventually I became the BBC's chief correspondent for the region . Which is what I was doing in 1989 . And so when 425 million people finally won the right to chose their own governments I was ecstatic . But I was also a touch worried about some of the nastier things lurking behind the wall . It was n ' t long , for example , before ethnic nationalism reared its bloody head in Yugoslavia . And amongst the chaos , amidst the euphoria , it took me a little while to understand that some of the people who had wielded power before 1989 , in Eastern Europe , continued to do so after the revolutions there . Obviously there were characters like this . But there were also more unexpected people who played a critical role in what was going on in Eastern Europe . Like this character . Remember these guys ? They used to win the gold medals in weightlifting and wrestling , every four years in the Olympics . And they were the great celebrities of communism . With a fabulous lifestyle to go with it . The used to get great apartments in the center of town . Casual sex on tap . And they could travel to the West very freely , which was a great luxury at the time . It may come as a surprise , but they played a critical role in the emergence of the market economy in Eastern Europe . Or as I like to call them , they are the midwives of capitalism . Here are some of those same wieghtlifters after their 1989 makeover . Now in Bulgaria , this photograph was taken in Bulgaria , when communism collapsed all over Eastern Europe it was n ' t just communism , it was the state that collapsed as well . That means your police force was n ' t working . The court system was n ' t functioning properly . So what was a business man in the brave new world of East European capitalism going to do to make sure that his contracts would be honored ? Well , he would turn to people who were called , rather prosaically by sociologists , privatized law enforcement agencies . We prefer to know them as the mafia . And in Bulgaria , the mafia was soon joined with 14 thousand people who were sacked from their jobs in the security services between 1989 and 1991 . Now , when your state is collapsing , your economy is heading south at a rate of knots , the last people you want coming on to the labor market are 14 thousand men and women whose chief skills are surveillance , are smuggling , building underground networks , and killing people . But that 's what happened all over Eastern Europe . Now , when I was working in the 1990s I spent most of the time covering the appalling conflict in Yugoslavia . And I could n ' t help notice that the people who were perpetrating the appalling atrocities , the paramilitary organizations , were actually the same people running the organized criminal syndicates . And I came to think that behind the violence lay a sinister criminal enterprise . And so I resolved to travel around the world examining this global criminal underworld by talking to policemen , by talking to victims , by talking to consumers of illicit goods and services . But above all else , by talking to the gangsters themselves . And the Balkans was a fabulous place to start . Why ? Well of course there was the issue of law and order collapsing . But also , as they say in the retail trade , it 's location location location . And what I noticed at the beginning of my research that the Balkans had turned into a vast transit zone for illicit goods and services coming from all over the world . Heroin , cocaine , women being trafficked into prostitution and precious minerals . And where were they heading ? The European Union , which by now was beginning to reap the benefits of globalization . Transforming it into the most affluent consumer market in history . Eventually comprising some 500 million people . And a significant minority of those 500 million people like to spend some of their leisure time and spare cash sleeping with prostitutes , sticking 50 Euro notes up their nose and employing illegal migrant laborers . Now , organized crime in a globalizing world operates in the same way as any other business . It has zones of production , like Afghanistan and Columbia . It has zones of distribution , like Mexico and the Balkans . And then , of course , it has zones of consumption , like the European Union , Japan and of course , the United States . The zones of production and distribution tend to lie in the developing world . And they are often threatened by appalling violence and bloodshed . Take Mexico for example . Six thousand people killed there in the last 18 months as a direct consequence of the cocaine trade . But what about the Democratic Republic of Congo ? Since 1998 , five million people have died there . It 's not a conflict you read about much in the newspapers . But it 's the biggest conflict on this planet since the Second World War . And why is it ? Because mafias from all around the world cooperate with local paramilitaries in order to seize the supplies of the rich mineral resources of the region . In the year 2000 , 80 percent of the world's coltan was sourced to the killing fields of the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo . Now coltan you will find in almost every mobile phone , in almost every laptop and games console . The Cogolese war lords were selling this stuff to the mafia in exchange for weapons . And the mafia would then sell it on to Western markets . And it is this Western desire to consume that is the primary driver of international organized crime . Now , let me show you some of my friends in action , caught conveniently on film by the Italian police and smuggling duty-not-paid cigarettes . Now , cigarettes out the factory gate are very cheap . The European Union then imposes the highest taxes on them in the world . So if you can smuggle them into the E. U. there are very handsome profits to be made . And I want to show you this to demonstrate the type of resources available to these groups . This boat is worth one million Euros when it 's new . And it 's the fastest thing on European waters . From 1994 , for seven years , 20 of these boats made the trip across the Adriatic , from Montenegro to Italy , every single night . And as a consequence of this trade Britain alone lost eight billion dollars in revenue . And instead that money went to underwrite the wars in Yugoslavia and line the pockets of unscrupulous individuals . Now Italian police , when this trade started , had just two boats which could go at the same speed . And this is very important , because the only way you can catch these guys is if they run out of gas . Sometimes the gangsters would bring with them women being trafficked into prostitution . And if the police intervened , they would hurl the women into the sea so that the police had to go and save them from drowning , rather than chasing the bad guys . So I have shown you this to demonstrate how many boats , how many vessels it takes to catch one of these guys . And the answer is six vessels . And remember , 20 of these speed boats were coming across the Adriatic every single night . So what were these guys doing with all the money they were making ? Well , this is where we come to globalization because that was not just the deregulation of global trade . It was the liberalization of international financial markets . And boy did that make it easy for the money launderers . The last two decades have been the champagne era for dirty lucre . In the 1990s we saw financial centers around the world competing for their business . And there was simply no effective mechanism to prevent money laundering . And a lot of licit banks were also happy to accept deposits from very dubious sources without questions being asked . But at the heart of this , is the offshore banking network . Now these things are an essential part of the money laundering parade . And if you want to do something about illegal tax evasion and transnational organized crime , money laundering , you have to get rid of them . On a positive note , we at last have someone in the White House who has consistently spoken out against these corrosive entities . And if anyone is concerned about what I believe is the necessity for new legislation , regulation , effective regulation , I say , let 's take a look at Bernie Madoff , who is now going to be spending the rest of his life in jail . Bernie Madoff stole 65 billion dollars . That puts him up there on the Olympus of gangsters with the Colombian cartels , and the major Russian crime syndicates . But he did this for decades in the very heart of Wall Street . And no regulator picked up on it . So how many other Madoffs are there on Wall street , or in the city of London , fleecing ordinary folk , and money laundering ? Well I can tell you , it 's quite a few of them . Let me go on to the 101 of international organized crime now . And that is narcotics . Our second marijuana farm photograph for the morning . This one , however , is in central British Columbia where I photographed it . It 's one of the tens of thousands of mom-and-pop grow-ops in B. C. which ensure that over five percent of the province's GDP is accounted for by this trade . Now I was taken by inspector Brian Cantera , of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police , to a cavernous warehouse east of Vancouver to see some of the goods which are regularly confiscated by the RCMP from the smugglers who are sending it , of course , down south to the United States where there is an insatiable market for B. C. Bud , as it 's called , in part because it 's marketed as organic , which of course goes down very well in California . ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Now even by the police's asmission this makes not a dent in the profits , really , of the major exporters . Since the beginning of globalization the global narcotics market has expanded enormously . There has , however , been no concomitant increase in the resources available to police forces . This , however , may all be about to change . Because something very strange is going on . The United Nations recognized earlier this , it was last month actually , that Canada has become a key area of distribution and production of ecstasy and other synthetic drugs . Interestingly , the market share of heroin and cocaine is going down because the pills are getting ever better at reproducing their highs . Now that is a game changer . Because it shifts production away from the developing world and into the Western world . When that happens it is a trend which is set to overwhelm our policing capacity in the West . The drugs policy which we 've had in place for 40 years is long overdue for a very serious rethink , in my opinion . Now , the recession . Well , organized crime has already adapted very well to the recession . Not surprising , the most opportunistic industry in the whole world . And it has no rules to its regulatory system . Except , of course , it has two business risks , arrest by law enforcement , which is , frankly , the least of their worries , and competition from other groups , i . e . a bullet in the back of the head . What they 've done is they 've shifted their operations . People do n't smoke as much dope , or visit prostitutes quite so frequently during a recession . And so instead they have invaded financial and corporate crime in a big way , but above all , two sectors , and that is counterfeit goods and cybercrime . And its been terribly successful . I would like to introduce you to Mr. Pringle . Or perhaps I should say , more accurately , Señor Pringle . I was introduced to this bit of kit by a Brazilian cybercriminal . We sat in a car on the Avenue Paulista in São Paulo , together . Hooked it up to my laptop , and within about five minutes he had penetrated the computer security system of a major Brazilian bank . It 's really not that difficult . And it 's actually much easier because the fascinating thing about cybercrime is that it 's not so much the technology . The key to cybercrime is what we call social engineering . Or to use the technical term for it , there 's one born every minute . You would not believe how easy it is to persuade people to do things with their computers which are objectively not in their interest . And it was very soon when the cybercriminals learned that the quickest way to do this , of course , the quickest way to a person's wallet is through the promise sex and love . I expect some of you remember the I-Love-You virus , one of the very great worldwide viruses that came . I was very fortunate when the ILOVEYOU virus came out . Because the first person I received it from was an ex-girlfriend of mine . Now she harbored all sorts of sentiments and emotions towards me at the time , but love was not amongst them . ( Laughter ) And so as soon as I saw this drop into my inbox I dispatched it hastily to the recycle bin , and spared myself a very nasty infection . So , cybercrime , do watch out for it . One thing that we do know that the internet is doing is , the internet is assisting these guys . These are mosquitos who carry the malarial parasite which infests our blood when the mosy has had a free meal at our expense . Now , Artesunate is a very effective drug at destroying the parasite in the early days of infection . But over the past year or so researchers in Cambodia have discovered that what 's happening is the malarial parasite is developing a resistance . And they fear that the reason it 's developing a resistance is because Cambodians ca n ' t afford the drugs on the commercial market , and so they buy it from the Internet . And these pills contain only low doses of the active ingredient . Which is why things are , the parasite is beginning to develop a resistance . The reason I say this is because we have to know that organized crime impacts all sorts of areas of our lives . You do n't have to sleep with prostitutes or take drugs in order to have a relationship with organized crime . They affect our bank accounts . They affect our communications , our pension funds . They even affect the food that we eat and our governments . This is no longer an issue of Sicilians from Palermo and New York . There is no romance involved with gangsters in the 21st Century . This is a mighty industry and it creates instability and violence wherever it goes . It is a major economic force and we need to take it very , very seriously . It 's been a privilege talking to you . Thank you very much . ( Applause ) </content> </doc>

11,A1,"François Hollande's Wrong Idea of France LONDON – France's new president , François Hollande , has achieved a remarkable series of political victories – at home and in Europe – since his election in May . Unfortunately , his streak of success will inevitably call forth an economic reckoning that will shock France's apparently unsuspecting citizens and doom the French elite's approach to the "" construction of Europe . "" Since winning the presidency , Hollande has won a parliamentary majority and pushed Germany toward accepting joint liability for eurozone countries' debts . But forebodings of crisis have become widespread in French business and economic circles . But the real danger – which even Hollande's sternest critics may be underestimating – is not so much his individual policy failings ( serious though they may be ) as his approach to the twin challenges posed by France's economic imbalances and the eurozone crisis . On each front separately , he might manage to muddle through ; together , they look likely to cement France's loss of competitiveness . Declining competitiveness is best captured in a single indicator : unit labor costs , which measure the average cost of labor per unit of output . In a monetary union , discrepancies in wage growth relative to productivity gains – that is , unit labor costs – will result in a chronic accumulation of trade surpluses or deficits . Since the euro's introduction , unit labor costs have risen dramatically faster in France than they have in Germany . According to Eurostat data published in April 2011 , the hourly labor cost in France was € 34 . 2 , compared to € 30 . 1 in Germany – and nearly 20 % higher than the eurozone average of € 27 . 6 . France's current-account deficit has risen to more than 2 % of GDP , even as its economic growth has ground to a halt . The high cost of employing workers in France is due not so much to wages and benefits as it is to payroll taxes levied on employers . The entire French political class has long delighted in taxing labor to finance the country's generous welfare provisions , thus avoiding excessively high taxation of individuals' income and consumption – though that is about to come to an end as Hollande intends to slap a 75 % tax on incomes above € 1 million . This is a version of the fallacy that taxing companies ( "" capital "" ) spares ordinary people ( "" workers "" ) . Of course , such taxes on firms are always passed on to households – usually through straightforward price hikes , and , in France , also through unemployment . High tax rates on labor – together with rigid regulation of hiring and firing – make employers extremely reluctant to recruit workers . As a result , France has had chronic long-term unemployment – forecast to reach 10.5 % by 2013 – for many years . Hollande's predecessor , Nicolas Sarkozy , tried to address this problem . He exempted voluntary overtime pay from employment tax and shifted some of the burden of labor taxation onto consumption ( via a hike in VAT ) . But Hollande quickly reversed both of these reforms . The repeal of the tax break on overtime reflects another economic fallacy to which French Socialist politicians are deeply attached : the "" lump of labor "" notion that underlay the most disastrous of their economic policies – the 35-hour workweek , introduced in 2000 . The idea behind the policy is that demand for labor is a constant , and that this fixed number of aggregate working hours required by employers to meet final demand can be spread more evenly among workers to reduce unemployment . Such measures , designed to create jobs by freeing up work hours , are futile at best , and are often detrimental . French Socialists should recall their school physics lesson about communicating vessels : when a homogeneous liquid is poured into a set of connected containers , it settles at the same level in all of them , regardless of their shape and volume . Generating more "" liquid "" ( jobs ) requires not discouraging the entrepreneurs on whose activities sustainable job creation ultimately depends . The effect of fiscal and regulatory pressure on employment is to encourage French firms to invest and hire outside France . Hollande's apologists praise his gradualist and consensual approach to addressing the economy's structural distortions . They argue that his penchant for setting up consultative commissions is the best way to forge the consensus required for structural reform , whereas Sarkozy's combative style was counterproductive . Even banishing skepticism and assuming that Hollande could over time persuade his supporters to embrace competitiveness-boosting policies , the eurozone crisis is denying France the time that such gradualism requires . A simple , effective way to buy time would be to abandon the euro and restore competitiveness through a devalued national currency . But this expedient is incompatible with mainstream French politicians' devotion to the "" European project , "" which amounts to a projection of French soft power ; indeed , building Europe lies at the heart of the French establishment's version of what Charles de Gaulle used to call "" a certain idea of France . "" For mainstream French politicians , renouncing the European project to buy the time required to restore competitiveness is as unthinkable as is the logical alternative : an all-out push for full European political union . This would reestablish monetary sovereignty and create a normal central bank ( like the Federal Reserve or the Bank of England ) at the European level . But it would also mean abandoning France's republic in favor of a federal European government – anathema to that "" certain idea of France . "" The combination of gradualism ( on the most generous interpretation ) in domestic economic reform and the paralyzing effect of the eurozone crisis will lead to a massive shock . Remaining in a currency union with the much more competitive German economy will require wrenching and rapid reforms , for which Hollande's tepid approach will fail to prepare the complacent French . The result will be even more support than was seen in last April's presidential election for extremist political parties that reject both Europe and competitive market capitalism . </doc>

766,A14,"Identification of Prostate Cancer Stem Cells in Hormone Refractory Prostate Cancer ( HRPC ) Prostate Stem Cell Team Section : Section of Molecular Carcinogenesis The mainstay of treatment for prostate cancer that has failed radical local treatment is androgen deprivation therapy . This induces a remission in more than 90 % of advanced prostate cancer patients that lasts for a median of 18 months . With time , however , all patients relapse with hormone refractory disease with an overall median survival of 23-37 months . Our aim is to characterise stem cells within hormone refractory cancer and to determine differences between normal and cancer stem cells that may indicate potential therapeutic targets . We are collecting trans-rectal needle biopsies of the prostate from hormone refractory patients and deriving primary cultures from them . As for normal stem cells , CD133 can be used to isolate cancer stem cells and we are in the process of analysing differences in the gene expression profiles between HRPC stem cells and transit amplifying cells as well as between normal and cancer stem cells . We can then isolate stem cells for analysis and use the cultures and cell lines derived from them to screen for therapeutic targets and as testing tools for drug development . This project is being carried out in collaboration with Johann de Bono , Chris Parker and David Dearnaley in the Section of Medicine . </doc>

917,A4,""" I have found that holy place of rest Still changeless . "" – Mrs. Hemans – When Mr. Thornton had left the house that morning he was almost blinded by his baffled passion . He was as dizzy as if Margaret , instead of looking , and speaking , and moving like a tender graceful woman , had been a sturdy fish-wife , and given him a sound blow with her fists . He had positive bodily pain – a violent headache , and a throbbing intermittent pulse . He could not bear the noise , the garish light , the continued rumble and movement of the street . He called himself a fool for suffering so ; and yet he could not , at the moment , recollect the cause of his suffering , and whether it was adequate to the consequences it had produced . It would have been a relief to him , if he could have sat down and cried on a door-step by a little child , who was raging and storming , through his passionate tears , at some injury he had received . He said to himself , that he hated Margaret , but a wild , sharp sensation of love cleft his dull , thunderous feeling like lightning , even as he shaped the words expressive of hatred . His greatest comfort was in hugging his torment ; and in feeling , as he had indeed said to her , that though she might despise him , contemn him , treat him with her proud sovereign indifference , he did not change one whit . She could not make him change . He loved her , and would love her ; and defy her , and this miserable bodily pain . He stood still for a moment , to make this resolution firm and clear . There was an omnibus passing – going into the country ; the conductor thought he was wishing for a place , and stopped near the pavement . It was too much trouble to apologise and explain ; so he mounted upon it , and was borne away – past long rows of houses – then past detached villas with trim gardens , till they came to real country hedge-rows , and , by-and-by , to a small country town . Then every body got down ; and so did Mr. Thornton , and because they walked away he did so too . He went into the fields , walking briskly , because the sharp motion relieved his mind . He could remember all about it now ; the pitiful figure he must have cut ; the absurd way in which he had gone and done the very thing he had so often agreed with himself in thinking would be the most foolish thing in the world ; and had met with exactly the consequences which , in these wise moods , he had always fore-told were certain to follow , if he ever did make such a fool of himself . Was he bewitched by those beautiful eyes , that soft , half-open , sighing mouth which lay so close upon his shoulder only yesterday ? He could not even shake off the recollection that she had been there ; that her arms had been round him , once – if never again . He only caught glimpses of her ; he did not understand her altogether . At one time she was so brave , and at another so timid ; now so tender , and then so haughty and regal-proud . And then he thought over every time he had ever seen her once again , by way of finally forgetting her . He saw her in every dress , in every mood , and did not know which became her best . Even this morning , how magnificent she had looked – her eyes flashing out upon him at the idea that , because she had shared his danger yesterday , she had cared for him the least ! If Mr. Thornton was a fool in the morning , as he assured himself at least twenty times he was , he did not grow much wiser in the afternoon . All that he gained in return for his sixpenny omnibus ride , was a more vivid conviction that there never was , never could be , any one like Margaret ; that she did not love him and never would ; but that she – no ! nor the whole world – should never hinder him from loving her . And so he returned to the little market-place , and remounted the omnibus to return to Milton . It was late in the afternoon when he was set down , near his warehouse . The accustomed places brought back the accustomed habits and trains of thought . He knew how much he had to do – more than his usual work , owing to the commotion of the day before . He had to see his brother magistrates ; he had to complete the arrangements , only half made in the morning , for the comfort and safety of his newly imported Irish hands ; he had to secure them from all chance of communication with the discontented work-people of Milton . Last of all , he had to go home and encounter his mother . Mrs. Thornton had sat in the dining-room all day , every moment expecting the news of her son's acceptance by Miss Hale . She had braced herself up many and many a time , at some sudden noise in the house ; had caught up the half-dropped work , and begun to ply her needle diligently , though through dimmed spectacles , and with an unsteady hand ! and many times had the door opened , and some indifferent person entered on some insignificant errand . Then her rigid face unstiffened from its gray frost-bound expression , and the features dropped into the relaxed look of despondency , so unusual to their sternness . She wrenched herself away from the contemplation of all the dreary changes that would be brought about to herself by her son's marriage ; she forced her thoughts into the accustomed household grooves . The newly-married couple-to-be would need fresh household stocks of linen ; and Mrs. Thornton had clothes-basket upon clothes-basket , full of table-cloths and napkins , brought in , and began to reckon up the store . There was some confusion between what was hers , and consequently marked G H T ( for George and Hannah Thornton ) , and what was her son's – bought with his money , marked with his initials . Some of those marked G H T were Dutch damask of the old kind , exquisitely fine ; none were like them now . Mrs. Thornton stood looking at them long – they had been her pride when she was first married . Then she knit her brows , and pinched and compressed her lips tight , and carefully unpicked the G H. She went so far as to search for the Turkey-red marking-thread to put in the new initials ; but it was all used – and she had no heart to send for any more just yet . So she looked fixedly at vacancy ; a series of visions passing before her , in all of which her son was the principal , the sole object – her son , her pride , her property . Still he did not come . Doubtless he was with Miss Hale . The new love was displacing her already from her place as first in his heart . A terrible pain – a pang of vain jealousy – shot through her : she hardly knew whether it was more physical or mental ; but it forced her to sit down . In a moment , she was up again as straight as ever – a grim smile upon her face for the first time that day , ready for the door opening , and the rejoicing triumphant one , who should never know the sore regret his mother felt at his marriage . In all this , there was little thought enough of the future daughter-in-law as an individual . She was to be John's wife . To take Mrs. Thornton's place as mistress of the house , was only one of the rich consequences which decked out the supreme glory ; all household plenty and comfort , all purple and fine linen , honour , love , obedience , troops of friends , would all come as naturally as jewels on a king's robe , and be as little thought of for their separate value . To be chosen by John , would separate a kitchen-wench from the rest of the world . And Miss Hale was not so bad . If she had been a Milton lass , Mrs. Thornton would have positively liked her . She was pungent , and had taste , and spirit , and flavour in her . True , she was sadly prejudiced , and veryignorant ; but that was to be expected from her southern breeding . A strange sort of mortified comparison of Fanny with her , went on in Mrs. Thornton's mind ; and for once she spoke harshly to her daughter ; abused her roundly ; and then , as if by way of penance , she took up Henry's Commentaries , and tried to fix her attention on it , instead of pursuing the employment she took pride and pleasure in , and continuing her inspection of the table-linen . His step at last ! She heard him , even while she thought she was finishing a sentence ; while her eye did pass over it , and her memory could mechanically have repeated it word for word , she heard him come in at the hall-door . Her quickened sense could interpret every sound of motion : now he was at the hat-stand – now at the very room-door . Why did he pause ? Let her know the worst . Yet her head was down over the book ; she did not look up . He came close to the table , and stood still there , waiting till she should have finished the paragraph which apparently absorbed her . By an effort she looked up . "" Well , John ? "" He knew what that little speech meant . But he had steeled himself . He longed to reply with a jest ; the bitterness of his heart could have uttered one , but his mother deserved better of him . He came round behind her , so that she could not see his looks , and , bending back her gray , stony face , he kissed it , murmuring : "" No one loves me – no one cares for me , but you , mother . "" He turned away and stood leaning his head against the mantel-piece , tears forcing themselves into his manly eyes . She stood up – she tottered . For the first time in her life , the strong woman tottered . She put her hands on his shoulders ; she was a tall woman . She looked into his face ; she made him look at her . "" Mother's love is given by God , John . It holds fast for ever and ever . A girl's love is like a puff of smoke – it changes with every wind . And she would not have you , my own lad , would not she ? "" She set her teeth ; she showed them like a dog for the whole length of her mouth . He shook his head . "" I am not fit for her , mother ; I knew I was not . "" She ground out words between her closed teeth . He could not hear what she said ; but the look in her eyes interpreted it to be a curse – if not as coarsely worded , as fell in intent as ever was uttered . And yet her heart leapt up light , to know he was her own again . "" Mother ! "" said he , hurriedly , "" I can not hear a word against her . Spare me – spare me ! I am very weak in my sore heart ; – I love her yet ; I love her more than ever . "" "" And I hate her , "" said Mrs. Thornton , in a low fierce voice . "" I tried not to hate her , when she stood between you and me , because – I said to myself – she will make him happy ; and I would give my heart's blood to do that . But now , I hate her for your misery's sake . Yes , John , it 's no use hiding up your aching heart from me . I am the mother that bore you , and your sorrow is my agony ; and if you do n't hate her , I do . "" "" Then , mother , you make me love her more . She is unjustly treated by you , and I must make the balance even . But why do we talk of love or hatred ? She does not care for me , and that is enough – too much . Let us never name the subject again . It is the only thing you can do for me in the matter . Let us never name her . "" "" With all my heart . I only wish that she , and all belonging to her , were swept back to the place they came from . "" He stood still , gazing into the fire for a minute or two longer . Her dry dim eyes filled with unwonted tears as she looked at him ; but she seemed just as grim and quiet as usual when he next spoke . "" Warrants are out against three men for conspiracy , mother . The riot yesterday helped to knock up the strike . "" And Margaret's name was no more mentioned between Mrs. Thornton and her son . They fell back into their usual mode of talk – about facts , not opinions , far less feelings . Their voices and tones were calm and cold a stranger might have gone away and thought that he had never seen such frigid indifference of demeanour between such near relations . </doc>

1668,A16,"Tibbetts Brook , originally Tippett's Brook or Tibbitt's Brook , is a stream in the southern portion of mainland New York , flowing north to south from the city of Yonkers in Westchester County into the borough of the Bronx within New York City . Originally emptying into Spuyten Duyvil Creek as part of the Harlem River system , the stream is now partially subterranean , ending above ground at the south end of Van Cortlandt Lake within Van Cortlandt Park . There it proceeds into city sewers , draining into either the northern end of the Harlem River or the Wards Island Water Pollution Control Plant . The brook provides significant watershed to both Van Cortlandt Park at its south end and Tibbetts Brook Park at its north end . There have been modern proposals to daylight the southern portion of the brook back onto the surface . Contents Top : The original course of Spuyten Duyvil Creek and its junction with Tibbetts Brook , and the island of Paparinemo ( now Kingsbridge , Bronx ) Bottom : An 1895 map of Van Cortlandt Park , showing the course of Tibbetts Brook through the park lake , and its original crossing point with Broadway . Tibbetts Brook originates at H.F. Redmond Junior Memorial Park just north of Yonkers Avenue in Dunwoodie , Yonkers . It proceeds south through two artificial lakes in Tibbetts Brook Park , on a course parallel and adjacent to the Saw Mill River Parkway and the former New York and Putnam Railroad ( now a park trail ) . South of the park the brook runs in a channel directly adjacent to the northbound side of the parkway , then crosses the Yonkers / Bronx border into Van Cortlandt Park . It runs through the center of the Van Cortlandt Golf Course , then empties into Van Cortlandt Lake , an artificial lake created in 1699 by damming the stream . The brook currently ends at the south edge of the lake , at approximately West 242nd Street . Several storm drains feed excess rainwater into the brook within Yonkers . At the brook's mouth , the water from the brook proceeds into a brick sewer tunnel , which later merges with the major city sewer underneath Broadway that carries rainwater , household wastewater , and industrial sewage . The tunnel primarily drains into the Wards Island Water Pollution Control Plant where city sewage is treated . During rainy conditions the sewer overflows into the north end of the Harlem River , via a drain pipe at about West 192nd Street ( Heath Avenue ) . Due to modern development , the brook runs through underpasses and culverts at various points along its course . As recently as the early 20th Century , Tibbets Brook had two northern tributaries which merged at the north end of modern Tibbets Brook Park . The easternmost began in Redmond Park , while the western stream extended as far as Runyon Heights . The two streams originally merged at Peckham's Lake , later converging at the lakes of Tibbets Brook Park following the completion of the park . The Saw Mill Parkway was built over the western stream in the late 1920s . Until the end of the 19th century , the brook extended past the south end of Van Cortlandt Park . It ran southwest through the site of the current Van Cortlandt Stadium , crossed Broadway at around West 240th Street , then continued southwest through the Kingsbridge neighborhood , running a twisty course along the right-of-way of modern Tibbett Avenue . At approximately West 230th Street , just north of the current site of John F. Kennedy High School , the brook drained into Spuyten Duyvil Creek , which at the time separated the Bronx from Marble Hill , Manhattan . Until the 1700s , Tibbets Brook split into two smaller streams at around West 237th Street , the westernmost and primary stream along modern Tibbett Avenue feeding into the Spuyten Duyvil , and the easternmost along the right-of-ways of the Putnam Railroad and current Major Deegan Expressway feeding into the Harlem River . The two streams formed a triangular island called Paparinemo that constitutes much of today's Kingsbridge neighborhood . The brook had numerous tributaries , including several within modern Van Cortlandt Park . The north end of the brook within Yonkers and the park is entirely fresh water , while south of the park it was a tidal estuary lined with salt marshes . The watershed from the brook created wetlands surrounding the stream , and formed a northern extension of the Harlem River valley . The original Spuyten Duyvil Creek course has since been filled in , replaced by the Harlem River Ship Canal . An 1867 map of Yonkers and Western Bronx , showing the course of Tibbetts Brook ( in red ) prior to modern development . Tibbetts Brook was originally referred to as Mosholu by local Lenape Native Americans , an Algonquin word meaning "" smooth stones "" or "" small stones "" . The Mosholu name was later given to Mosholu Parkway . The label Tibbetts Brook was applied by European settlers , named after George Tippett who held property between the Hudson River and Bronx River in the late 17th Century , with the brook running through the center . Although often considered a corruption of the name Tippett , the label may be a combination of the name of Tippett and that of his father-in-law William Betts , who owned the land along with him . The brook has also been referred to as the Yonkers River or Yonkers Creek in the past , previously written as Jonckers or Uncas . During at least three glacial periods , including the Wisconsin glaciation around 20,000 years ago , ice sheets advanced south across North America carving moraines , valleys , and hills across present-day Bronx and Westchester . As the glacial ice melted , rivers and creeks were formed within valleys , including Tibbetts Brook . Prior to European colonization , the local Lenape population utilized the brook for drinking water and fishing . Trout swam up the Harlem River in order to use the freshwater portion of the brook as a spawning site . The salt marshes along the stream housed fish and migratory birds , along with mussels , oysters , and crabs . In the 1690s , Jacobus Van Cortlandt acquired property near Tibbetts Brook from his relative Frederick Philipse , located in modern Van Cortlandt Park . This area was called "" George's Point "" , where the brook turned west towards Broadway . In 1699 , Van Cortlandt dammed the stream in order to power a gristmill and sawmill , creating Van Cortlandt Lake as a mill pond in the process . By the 19th Century , the eastern stream was filled in , connecting Kingsbridge to the rest of the Bronx . From 1872 to 1880 , the New York and Putnam Railroad was built along the Tibbetts Brook valley . The construction of the railroad altered the natural drainage pattern of the brook , leading new marshes to develop around it . In 1888 , the New York City Parks Department acquired the land to create Van Cortlandt Park . The Parks Department began draining the brook wetlands for recreational areas , creating the park's parade ground in 1888 and the Van Cortlandt Golf Course in 1895 . The lake flows south into a drain pipe to the Broadway sewer Between the late 1890s and the early 1910s , around the time the original course of Spuyten Duyvil Creek was filled in and replaced by the Harlem River Ship Canal , the double-arched Broadway sewer was constructed , as was the tunnel at the south end of Van Cortlandt Lake to funnel water from the brook into the sewer . The marshlands created by the brook and lake had drawn the ire of local residents and property owners , who believed them to be "" unsightly and unsanitary "" . Of particular concern was the threat of the wetlands serving as breeding grounds for malaria - borne mosquitoes . The Broadway Outlet Sewer was completed in 1907 . In conjunction with the sewer project , from 1903 to 1911 the Parks Department completed a cleaning and improvement project for the Van Cortlandt Lake . This involved removing the original earthen dam and emptying the lake in order to dredge the lake bed to a lower depth . A new dam was installed to reform the lake . The drain pipe between the lake and Broadway sewer was constructed from 1911 to 1912 . It was originally envisioned as cast-iron , but built using brick . Around this time , Tibbett Avenue was laid out and opened , while much of the marshland within the park and along the former river course was filled in . On June 25 , 1927 , Westchester County opened Tibbetts Brook Park near the northern end of the brook , on land previously confiscated from the Tippett estate . Much of the site had been a Yonkers city garbage dump located on the banks of the western brook tributary . The garbage and residential sewage seeped into the stream , which fed polluted water into Peckham's Lake . The lake had been used by residents as a swimming hole in spite of recommendations against it by health officials . The area immediately south of the lake had been a swamp which was a haven for mosquitoes . As part of the creation of the park , the original lake was filled in , while the swamp was dredged to form the current Tibbetts Lake . The brook , meanwhile , was diverted into a paved channel . The eastern tributary had been protected by fences and infrastructure from the nearby Old Croton Aqueduct . At the time the park was constructed , the southern portion of the Saw Mill River Parkway was built on top of the dump along the western tributary course . Between the 1930s and 1960s under the supervision of Robert Moses , several highways including the Henry Hudson , Saw Mill and Mosholu Parkways were constructed within Van Cortlandt Park , requiring Tibbetts Brook to be diverted into culverts under the roadways . The creation of the sewer at the south end of Van Cortlandt Lake and the construction of the highways induced siltation of the stream , leading to further creation of marshes . In addition , pollution from upstream and the highways , and spillover of chemicals used in the golf course led to the death of fish inhabiting the lake . In 1978 , the fish population of the lake was restored . In 1979 , four storm sewers along Midland Avenue in Yonkers ( which forms the eastern boundary of Tibbetts Brook Park ) were found to be illegally connected to the brook , pumping raw sewage into it which proceeded to enter Van Cortlandt Lake downstream . That year , another storm drain located at approximately Lawton Street and McLean Avenue near the Saw Mill Parkway , 1,300 feet ( 400 m ) north of the Yonkers / Bronx border , was found to be leaking household sewage into the brook . In 1984 , sewage from Yonkers was again found to be contaminating Van Cortlandt Lake , due to the crossing of raw sewage pipes and storm sewers which feed into Tibbetts Brook . This included water from the Lawton Street drain pipe . The same sewage pipe was found to be the cause of pollution of the lake in 2016 . In the 21st century , it has been proposed to daylight the southern portion of Tibbetts Brook back onto the surface , and to restore and defragment the portions of the stream within Van Cortlandt Park . Proposals to daylight the stream have existed since the 1990s . Around 4,000,000 to 5,000,000 US gallons ( 15 , 000 , 000 to 19,000,000 l ; 3,300,000 to 4,200,000 imp gal ) of fresh water from the brook enter the sewer system on a daily basis , a total of 2,000,000,000 US gallons ( 7 . 6 × 10 9 l ; 1.7 × 10 9 imp gal ) annually . The additional water from the brook also contributes to the further overflowing of raw sewage into the Harlem River during rainy conditions . Meanwhile , the lack of natural drainage points within Van Cortlandt Park leads to the flooding of recreational areas within the park . The New York City Parks Department plans to daylight the brook as part of their "" Van Cortlandt Park Master Plan : 2030 "" . The plan also proposes further dredging the lake and stream within the park , and rerouting the stream away from the highways and pedestrian paths to minimize the use of culverts , as well as restoring the natural wetlands created by the brook . The primary route proposed for bringing the brook above ground is the former Putnam Railroad right-of-way , which is currently owned by CSX Transportation but is largely abandoned between the park and the Harlem River . This portion of the Putnam Railroad is directly adjacent to the southbound lanes of the Major Deegan Expressway . The routing would provide a more natural drainage path for the brook into the Harlem River , with none of the water entering the sewer system on a normal basis . ^ Cook , Lyman ( September 5 , 1820 ) .

1562,A7,"Prospecting for Life Insurance Clients in the 21st Century Internet Leads vs Direct Fifty years ago the world was "" larger , "" the pace of daily life slower , and the competition for insurance within any single community much less intense than it is today . Today it is almost impossible to knock on a door , unexpected , and find a receptive audience . The previous generation of insurance agents was able to prepare an audience with the use of mass market mail campaigns followed up by phone calls and then a visit . sign up for internet insurance leads "" Mass marketing , however , has been intensely overplayed ; many people – too busy to read the many brochures , catalogs , and solicitations that arrive in their mail boxes – simply sort the "" junk "" from the bills and then pile the junk mail off to the side where it accumulates until finally it is tossed in the trash . Only a tiny percentage of mass market mail is read . In fact , one of the managers at a local recycling center reports that tons of "" garbage "" sorted at the facility is junk mail – much of which has never even been opened ! Many insurance companies try to "" incentify "" people into responding to a mailer by promising something free if they return the postage paid card . Often the "" freebie "" is a booklet promising information – such as a buyers guide for life insurance , a booklet explaining Medicare and so forth . Believing that they will just get a free booklet in the mail , individuals write their names on such cards and drop them in the mailbox . In spite of the fact that the "" small print "" explains that the card is a solicitation for some product , and that an agent will call , individuals are often irritated when an agent calls and asks to "" deliver "" the requested information . This strategy is old and outdated . Furthermore , those who sent in the card thinking they would get something for free are often not financially qualified to purchase anything . Is there still a place for mail campaigns ? Absolutely . However , mail campaigns are more likely to be effective when the recipients are "" targeted , "" not just by age and generic interest , but when they are targeted specifically by the agent whose name they are likely to recognize on the envelope . For example , if you have been the guest speaker for a group of retirees at a local church or civic club , a follow up mailer might be opened , and if the individual recalls that your service might benefit him , he might be receptive to an appointment when you call . Do n't wait by the phone , however – he usually wo n't call you first . Another positive use of a mail campaign is to your book of existing clients . These folks have already trusted you with their money . They will recognize your name and , if you send them something in a personal envelope – rather than a pre-addressed company one – they will definitely open it . Furthermore , since insurance agents are often "" recycled "" faster than fast-food restaurant employees , your people will appreciate knowing that you are still around . You should send a card , a "" personal "" letter or a newsletter created by you at least once a quarter . If you can do it monthly , that 's even better . You may think that since the client already has your information , it 's unlikely that you will gain any new business , but you could not be more mistaken . Experienced agents know that the larger policies – such as annuities and large life insurance or long term care policies – are often purchased by clients who already know you . Furthermore , "" stuff "" happens . A family member dies who did n't have insurance . Health insurance policies held by employers get cancelled . People retire and have to roll their money out of the company . A simple reminder that you are still available along with a convenient list of products you have will bring your name to the forefront when a life changing event takes place . For obtaining new clients , however , "" cold call "" mail campaigns are a huge waste of your money . Today's insurance agents must face the fact that the world and the business has been dramatically changed by technology . It 's a fact that the world is less friendly , people less patient with lengthy presentations and more likely to switch from one company to another in search of the best deal . You ca n't succeed with mail campaigns , cold calls , and door knocking . You also ca n't fight the impact of technology . The only way to cope is to make the technology work for you . Participation in an internet lead generation program is regarded by many agents and brokers as the most effective way to locate new , and interested prospects . Life changing events – a death in the family , a marriage , or a birth of new baby motivate people to search for a product . They want quotes and comparisons quickly , preferably without having to talk to anyone , even though most will work with an agent once they have made a company or product selection . Like insurance companies , lead generation companies are not all created equal . A good lead generation company will : deliver real time leads within minutes of receiving them deliver leads that have been generated from their own sites – not recycled or purchased from "" dump "" sites provide filters so you receive leads only from prospects you would be able to serve Purchasing leads via the internet is only the first step in a successful use of technology . Agents and brokers also need their own websites where they can describe their services , provide information on changes in the insurance industry , and perhaps even maintain a blog or guestbook where clients can communicate with each other and with their agents . When we have done a job a certain way for a long time , it is difficult to change . However , the bottom line in the insurance industry is that agents must meet clients where the clients are , and today , that is "" online . "" </doc>

( 5 ) The interest under paragraph ( 4 ) shall be payable from the date which is one month from the date of service of the demand under paragraph ( 1 ) to the date of payment at such rate as , by virtue of a determination of the Department of Finance under section 5 of the Public Health and Local Government ( Miscellaneous Provisions ) Act ( Northern Ireland ) 1962 M17 , is , on the date on which the said demand is served , in force for the purposes of expenses to which subsection ( 1 ) ( b ) of that section applies . ( 6 ) Subject to paragraph ( 7 ) , if a person from whom a sum is recoverable in accordance with this Article proves that he -- ( a ) is liable only by reason of the fact that he is an agent or trustee for some other person ; and ( b ) has not , and since the date on which he became liable has not had , in his hands on behalf of that other person sufficient money to discharge the whole demand of the Department ; his liability shall be limited to the total amount of the money which he has , or since the said date has had , in his hands as aforesaid ; but where the Department is or would be debarred by the foregoing provisions from recovering the whole of any such sum from an agent or trustee , it may recover the whole or any unpaid balance thereof from the person for whom he is agent or trustee .

( 8 ) The time within which summary proceedings may be taken for the recovery of any sum , which the Department is entitled to recover under this Order , shall be reckoned from the date of the service of a demand therefor ; but where the sum is recoverable in a case in which an appeal has been made under Article 16 , the said time shall be reckoned from the date on which the appeal is finally determined or abandoned as the case may be . ( 9 ) Any proceedings commenced under paragraph ( 4 ) for the recovery of a sum specified in a demand served under paragraph ( 1 ) shall , on the service on the Department of notice of an appeal under Article 16 against that demand , be stayed until the appeal is finally determined or abandoned . ( 10 ) Subject to paragraphs ( 11 ) and ( 12 ) , any expenses recoverable in respect of any frontage by the Department in accordance with this Article shall , until recovered , be deemed to be charged on and payable out of the estate , in the premises having that frontage , of -- ( a ) the responsible person or other person liable under this Order for those expenses ; and ( b ) any person deriving title from him ; so however that , where a person is the responsible person or the person otherwise liable as aforesaid by reason of the fact that he is an agent or trustee for another person , those expenses shall be a charge on the estate in the premises of the person for whom he is agent or trustee . ( 11 ) Subject to paragraph ( 12 ) , the charge created by paragraph ( 10 ) shall be enforceable in all respects as if it were a valid mortgage by deed created in favour of the Department by the person on whose estate that charge has been created ( with , where necessary , any concurrence or consent required by law ) for the amount of the expenses referred to in that paragraph on -- ( a ) the date of the undertaking under Article 24 ( 1 ) or , as the case may be , of the undertaking under Article 24 ( 2 ) or of the agreement under Article 32 ; and ( b ) in every other case , the date of the completion of the street works ; and for the recovery thereof the Department may exercise the powers conferred by sections 19 , 21 and 22 of the Conveyancing Act 1881 M18 on mortgages by deed .

Could n't find a single flaw in this hotel . Absolutely recommend it to anyone . The service was really kind , everything was clean and the food was also great ! There is no place for disappointment here ! Would visit again . This is one of the best hotels we have ever stayed in . The room was large , stylish and beautifully furnished ; we were treated like royalty at breakfast , the service were impeccable ; a wonderful location and the well appointed bar encouraged us to stay in hotel . This hotel certainly has the formula right . A huge rush to return to our London home - Hotel 41 - as we prepared for our granddaughter's christening . Our son flew in from his home abroad and we were reunited in the Executive Lounge , where the team discreetly poured champagne as we happily embraced . We spent the day catching up with family matters and relaxed royally in the ... More Creature comforts galore-hot water bottle in your turned down bed , candle lit in bathroom , perfect pillows , sheets and duvets , saran wrapped remote controls , clean relaxing room , plenty of product , beautiful lounge for guests of "" 41 "" only . Lounge is stunning , quiet , with nice wines , liquors and munchies if you 're hungry . Staff ca n't do enough for you from start to finish and ... More We stayed in the 41 Hotel seven nights in August . The experience was excellent . The hotel's location was ideal for us with easy access to the tube and easy walking distance to restaurants and shopping . The staff and their overall service was wonderful .

More Staying in Westminster Neighbourhood Profile Westminster If you only had an afternoon to experience London on a grand scale , Westminster would be a wise place to start . The ornate Houses of Parliament and Westminster Abbey sit adjacent at a corner of Parliament Square , and a short stroll along The Mall leads to Buckingham Palace . Trafalgar Square and Nelson's Column are just up the road as well . As captivating as the architecture is , the wonders of Mother Nature are highlights of the area too . St James's Park ( arguably London's loveliest ) , the expansive Green Park , and pedestrian friendly tree lined paths along the river showcase the exquisite manicure provided by English gardeners . Just beyond the landmarks and the gorgeous outdoor spaces , quiet residential squares and age old local pubs offer a more subdued take on this global seat of power in the heart of London .

Keywords : Boltzmann equation , Electron distribution , Transport coeffcients , Physics laser , Plasma physics , Gas discharges , Kinetic model . Classification : 19.8 , 19.11 . Nature of problem : ELENDIF calculates the time evolution of the electron energy distribution function in a mixture of partially ionized gases with or without an applied electric field . The code can treat inelastic and superelastic processes , electron-electron and electron-ion collisions , photon-electron ( free-free ) processes , attachment and recombination , ionization including a distribution of secondary electrons , and an external source of electrons ( e.g. an electron beam ) . The code also computes the mean electron energy , drift velocity , diffusion coefficient , rate coefficients and energy flow rates for the processes being included in the calculation . Solution method : ELENDIF solves the time-dependent Boltzmann transport equation in terms of the electron number density . By finite-differencing the electron energy axis , the Boltzmann equation is transformed into a finite set of coupled differential equations for the electron number density at each energy grid as a function of time . The matrix of densities is then evolved forward in time using a combination of explicit and implicit methods . The electron energy distribution is then convolved with the cross section to provide the transport coefficients , collisional rates and energy flow rates . Restrictions : It is assumed in the formulation of ELENDIF that the two-term spherical harmonic expansion of the electron distribution function is adequate . Running time : On the Vax 8650 the code takes 0.11 seconds per timestep if the effects of electron-electron collisions are ignored , and 0.46 seconds per timestep if electron-electron collisions are included . </doc>

1118,A17,"The Engadget Score is a unique ranking of products based on extensive independent research and analysis by our expert editorial and research teams . The Global Score is arrived at only after curating hundreds , sometimes thousands of weighted data points ( such as critic and user reviews ) . Less for drone lovers , more for outdoor moviemakers . Karma Get more info Engadget Critic Users When Karma was unveiled last month , there were two main takeaways . First was the lack of much-expected "" follow me "" features ; second was the inclusion of a ( not-expected ) hand-held stabilizer , turning Karma into a "" kit . "" GoPro CEO Nick Woodman would declare Karma to be "" much more than a drone , "" pitching it as a complete video-stabilization system -- one that can be worn , held and flown . The big question was , would that be enough for buyers to overlook what appeared to be a pared feature set on the drone itself ? Gallery : GoPro Karma review | 26 Photos Engadget Score Poor Uninspiring Good Excellent Key Pros Direct control of GoPro camera in flight and with the stabilizer The stabilizer is also compatible with GoPro accessories Cons No obstacle avoidance No follow me mode or other smart features No downward positioning sensor Modest battery life Summary As a drone on its own , GoPro's Karma lacks a lot of features offered on rival devices , while the battery life is toward the low-end of acceptable . The big appeal here is the ease of use and overall versatility . If you 're invested in the GoPro ecosystem , Karma makes a lot of sense . More serious drone enthusiasts will want to look elsewhere . At $ 799 ( if you "" bring your own camera "" ) , and $ 999 / $ 1 , 099 if you want to include a Hero5 Session or Black , Karma is priced aggressively , undercutting DJI's Phantom 4 if you factor in the cost of the hand-held stabilizer ( DJI's cheapest equivalent costs an extra $ 300 ) . But then DJI revealed the Mavic Pro and set fire to GoPro's plans . It 's smaller , similarly priced and bests GoPro across the spec sheet . The question now is : Will GoPro's claim of being more than a drone be enough to lure casual filmmakers away from DJI's technologically superior product ? Hardware What comes in the box depends on whether you need a GoPro . If you 're buying a bundle that includes a Hero5 camera , you 'll save $ 100 versus buying it and the Karma individually , which is n't bad . All the bundles come with the following : a Karma drone , six propellers , a touchscreen controller , the hand-held "" Grip "" stabilizer ( also called a "" gimbal "" ) and a backpack to hold it all . There 's also a charger with connectors for the batteries as well as USB Type-C , so you can simultaneously recharge the drone and the controller or Grip ( or anything else powered by USB-C ) . Karma's party trick is the removable gimbal , which you can swap from the drone into the Grip for smooth videos shot both in the sky and on the ground . There 's also a clip that makes the Grip compatible with existing GoPro mounts . Therefore , if you have a selfie stick or a helmet mount for your camera , it 's theoretically compatible with the Karma Grip , which means you can stabilize your GoPro almost anywhere you can mount it ( almost ) . It wo n't make sense to attach the Grip to everything -- a headband mount would have it in your face , for example -- but there are many creative ways to add it to your workflow and achieve interesting , stabilized video that previously was n't possible . While the drone is probably what you 're buying Karma for , the Grip adds a huge amount of functionality . And while the drone is where all the fun is , there 's a good chance you might end up using the Grip more . GoPro refers to Karma as a "" stabilization system . "" It 's easy to see this as the company positioning Karma as a camera product , as opposed to a drone competing directly with the Phantom 4 or Mavic . I 'll revisit this point later on , but for now keep that thought in mind . As quadcopters go , Karma is not bad-looking . Folding arms and collapsible landing gear mean Karma packs down to a very low profile . Much lower than any Phantom , certainly , though Karma is considerably longer and wider than Mavic . Unfolding Karma takes seconds , and folding it back down is weirdly satisfying in the way it all neatly clicks together . Karma's body is mostly made of glossy white plastic , with a contrasting gray underbelly and a gray soft-touch section on top that complements the shiny lid . Whether you think it 's better-looking than the Smurfy white curves of the Phantom or the masculine Mavic will be a matter of personal taste . Karma's controller looks and feels like a gadget in its own right . GoPro built in a 5-inch , 900-nit 720p display , which is kept safe from the elements by a clamshell design . Unlike many RC controllers ( aka transmitters ) that have metal knurled "" sticks , "" Karma's has smooth sticks with a rubberized finish . The controller is weighty but comfortable to hold , and the lack of external antennas make it feel infinitely less geeky than a regular transmitter . The Grip has a similar aesthetic as the controller , with a gunmetal color and flush buttons . Unlike most other hand-held GoPro stabilizers , it features buttons that control the camera directly . There are buttons to turn the camera on and off , set highlight tags , start and stop recording , and change modes , as well as set the camera's angle in the grip ( you can also do this manually ) . No need to touch the GoPro at all . Overall , everything is well-made and carefully engineered . For example , the drone batteries have a spring-loaded handle on the rear that satisfyingly extends as you pull the battery out , and neatly tucks itself away as you slide it back in . Similarly , if you charge the Grip with the camera in it , you 'll charge both at the same time . Even the backpack has a few thoughtful details , such as a GoPro quick-release mount on the strap for mounting the Grip on ( with the aforementioned adaptor ) . You need to keep the straps tight to stop it from flopping about , but it 's a nice touch . Karma drone's battery life is estimated at 20 minutes . In practice , it 's somewhere around 17 minutes , depending on how you fly . Drone battery life is always something of a guessing game . DJI , for example , claims Mavic's battery lasts 27 minutes , but in my experience , I never got much more than 20 minutes of flight time with it . That 's better , of course , but still less than advertised . In short , you 'll likely want extra batteries , which cost $ 99 a pop . That 's not chump change , but it 's on par with or even cheaper than the competition ( Mavic / Phantom batteries cost $ 89 and $ 169 , respectively ) . So let 's quickly talk about what the Karma drone does not have . The most obvious omission is any sort of "" follow me "" feature , given GoPro's association with self-filming . The basic tools are there -- GPS in the drone and the controller -- but GoPro claims current technology does n't provide a good enough experience . I 've tried GPS-based solutions , and they 're prone to jerky motion , as the drone keeps calculating your location . Camera-based object tracking helps eliminate that , but as anyone with a smartphone with facial recognition knows , it 's prone to losing its target . There 's also a simpler argument as to why it was left out : It 's not that useful for most people . Also , it requires obstacle avoidance to be safe -- another feature Karma lacks . Karma also does n't have downward sensors for helping it keep position , especially indoors ( though you can still fly inside ) . Downward-facing sensors have been around for years -- the original Parrot AR Drone had one back in 2010 . Even DJI would n't introduce indoor positioning to the Phantom until as recently as last year , but these days it 's a feature most people expect on a drone at this price , and it 's not here . It 's not just for indoors ; it helps keep the drone steady outside too . GoPro's outdoorsy crowd might not miss indoor flying so much , but the extra stability would be nice . Obstacle avoidance , however , is a newer technology , with the Phantom 4 being the first from DJI's popular line to support it , and that only came out back in March ( about six months before Karma ) . If GoPro had released Karma around the same time as the Phantom 4 as originally planned , the lack of these sensors would n't have seemed so obvious , but ultimately it did n't , and here we are . It 's worth remembering that most drones , including Mavic and the Phantom 4 , "" only "" have forward-facing obstacle avoidance -- which is better than none , of course -- but there are still three directions you can crash them from . Similarly , the Phantom did n't get basic follow features until a retroactive update for Phantom 3 at the end of last year . Either way , to GoPro's detriment , six months is a long time in drone land , and Karma's delay has accentuated its shortcomings . Getting started So what is Karma like to use ? Let's start with the controller , as that will likely be your first interaction with it . The first time you turn it on -- it takes about 30 seconds to boot -- you 'll see some basic setup screens . I connected the controller to my home's WiFi network ( for updates and downloading maps , etc. ) and was soon given the option to learn to fly with the built-in simulator . If you 've never flown before , this is a good way to have a few test runs or sharpen your skills between flights . The central power , start and land buttons are reachable with your thumbs , while the shoulder buttons for camera tilt , recording and mode selection / highlight tagging are all easy to access . Typical drone controllers are covered with buttons . DJI's are n't too bad , but others ( like Yuneec's ) are littered with knobs , switches and dials that can be daunting to new pilots ( not to mention , easy to press accidentally ) . Karma's controller is refreshingly clean and simple , although it does mean fewer dedicated buttons . The 5-inch screen is bright and clearly visible in direct sunlight . Though some controllers use your phone as a display ( like the Phantom or the Mavic ) , I prefer not having to use a phone , at least not for basic flying . First of all , it always feels a bit kludgy . Then , ironically , you have to put your phone in airplane mode or risk receiving calls or alerts while you 're piloting . Plus , it 's just one more drain on your phone battery . I always found the controller for the Phantom 3 and 4 unwieldy , what with the phone balanced on top in a clip . The Mavic controller sandwiches the phone between two grips at the bottom , which is a better design but does n't look very elegant . Both scenarios also add to the setup process , as you have to make sure the USB port or WiFi is connected and the phone is securely in place ( do n't forget to tap to focus , guys ) . With Karma's controller , you just switch it on and you 're set . Much like the physical controls , Karma's on-screen menus are simple and sparse . All the important info is on screen , though . Remaining flight time is shown via a big bar along the top that changes from green to red as it depletes ( sadly , all too quickly ) . On the right-hand side are distance and height . Along the bottom , easily identifiable icons point you toward in-flight settings , camera modes and auto-shot paths . Ready for takeoff We 've come all this way , and we have n't even taken off yet . Let 's do that . Getting in the air is pretty simple . Karma will tell you when it 's ready to fly ( literally -- it has voice alerts ) . From there , hold the start button for a count of three . Then you can either tap the big on-screen "" launch "" button and Karma will take off by itself , or manually push upward on the left stick . By default , Karma will have "" Easy "" mode activated . This limits how high and far you can fly , and also reduces its speed to help prevent over-ambitious maiden flights . Flying in Easy mode can still feel fairly quick , so you 'd be smart to stick with that setting if you 're just starting out . Once you 're feeling braver , you can turn off Easy mode . With a top speed of 35 mph , Karma is no slouch . Again , the Mavic bests it with a top speed of 40 mph , but that 's not a huge difference , and requires being in "" Sport "" mode , which disables the obstacle avoidance . For most people , then , Karma will feel plenty fast . Thanks to the lack of downward sensors , even with GPS connected , Karma can gently drift when you let go of the controls ( anyone who 's owned a Phantom 2 will be familiar with this ) . The Mavic , meanwhile , holds its position in the air with almost freakish accuracy . Karma only wanders a foot or two when hovering and you 'll quickly learn to make micro-adjustments if needed . Even so , you should stick to wide open spaces at the beginning . Once you 're moving , Karma feels nimble yet steady . The 720p video feed to the controller had the occasional glitch on screen , but no more than I 've seen with other video links , including DJI . Importantly , there were no freezes , or worse , complete losses of connection , even when flying far away . The uncluttered display is much appreciated when lining up your shots . Both DJI and Yuneec cram all sorts of data onto the screen , and much of it feels unnecessary ( motor-rotation speed ? ) , at least as a permanent fixture on the main screen . Video and photo modes Karma has four auto-shot modes that help you get pro-style clips without having to be a flying master . Again , most or even all of these are common on other camera-enabled drones , but given that GoPro is pitching Karma at outdoor amateur videographers , they 're especially important . We only have ourselves to blame for the drone selfie mode , or "" Dronie . "" Fly Karma to a starting point , and Karma will slowly , steadily fly backward and upward until you 're barely a dot on the screen . It works well enough , but I 'm not sure how many times I would use it in my own videos . Your level of proclivity for selfies may differ from mine . "" Cable cam "" is much more useful , making Karma move between two locations as if on a cable . The start and end points can be at different heights , and you can rotate Karma or change speed while it 's moving , which can lead to some great-looking panning shots . I tried this on an empty beach , and it 's perfect for complex shots , revealing different parts of the landscape over time ( and in three dimensions ) . "" Orbit , "" as the name suggests , has the Karma fly around a central point . Again , you can change the height and the camera angle as it goes , so you can get creative . This is one of my favorite moves , but it 's also hard to avoid catching yourself in shot , which is n't always what you want . Also , having tried Mavic's equivalent mode that can circle a moving target ( which is perilous if there are trees or cables around , but very cool ) . I wish Karma could also do this . Lastly , "" Reveal "" flies between two points starting with the camera facing directly down , slowly panning it upward for the big , well , "" reveal . "" It 's another staple shot that 's great for intros . I also found that by lowering the camera tilt speed in settings , I could achieve pretty good "" reveals "" manually -- a trick I found myself using more often . Now is probably a good time to remind you of the Hero5's "" Linear "" mode . It 's a setting that removes the fish-eye effect common to GoPros . At least know if you 're using Karma with a Hero5 , Linear mode does away with this effect ( the trade-off being that you ca n't use Linear mode in 4K -- only 2 . 7K and below ) . Changing the camera modes from the controller can be done via the onscreen menu , or the "" Highlight "" shoulder button ( when not recording ) . When recording , the display shows how much recording time has elapsed . Occasionally this number froze , and tapping the record button would n't kick it back into gear . On landing , the camera was still recording , so no footage was lost . Still : frustrating . You can actually view all your recorded media via the controller at any time , though , and it works surprisingly fast . A feature that got lost in the official announcement was the companion "" Passenger "" mobile app . With Passenger , you hand over the control of the camera to someone else via his or her phone . It 's simple to set up -- just connect the phone to the controller's WiFi hotspot , grant it access and you 're good . I only got it working on iOS , though , as my Pixel could n't see the WiFi hotspot at all . I asked GoPro about this and was told that Android 7.1 is still in testing . What 's more exciting about Passenger is the potential it adds . Earlier I talked about the drawbacks of using a phone for controlling a drone . That 's still true when it 's required , but as an optional add-on , it can be useful . With Passenger , it could be a direct way to add livestreaming to Facebook or YouTube . More than a drone There 's no denying Karma does n't have the extensive feature set of other drones . But what happens when the battery runs out ? With most quadcopters , you either charge a battery , swap in a spare or maybe go sit down somewhere . With Karma , you can do all of those , or carry on filming with the hand-held grip . You can buy a separate hand-held stabilizer to go with your existing drone , but most good ones cost around $ 300 . ( The video below was shot using a mix of the drone and the Grip . ) Karma's Grip is likely the main thing that will separate people into team GoPro or team DJI ; it 's a solid value-add if you 're in the GoPro ecosystem . Even before Karma , a hand-held gimbal is the first accessory I 'd recommend . They are the single biggest upgrade you can give your GoPro videos . As with the drone you can also control the camera directly from the Grip ( others you need to touch the camera ) . The Grip also charges your camera while you use it , and has a battery life of around two hours . While it 's a good all-rounder , it lacks a joystick for manual camera movement . Grip is also rugged . It 's not waterproof , but it 's at least "" weatherproof . "" The option to attach it to existing GoPro accessories adds almost unlimited potential . I 'm interested to see who comes up with the wildest use for it , but imagine silky smooth video from the cockpit of a toboggan , or from the mudguard of a dirt bike . These are all things you can do with Karma that you ca n't with a drone . Portability During Karma's launch , much was made about how portable the kit was , thanks to the included backpack . It 's comfortable to wear , and at around 8 pounds , it 's not that heavy . But it 's not exactly compact , either . Or at least , it 's not compared to the much smaller Mavic . When it was a toss-up between the Phantom 4 and the Karma , GoPro's slimline offering was easily a more manageable choice ( at least in terms of size ) . I 've had the pleasure of lugging a Phantom across the Pacific , so I can say from experience that it 's doable , but not fun . Wrapup If you 're interested in drones and looking for a smart flying robot that also shoots video , it 's hard to recommend Karma over Mavic . But enthusiasts who are only looking for a drone already knew that and did n't need to read this review . If you 've gotten this far , it 's possible you 're into making videos , enjoy outdoors adventure or part of the big old "" everyone else "" and are n't sure which makes most sense for you . GoPro's Karma is simpler , easy to use and has a singular focus on video . Mavic is gadgety and full of advanced features -- kind of like a gaming PC when you might just want to browse the internet . The flight range of 4.3 miles ( compared to Karma's 1.8 ) is reassuring , but does it affect real-world flying ? Most aviation authorities , including the FAA , require recreational users keep a visual line of sight when flying a drone -- and both Karma and Mavic can fly beyond that without the video link dropping . Do you need to whiz around a bit faster ? It 's fun , but so is recording smooth video on your mountain bike . It 's harder to argue against more practical differences like battery life . GoPro's is n't bad -- it 's just OK . Similarly , obstacle avoidance is n't a neat trick ; it can save your drone and prevent accidents . Unlike "" follow me "" features ( or lack thereof , in Karma's case ) that will bum a few people out , but it still feels like something people expected , but did n't necessarily need . But then there 's the basic practicality that Karma is fun to fly , flies well , has great auto-shot modes and the versatility of the hand-held gimbal . As for your wallet , Karma is a decent deal -- a drone , a camera and a hand-held stabilizer for the price of a Mavic . DJI will sell you a Mavic without a controller for $ 50 less than the Karma ( without a camera ) , but you have to be willing to trade a lot of usability for that saving , and of course , still no hand-held . It 's a much more limited proposition for enthusiastic video makers , albeit a better one for budding pilots . Let's not forget , Karma is still a decent consumer drone . There are just better ones available . But if your focus is video , Karma has much more to offer . Originally from Bristol , UK , and currently based in Spain , James began writing for music magazines in the '90s . After a few failed attempts at a DJ career , he 'd carve out a living reviewing DJ and music production gear . Now , it 's more about drones , fitness tech , and culture . Though he keeps his DJ gear plugged in and on show . You never know . </doc>

260,A16,"Web Journal of Current Legal Issues in association with Blackstone Press Ltd Bruce Grant and Mike Allen , University of Newcastle upon Tyne http://webjcli.ncl.ac.uk / The Web Journal of Current Legal Issues is the first United Kingdom general law journal to be published purely electronically using World Wide Web . The journal is refereed and published bi-monthly . The first issue was mounted on the Web on 17 March 1995 and the second issue will be mounted in mid-May . Notes for Contributors may be obtained directly from the journal site or from Mike Allen at Newcastle Law School . The journal is the brainchild of Mike Allen and Bruce Grant of Newcastle Law School , at the University of Newcastle upon Tyne . Mike is the journal's editor and drew together a strong Editorial Board of fourteen members from a number of law schools around the country comprising a Committee of seven members responsible for the editing of the journal supported by seven advisory members . Refereed electronic journals have received recognition from HEFCE for the purposes of the next Research Assessment Exercise , the approach of which has helped generate material for the journal . The journal is published in association with Blackstone Press who are under-writing the venture and who will publish the Blackstone Yearbook of Current Legal Issues which will contain all the articles which appear in the journal . Design and presentation of the journal has been the responsibility of Bruce Grant . Contributions are accepted in data form only , whether by e-mail or on disk . After assessment by the relevant member of the editorial committee and refereeing , the contribution is marked up with HTML tags for browsing on the Web and also converted to rich text format to facilitate printing . The use of postcript files for printing was considered , and may yet be adopted in addition to rtf , but on the whole rtf was felt to be the more commonly acceptable format . Because the journal is first published electronically , it has not been thought sensible to provide page numbers . Traditionally a page-count has been used as a rough measure of the length of articles , but perhaps , as e-journals become established , a word-count will be seen as a better , and universally applicable method of comparison . One of the major advantages of electronic publishing is that articles and comments accepted for publication will be published promptly in the next issue as an electronic law journal does not suffer from space constraints . Too often , long delays between submission of articles and their publication has served to rob many of their topicality and much of their potential impact . This factor of speed of publication has helped provide the focus for the journal which is on current legal issues in judicial decisions , law reform , legislation , legal research , policy related socio-legal research , legal education , information technology and practice . While the focus of the journal is on current legal issues in the United Kingdom ( including European Union matters ) , the editors are keen to receive contributions which adopt a comparative approach . The editors are also keen to encourage academic debate and will welcome responses to articles or comments previously published . Undoubtedly electronic publishing will increase in the future as the potential of the medium is realised . In the first issue of the journal a taster of this potential was provided in an article by Robin Widdison , Director of the Centre for Law and Computing at the University of Durham , which contained links to other sites on the Internet . As more materials are published in this way such links will become more frequent and will totally alter the way in which we write articles or , for that matter , read them .

These accounts permit borrowing from time to time at the account holder's discretion up to the amount of the credit line , and they typically have more flexible repayment schedules than those for the traditional home equity loans . Until recently , relatively little statistical information has been available on home equity lending . Some information about uses and users of home equity lines of credit became available in 1988 with publication of consumer surveys sponsored in 1987 by the Federal Reserve Board and industry-sponsored surveys of financial institutions ( see FEDERAL RESERVE BULLETIN , June 1988 , pages 361-73 ) . In addition , the Report of Condition for year-end 1987 made available for the first time comprehensive information about amounts outstanding under home equity lines of credit at commercial banks . None of these sources revealed much about traditional home equity loans , however . To learn more about traditional home equity loans and to relate trends in these closed-end loans to available information about home equity lines of credit , the Federal Reserve Board again participated in sponsoring consumer surveys in 1988 ( appendix A ) .

Please [ improve this article ] or discuss the issue on the talk page .. These surveys can be used to assess the use of home equity loans over time . Before the mid-pref . Middle : midbrain . 1980s , nearly all home equity loans were of the traditional type . More recent surveys provide information on consumer use of both types of home equity credit . Consumer surveys indicate that 5.4 percent of homeowners had a home equity loan in 1977 . ( 3 ) By 1983 , this proportion had risen only slightly , to 6.8 percent . 4 However , surveys taken last year reveal substantial growth in the use of home equity loans since 1983 . ( 5 ) These most recent surveys found that 11 percent of homeowners , or roughly 6.5 million families , had a home equity loan in the second half of 1988 . Closer examination of the 1988 surveys shows that 5.6 percent of homeowners had a home equity line of credit , while a nearly equal proportion , 5.3 percent , had a traditional home equity loan . Widespread consumer interest in home equity credit line plans dates to 1986 , when extensive promotion of such plans by financial institutions began .

Looking at 1988 originations alone , 63 percent were credit lines and 37 percent were closed-end loans .

SOURCES OF HOME EQUITY LOANS Before the mid-1970s , home equity loans were in large part the province of consumer finance companies , second mortgage companies , and individuals .

The specialization of finance companies in the traditional home equity loan market may in part reflect long-time customer relationships as well as limits on the services available from finance companies . Because finance companies typically do not offer deposit services ( except , in some cases , through banking affiliates ) , they are less well suited to offering credit accounts that can be accessed by check , a feature of virtually all home equity lines of credit .

See memorandum , "" Home Equity Loan Holding and Use : Results of 1988 Consumer Surveys , "" to the Consumer Advisory Council , January 24 , 1989 , table 4 . USERS AND USES OF HOME EQUITY CREDIT In general , home equity credit users fit the profile of a financially sophisticated , "" upscale "" group of consumers . However , important differences exist between holders of credit lines and users of traditional home equity loans . Moreover , differences among customers of each product in demographic characteristics , in uses of the funds , and in the perceived attractiveness of the two credit products all suggest that they may not be close substitutes in the minds of many consumers . Demographic Characteristics of Holders of Home Equity Loans Families that have a home equity credit line typically have higher incomes and have built up substantially more equity in their homes than homeowners in general have , or those with a first mortgage only ( table 2 ) . Families with traditional home equity loans likewise have higher incomes and more equity than the average first mortgagee n . the person or business making a loan that is secured by the real property of the person ( mortgagor ) who owes him / her / it money . ( See : mortgage , mortgagor ) MORTGAGEE , estates , contracts . He to whom a mortgage is made . , but they have significantly smaller amounts of each than holders of credit line accounts have . In 1987 , families with credit line accounts had median incomes of , 000 , and holders of traditional home equity loans had median incomes of , 000 . In comparison , the median income for those with a first mortgage only was , 000 . Median amounts of home equity were , 000 for credit line holders ,, 000 for those with traditional home equity loans , and , 000 for those who had a first mortgage only . Those borrowing against home equity also tend to be older than homeowners with a first mortgage only ; in part their higher incomes and home equity may reflect the fact that older homeowners have probably progressed further in their careers and have owned their homes longer . Homeowners with no mortgage debt at all tend to have siz · a · ble also size · a · bleadj . Of considerable size ; fairly large . siza · ble · ness n . equity and relatively low incomes ; the median age for this group is 65 , and many of them are on retirement incomes and have owned their homes for a long time . The strong correlation between the use of home equity for loan collateral and levels of family income and equity is further illustrated in table 3 , which groups homeowners by income and equity categories and shows the proportion of each group that has one or the other type of home equity product . The data reveal that home equity lines of credit in particular are an upscale product , with larger proportions of each of the higher-income groups ( , 000 or more in annual income ) holding a credit line account rather than a traditional home equity loan . The other demographic characteristics in tables 2 and 3 do not show significant differences between holders of credit lines and users of traditional home equity loans , although the latter are somewhat more likely to be nonwhite non · white n . A person who is not white . nonwhite adj . or Hispanic and to have had somewhat fewer years of formal schooling than credit line holders . The geographic breakdown in table 3 illustrates the pronounced regional character of the market for home equity lines of credit .

The 1st factor that I can get a credit score card in far better shape . Then the investigation of loan providers are starting to discover and get the price . Producing an energy to get the comparison is the only way to make certain you get the best feasible remedy . <a href=""http://equityloanconsultant.com""> Equity Loan Consultant </a> There are pros and cons when it comes to fixed charge house equity loans . However , in a stringent credit score crisis with very low interest prices , a fixed fee property equity mortgage is the very best selection . The factors are as the prime charge index goes up , so does the charge on your fixed home mortgage as well as the month-to-month payments . People who borrow in tight credit industry eras on their residence equity with an adjustable rate , may possibly appear to find out that even a slight rise in the prime can grow to be a hefty enhance in their month to month payments . An unfamiliar aspect omitted from the fixed charge equity mortgage could develop lots of financial angst for owners and their families . Some equity loan providers demand the borrower at the end of the period of time to make a "" balloon payment "" . This signifies a large , lump-sum payment , is required to shut the loan out or you will need to refinance . A fixed rate equity mortgage indicates there is nothing that can change as far as payment is concerned . Even though the interest prices for a fixed fee home mortgage are most likely increased than a variable charge , it is a calculated risk that a many borrowers are ready to take . If the curiosity rates go up they win , simply because their mortgage loan is fixed , unchanged by the market problems or unexpected swings . This is particularly crucial since we are in a international financial system and any crisis global or domestic could make uncertainty . A lot of folks who have had foreclosures are the ones with adjustable rate loans . Currently , individuals somewhat reduce prices are not as appealing to as several home owners , in particular those looking for a second mortgage or property equity loan . It is much more critical than actually to get a fixed price mortgage considering that rates are at their lowest . So , much more than probably charges will be transferring up subsequent time around by the Federal Reserve . By forgetting to ask for a conservative residence equity mortgage , it could consequence in payments turning out to be greater , and the stop end result is losing your home by default . Whilst a lot of loan providers and brokers will brag all about the rewards of adjustable price loans , and not necessarily have one themselves , their objective is to sell you a item as it perceived to be greater from its confront worth but intrinsically it is really risky . A fixed charge residence equity mortgage makes it possible for the homeowner to have a detailed and distinct spending budget on their earnings and not be anxious about the likelihood of a larger payment .

208,A14,"Eighth session Kingston , Jamaica 5-16 August 2002 Summary presentations on polymetallic massive sulphide deposits and cobalt-rich ferromanganese crusts Marine minerals and the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea1 A scientific revolution in our understanding of the way the Earth works occurred in the 1970s and early 1980s which significantly expanded our knowledge of marine minerals while the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea was being formulated . The scientific revolution entailed a major change in viewing the ocean basins and continents . Before the scientific revolution , the ocean basins were viewed as passive containers for the oceans . The continents and ocean basins were viewed as permanent features that had remained in their present positions through most of Earth's history . The marine mineral provisions of the Convention were written in terms of this old view , which only recognized those marine mineral deposits that had been derived from erosion of land and carried into the ocean in particulate or dissolved form by rivers . These minerals comprised heavy metal deposits ( tin , gold , etc. ) and gemstones ( especially diamonds ) deposited in sediments on continental margins , and manganese nodules precipitated on the floor of the deep ocean from metals dissolved in seawater . The scientific revolution revealed that the ocean basins are dynamic features that open and close on a time scale of millions of years , with concomitant movement of the land areas known as continental drift . The scientific revolution recognized the ocean basins as sources of types of mineral deposits in addition to those previously known . These newly recognized types of marine mineral resources include polymetallic sulphides containing copper , zinc , silver and gold in varying amounts . Polymetallic sulphide deposits are concentrated over thousands of years by seafloor hot springs at sites along an active global submerged volcanic mountain range that extends through all the ocean basins of the world . Polymetallic sulphide deposits also occur at sites associated with volcanic island chains such as those along the western boundary of the Pacific Ocean . Another newly recognized type of marine mineral resource is cobalt-rich iron-manganese crusts that are precipitated over millions of years on the submerged flanks of inactive underwater volcanoes from metals dissolved in seawater derived from input of metals by both rivers and seafloor hot springs . The hot springs not only concentrate polymetallic sulphide deposits and disperse metals into the oceans that contribute to the accumulation of cobalt-rich iron-manganese crusts , but also provide chemical energy from the Earth's interior that is used by microbes for their growth . The microbes are at the base of the food chain of an ecosystem of life forms at the hot springs that is largely independent of the light energy that fuels the photosynthesis in plants at the base of the food chain on land . The microbes are proving important as the source of new compounds for industrial and medical applications , and also include primitive forms that may hold the key to the origin of life . A current challenge is to incorporate these new mineral resources into the Convention regime in a way that protects the valuable life forms that they host . Polymetallic massive sulphide deposits at the modern seafloor and their resource potential2 Since 1979 , polymetallic massive sulphide deposits have been found at water depths up to 3,700 m in a variety of tectonic settings at the modern seafloor , including mid-ocean ridges , back-arc rifts and seamounts . Many of the sulphide deposits consist of a black smoker complex on top of a sulphide mound which commonly is underlain by a stockwork zone . It has been widely established that circulating seawater which is modified in a reaction zone close to a subaxial magma chamber is the principal carrier of metals and sulphur which are leached out of the oceanic basement . Precipitation of massive and stockwork sulphides at and beneath the seafloor takes place in response to mixing of the high-temperature ( up to 400 ° C ) metal-rich hydrothermal seawater fluid with ambient seawater . Polymetallic seafloor sulphide deposits can reach considerable size ( up to 100 million tonnes ) and often carry high concentrations of copper ( chalcopyrite ) , zinc ( sphalerite ) and lead ( galena ) in addition to gold and silver . It has been clearly documented that the mineralogical and chemical composition of polymetallic massive sulphides at the basalt-dominated mid-ocean ridges differs from those at back-arc spreading centres which are associated with more felsic volcanic rocks ( dacite , rhyolite ) . The latter are more similar to major sulphide deposits that are being mined on land today but which were once formed at spreading centres of paleo-oceans . Extremely high concentrations of gold ( up to 230 g / t with an average of 26 g / t for 40 samples analysed ) have recently been found in a new type of seafloor mineral deposit located in the crater of an extinct volcano in the territorial waters of Papua New Guinea . The particular style of mineralization and alteration bears many similarities to so-called "" epithermal gold deposits "" so far only known on the continents . In addition to circulating seawater , magmatic fluids carrying high concentrations of gold appear to be a significant metal source and are likely responsible for the strong precious metal enrichment . This type of mineralization is most likely to exist in other arc-related environments of the world's oceans . Due to the high concentration of base and precious metals , seafloor polymetallic sulphide deposits have recently attracted the interest of the international mining industry . The recovery of some of these deposits appears to be both economically and environmentally feasible due to certain advantages over land-based deposits and will likely become a reality within the present decade . Cobalt-rich ferromanganese crusts : geology , resources and technology3 Cobalt-rich iron-manganese crusts occur throughout the global ocean on seamounts , ridges and plateaux where currents have kept the rocks swept clean of sediments for millions of years . Crusts precipitate from cold ambient seawater onto rock substrates , forming pavements up to 250 mm thick . Crusts are important as a potential resource primarily for cobalt , but also for titanium , cerium , nickel , platinum , manganese , thallium , tellurium , tungsten , bismuth , zirconium and other metals . Crusts form at water depths of about 400-4 , 000 m , with the thickest and most cobalt-rich crusts occurring at depths of about 800-2 , 500 m . Gravity processes such as landslides , as well as sediment cover , submerged and emergent reefs , and currents control the distribution and thickness of crusts . Crusts occur on a wide variety of substrate rocks , making it difficult to distinguish the crusts from the substrate using remotely sensed data , which is an important aspect in terms of developing exploration technologies . Fortunately , crusts can be distinguished from the substrates by their much higher levels of gamma radiation . The physical properties of crusts , such as high mean porosity ( 60 per cent ) and extremely high mean surface area ( 300 m2 / g ) , as well as their incredibly slow rates of growth ( 1-6 millimetres per million years ) , are instrumental in allowing for the adsorption of large quantities of economically important metals from seawater onto the crust surfaces . Crusts are composed of the minerals vernadite ( manganese oxide ) and feroxyhyte ( iron oxide ) , with moderate amounts of carbonate fluorapatite ( CFA ) in thick crusts and minor amounts of quartz and feldspar in most crusts . Elements that commonly adsorbed on the vernadite include cobalt , nickel , zinc and thallium , and on the iron oxide , copper , lead , titanium , molybdenum , arsenic , vanadium , tungsten , zirconium , bismuth and tellurium . Bulk crusts contain maximum cobalt contents of up to 1.7 per cent , nickel to 1.1 per cent , and platinum to 1.3 parts per million ( ppm ) . Average cobalt contents of up to 0.5 to 1 per cent for large regions of the oceans make crusts the richest potential ore for cobalt that exists , onshore as well as offshore . Cobalt , nickel , titanium and platinum concentrations decrease , whereas silicon and aluminium increase in continental-margin crusts and in crusts with close proximity to West Pacific volcanic arcs . Vernadite-related elements decrease , whereas iron and copper increase with increasing water depth of crust occurrence . Cobalt , cerium , thallium , titanium , lead , tellurium and platinum are strongly concentrated in crusts over other metals because they are incorporated by oxidation reactions that produce more stable , less mobile compounds . Total rare-earth elements commonly vary between 0.1 per cent and 0.3 per cent and are derived from seawater along with other hydrogenetic elements , cobalt , manganese , nickel , etc. Cerium is a rare-earth element that is strongly enriched in crusts and has important economic potential . The seamounts and ridges on which crusts grow obstruct the flow of oceanic water masses , thereby creating a wide array of seamount-generated currents of generally enhanced energy relative to flow away from the seamounts . The effects of these currents are strongest at the outer rim of the summit region of seamounts , the area where the thickest crusts are found . Those seamount-specific currents also enhance turbulent mixing and produce upwelling , which increases primary productivity . These physical processes affect seamount biological communities , which vary from seamount to seamount . Seamount communities are characterized by relatively low density and low diversity where the crusts are thickest and cobalt-rich . The make-up of the seamount communities is determined by current patterns , topography , bottom sediment and rock types and coverage , seamount size , water depth , and size and magnitude of the oxygen-minimum zone . Environmental impact documents will require a much better understanding of seamount ecosystems and communities than currently exits . About 40 research cruises have been dedicated to the study of cobalt-rich crusts , mainly by Germany , Japan , United States of America , the Republic of Korea , the Russia Federation , China and France . The estimate of 40 cruises does not include some cruises completed by the USSR ( and later the Russia Federation ) and China that are not available to the author . However , based on an estimated 42 research cruises from 1981 through 2001 , it is suggested that minimum expenditures were about US $ 32 million for ship and associated scientific operations related to fieldwork , and $ 42 million for shore-based research , for a total investment of about $ 74 million . Research and development on the technology for mining crusts are only in their infancy . Detailed maps of crust deposits and a comprehensive understanding of small-scale seamount topography are not available , but are required to design the most appropriate mining strategies . Typical field operations for exploration have been to produce SeaBeam bathymetric maps and derivative back-scatter and slope-angle maps , along with seismic profiles , which are used together to select sampling sites . For reconnaissance work , 15 to 20 dredge hauls and cores are taken per seamount . Then video-camera surveys delineate crust , rock and sediment types and distributions , as well as crust thicknesses if possible . These exploration activities require the use of a large , well-equipped research vessel because of the large number of bottom acoustic beacons , the large towed equipment and the volume of samples collected . During advanced stages of exploration and site-specific surveys , it is suggested to use deep-towed side-scan sonar including swath bathymetry , and tethered remotely operated vehicles ( ROVs ) for mapping and delineation of small-scale topography . Extensive sampling of deposits can be accomplished by dredging , coring , using ROVs , and a device to take close-spaced samples that has not yet been developed . Gamma-radiation surveys will delineate crust thicknesses and the existence of crusts under thin blankets of sediment . Current-meter moorings will be required for an understanding of the seamount environment and biological sampling and surveys will be necessary . Twelve criteria have been developed for exploration for and exploitation of crusts : ( a ) Regional criteria ( i ) Large volcanic edifices shallower than 1 , 000-1 , 500 m ; ( ii ) Volcanic edifices older than 20 million years ; ( iii ) Volcanic structures not capped by large atolls or reefs ; ( iv ) Areas of strong and persistent bottom currents ; ( v ) A shallow and well-developed oxygen-minimum zone ; ( vi ) Areas isolated from input of abundant fluvial and eolian debris . ( b ) Site-specific criteria ( vii ) Subdued small-scale topography ; ( viii ) Summit terraces , saddles and passes ; ( ix ) Slope stability ; ( x ) Absence of local volcanism ; ( xi ) Average cobalt contents ≥ 0 . 8 per cent ; ( xii ) Average crust thicknesses ≥ 40 mm . Crust mining is technologically more difficult than manganese nodule mining . Recovery of nodules is relatively easy because they sit on a soft-sediment substrate , whereas crusts are weakly to strongly attached to substrate rock . For successful crust mining , it is essential to recover the crusts without collecting substrate rock , which would significantly dilute the ore grade . Five possible crust mining operations include fragmentation , crushing , lifting , pick-up and separation . The proposed method of crust recovery consists of a bottom-crawling vehicle attached to a surface-mining vessel by means of a hydraulic-pipe lift system and an electrical umbilical . The mining machine provides its own propulsion and travels at a speed of about 20 cm / s. Material throughput for the base-case mining scenario is 1,000,000 t / y . That scenario allows 80 per cent fragmentation efficiency and 25 per cent dilution of crust with substrate as reasonable miner capabilities . Some new and innovative systems that have been suggested for crust mining include water-jet stripping of crusts from the substrate , in situ leaching techniques and sonic removal of crusts from substrates . These suggestions offer promise and need to be further developed . The importance to the world economy of metals contained in crusts is reflected in their patterns of consumption . The primary uses of manganese , cobalt and nickel are in the manufacture of steel , to which they provide unique characteristics . Cobalt is also used in the electrical , communications , aerospace , and engine and tool manufacturing industries . Nickel is used additionally in chemical plants , petroleum refineries , electrical appliances and motor vehicles . Cobalt is produced as a by-product of copper mining and consequently the supply of cobalt is tied to the demand for copper . This is also true for tellurium , which is produced as a by-product of both copper and gold mining . This uncertainty in supply has caused industry to seek alternatives to cobalt and tellurium , resulting in only a modest growth in their markets over the past decade , and consequently relatively low prices . If substantial alternative sources of these metals are developed , there should be a greater incentive to reintroduce them in products and expanding markets . It has recently been determined that crusts contain metals other than manganese , cobalt , nickel , copper and platinum that may offer additional incentives in recovery . For example , titanium has the highest value after cobalt , cerium has a greater value than nickel , zirconium is equivalent to nickel , and tellurium has nearly twice the value of copper . This analysis assumes that economic extractive metallurgy can be developed for each of those metals . Based on grade , tonnage and oceanographic conditions , the central-equatorial Pacific region offers the best potential for crust mining , particularly the exclusive economic zone of Johnston Island ( United States ) , the Marshall Islands and international waters in the Mid-Pacific Mountains , although the exclusive economic zone of French Polynesia , Kiribati and the Federated States of Micronesia should also be considered . Supplies of the many metals found in crusts are essential for maintaining the efficiency of modern industrial societies and in improving the standard of living in the twenty-first century . There is a growing recognition that cobalt-rich crusts are an important potential resource . Accordingly , it is necessary to fill the information gap concerning various aspects of crust mining through research , exploration and technology development . Sulphide mineral resource exploitation and the hydrothermal vent fauna4 More than 500 new animal species have been described from deep-sea hydrothermal vents since their discovery in 1977 . Deep-sea vents have a high scientific value because they contain a large number of endemic and unusual species and are refuges for close relatives of ancient forms of life . Because they are visually spectacular , extreme environments , vent ecosystems have generated widespread public interest and are a resource which can be used to inform the public about earth processes and the way in which scientists work . It is not currently possible to predict how rapidly vent sites may recover from mining operations . Some organisms will be directly killed by mining machinery , while others nearby risk smothering by material settling from plumes of particulate matter . Individuals surviving these perturbations would be subject to a radical change in habitat , and the exploited sites will have a lesser scientific and educational value . Long-lived vent fields that host the largest mineral deposits are likely to be the most ecologically stable and have the highest biodiversity . A concentration of mining activities at such sites could produce regional effects on biological processes and organism abundance , to the point where the survival of some species could become an issue . The management or protection of all of the world's marine hydrothermal and seep sites is an unrealistic goal . Discussions should focus instead on the criteria for identifying sites for future protection that are of critical importance , or particularly sensitive to disturbance , because of their scientific or educational value or their significance for species survival .

1,A1,"China and a New Balance of Power SHANGHAI – The last rival superpower to the United States , the Soviet Union , collapsed in 1991 . But , apart from its military strength , the USSR was never really powerful enough to counterbalance US influence . In the late 1980's , Japan seemed capable of challenging America's industrial leadership , but by the 1990's it lost its competitive edge . China might itself wish to be a major force in a multi-polar world , but has been plagued by its lack of overall strength . Given these realities , China sees the expanding European Union as a likely counterweight to unchecked US power . In terms of economic output , today's EU is on par with the US . But it has yet to build a strong defense system that can respond effectively either to regional contingencies or to global needs . What would be the strength of such a system if and when it is developed , and how will it compare with that of the US ? In assessing America's strength , China follows US debates on the merits of a uni-polar or a multi-polar world with keen interest . Some Americans favor a uni-polar system in which the US dominates . Such a Pax Americana would cost the country less to sustain , but the world would worry if America adopts a wrong policy , as has been the case in Iraq . The US certainly has a right to curb terrorists like those who staged the attack on September 11 , 2001 . But the "" war on terror "" did not warrant the decision to attack a sovereign state and topple its government on the flawed presumption that it housed weapons of mass destruction and was linked to the 2001 attacks . The US went to war despite strong opposition from France , Germany , Russia , China , and other United Nations Security Council members . France and Germany have since sought to restore good relations with the US , but continue to disapprove of the war . The Middle East , always a region of concern for Europe , has become even less stable as a result of the war . American leadership has been one of the war's casualties . In China , the concept of an independent European defense – embodied in the European Security and Defense Policy ( ESDP ) , as well as the EU's Rapid Reaction Force ( RRF ) and various police missions – is thus generally seen as necessary and effective in a multi-polar world system . China observes that on most security matters , the ESDP will ( for now ) mimic American security interests , because the EU and US share fundamental values of human rights and democracy . Moreover , many EU members have simultaneously pledged their defense capabilities to NATO , which has been led by the US since its creation . But the ESDP , once fully developed , will not necessarily follow America's lead unconditionally , especially if American policy continues to deviate from the norm of international law , as in Iraq . As a result of acquiring a pan-European defense capacity , the Europeans are likely to play a more independent role than at present in managing intra-European security relations and carrying out global missions . China welcomes this expanded security role for the EU . Although it remains wary of international intervention by the EU , the substance and pattern of ESDP operations are likely to win China's respect for several reasons . First , China's leaders note that the ESDP gives priority to the legitimacy of its missions . So far , all ESDP missions have respected international law and governmental arrangements among disputing parties . Most of its military or police missions have been based on UN Security Council resolutions , and ESDP missions outside Europe have been at the invitation of local authorities . Of course , ESDP security missions , even those in accordance with Security Council resolutions , may not operate within the UN system – the EU prefers its own independent leadership . The ESDP does not necessarily require Security Council authorization as a condition for its missions , and it retains an independent role in executing them . However , when compared with the US , the ESDP ( in Chinese eyes ) cares far more about international legitimacy , backed by the authority of the UN . Second , the ESDP is concerned with good governance and institution building . The EU is keen to restore or establish human rights , stability , and prosperity . Outside Europe , the ESDP acts to enhance governance rather than promote regime change , and the EU has often assisted governments' efforts to improve security conditions . Third , the ESDP is open to international cooperation . The EU works with either non-EU states , such as NATO members like Canada , Norway , and Turkey , or applicants for EU membership . The ESDP cooperates with the UN and other regional organizations , such as the African Union and ASEAN . When the EU reaches out , it tends to play a leading role in these collaborations . There are good reasons to expect that China will continue to accept an independent European security mechanism . There is little concern , if any , about the ESDP intervening in internal Chinese affairs , such as Taiwan . Indeed , China wants a strong and independent Europe , and from that vantage point it is not too early for China to envisage a truly multi-polar global system . </doc>

54,A4,"11 IN WHICH THE PLOT THICKENS His visit to M. de Treville being paid , the pensive d ' Artagnan took the longest way homeward . On what was d ' Artagnan thinking , that he strayed thus from his path , gazing at the stars of heaven , and sometimes sighing , sometimes smiling ? He was thinking of Mme . Bonacieux . For an apprentice Musketeer the young woman was almost an ideal of love . Pretty , mysterious , initiated in almost all the secrets of the court , which reflected such a charming gravity over her pleasing features , it might be surmised that she was not wholly unmoved ; and this is an irresistible charm to novices in love . Moreover , d ' Artagnan had delivered her from the hands of the demons who wished to search and ill treat her ; and this important service had established between them one of those sentiments of gratitude which so easily assume a more tender character . D ' Artagnan already fancied himself , so rapid is the flight of our dreams upon the wings of imagination , accosted by a messenger from the young woman , who brought him some billet appointing a meeting , a gold chain , or a diamond . We have observed that young cavaliers received presents from their king without shame . Let us add that in these times of lax morality they had no more delicacy with respect to the mistresses ; and that the latter almost always left them valuable and durable remembrances , as if they essayed to conquer the fragility of their sentiments by the solidity of their gifts . Without a blush , men made their way in the world by the means of women blushing . Such as were only beautiful gave their beauty , whence , without doubt , comes the proverb , "" The most beautiful girl in the world can only give what she has . "" Such as were rich gave in addition a part of their money ; and a vast number of heroes of that gallant period may be cited who would neither have won their spurs in the first place , nor their battles afterward , without the purse , more or less furnished , which their mistress fastened to the saddle bow . D ' Artagnan owned nothing . Provincial diffidence , that slight varnish , the ephemeral flower , that down of the peach , had evaporated to the winds through the little orthodox counsels which the three Musketeers gave their friend . D ' Artagnan , following the strange custom of the times , considered himself at Paris as on a campaign , neither more nor less than if he had been in Flanders--Spain yonder , woman here . In each there was an enemy to contend with , and contributions to be levied . But , we must say , at the present moment d ' Artagnan was ruled by a feeling much more noble and disinterested . The mercer had said that he was rich ; the young man might easily guess that with so weak a man as M. Bonacieux ; and interest was almost foreign to this commencement of love , which had been the consequence of it . We say ALMOST , for the idea that a young , handsome , kind , and witty woman is at the same time rich takes nothing from the beginning of love , but on the contrary strengthens it . There are in affluence a crowd of aristocratic cares and caprices which are highly becoming to beauty . A fine and white stocking , a silken robe , a lace kerchief , a pretty slipper on the foot , a tasty ribbon on the head do not make an ugly woman pretty , but they make a pretty woman beautiful , without reckoning the hands , which gain by all this ; the hands , among women particularly , to be beautiful must be idle . Then d ' Artagnan , as the reader , from whom we have not concealed the state of his fortune , very well knows--d ' Artagnan was not a millionaire ; he hoped to become one someday , but the time which in his own mind he fixed upon for this happy change was still far distant . In the meanwhile , how disheartening to see the woman one loves long for those thousands of nothings which constitute a woman's happiness , and be unable to give her those thousands of nothings . At least , when the woman is rich and the lover is not , that which he can not offer she offers to herself ; and although it is generally with her husband's money that she procures herself this indulgence , the gratitude for it seldom reverts to him . Then d ' Artagnan , disposed to become the most tender of lovers , was at the same time a very devoted friend , In the midst of his amorous projects for the mercer's wife , he did not forget his friends . The pretty Mme . Bonacieux was just the woman to walk with in the Plain St. Denis or in the fair of St. Germain , in company with Athos , Porthos , and Aramis , to whom d ' Artagnan had often remarked this . Then one could enjoy charming little dinners , where one touches on one side the hand of a friend , and on the other the foot of a mistress . Besides , on pressing occasions , in extreme difficulties , d ' Artagnan would become the preserver of his friends . And M. Bonacieux ? whom d ' Artagnan had pushed into the hands of the officers , denying him aloud although he had promised in a whisper to save him . We are compelled to admit to our readers that d ' Artagnan thought nothing about him in any way ; or that if he did think of him , it was only to say to himself that he was very well where he was , wherever it might be . Love is the most selfish of all the passions . Let our readers reassure themselves . IF d ' Artagnan forgets his host , or appears to forget him , under the pretense of not knowing where he has been carried , we will not forget him , and we know where he is . But for the moment , let us do as did the amorous Gascon ; we will see after the worthy mercer later . D ' Artagnan , reflecting on his future amours , addressing himself to the beautiful night , and smiling at the stars , ascended the Rue Cherish-Midi , or Chase-Midi , as it was then called . As he found himself in the quarter in which Aramis lived , he took it into his head to pay his friend a visit in order to explain the motives which had led him to send Planchet with a request that he would come instantly to the mousetrap . Now , if Aramis had been at home when Planchet came to his abode , he had doubtless hastened to the Rue des Fossoyeurs , and finding nobody there but his other two companions perhaps , they would not be able to conceive what all this meant . This mystery required an explanation ; at least , so d ' Artagnan declared to himself . He likewise thought this was an opportunity for talking about pretty little Mme . Bonacieux , of whom his head , if not his heart , was already full . We must never look for discretion in first love . First love is accompanied by such excessive joy that unless the joy be allowed to overflow , it will stifle you . Paris for two hours past had been dark , and seemed a desert . Eleven o ' clock sounded from all the clocks of the Faubourg St. Germain . It was delightful weather . D ' Artagnan was passing along a lane on the spot where the Rue d ' Assas is now situated , breathing the balmy emanations which were borne upon the wind from the Rue de Vaugirard , and which arose from the gardens refreshed by the dews of evening and the breeze of night . From a distance resounded , deadened , however , by good shutters , the songs of the tipplers , enjoying themselves in the cabarets scattered along the plain . Arrived at the end of the lane , d ' Artagnan turned to the left . The house in which Aramis dwelt was situated between the Rue Cassette and the Rue Servandoni . D ' Artagnan had just passed the Rue Cassette , and already perceived the door of his friend's house , shaded by a mass of sycamores and clematis which formed a vast arch opposite the front of it , when he perceived something like a shadow issuing from the Rue Servandoni . This something was enveloped in a cloak , and d ' Artagnan at first believed it was a man ; but by the smallness of the form , the hesitation of the walk , and the indecision of the step , he soon discovered that it was a woman . Further , this woman , as if not certain of the house she was seeking , lifted up her eyes to look around her , stopped , went backward , and then returned again . D ' Artagnan was perplexed . "" Shall I go and offer her my services ? "" thought he . "" By her step she must be young ; perhaps she is pretty . Oh , yes ! But a woman who wanders in the streets at this hour only ventures out to meet her lover . If I should disturb a rendezvous , that would not be the best means of commencing an acquaintance . "" Meantime the young woman continued to advance , counting the houses and windows . This was neither long nor difficult . There were but three hotels in this part of the street ; and only two windows looking toward the road , one of which was in a pavilion parallel to that which Aramis occupied , the other belonging to Aramis himself . "" PARIDIEU ! "" said d ' Artagnan to himself , to whose mind the niece of the theologian reverted , "" PARDIEU , it would be droll if this belated dove should be in search of our friend's house . But on my soul , it looks so . Ah , my dear Aramis , this time I shall find you out . "" And d ' Artagnan , making himself as small as he could , concealed himself in the darkest side of the street near a stone bench placed at the back of a niche . The young woman continued to advance ; and in addition to the lightness of her step , which had betrayed her , she emitted a little cough which denoted a sweet voice . D ' Artagnan believed this cough to be a signal . Nevertheless , whether the cough had been answered by a similar signal which had fixed the irresolution of the nocturnal seeker , or whether without this aid she saw that she had arrived at the end of her journey , she resolutely drew near to Aramis's shutter , and tapped , at three equal intervals , with her bent finger . "" This is all very fine , dear Aramis , "" murmured d ' Artagnan . "" Ah , Monsieur Hypocrite , I understand how you study theology . "" The three blows were scarcely struck , when the inside blind was opened and a light appeared through the panes of the outside shutter . "" Ah , ah ! "" said the listener , "" not through doors , but through windows ! Ah , this visit was expected . We shall see the windows open , and the lady enter by escalade . Very pretty ! "" But to the great astonishment of d ' Artagnan , the shutter remained closed . Still more , the light which had shone for an instant disappeared , and all was again in obscurity . D ' Artagnan thought this could not last long , and continued to look with all his eyes and listen with all his ears . He was right ; at the end of some seconds two sharp taps were heard inside . The young woman in the street replied by a single tap , and the shutter was opened a little way . It may be judged whether d ' Artagnan looked or listened with avidity . Unfortunately the light had been removed into another chamber ; but the eyes of the young man were accustomed to the night . Besides , the eyes of the Gascons have , as it is asserted , like those of cats , the faculty of seeing in the dark . D ' Artagnan then saw that the young woman took from her pocket a white object , which she unfolded quickly , and which took the form of a handkerchief . She made her interlocutor observe the corner of this unfolded object . This immediately recalled to d ' Artagnan's mind the handkerchief which he had found at the feet of Mme . Bonacieux , which had reminded him of that which he had dragged from under the feet of Aramis . "" What the devil could that handkerchief signify ? "" Placed where he was , d ' Artagnan could not perceive the face of Aramis . We say Aramis , because the young man entertained no doubt that it was his friend who held this dialogue from the interior with the lady of the exterior . Curiosity prevailed over prudence ; and profiting by the preoccupation into which the sight of the handkerchief appeared to have plunged the two personages now on the scene , he stole from his hiding place , and quick as lightning , but stepping with utmost caution , he ran and placed himself close to the angle of the wall , from which his eye could pierce the interior of Aramis's room . Upon gaining this advantage d ' Artagnan was near uttering a cry of surprise ; it was not Aramis who was conversing with the nocturnal visitor , it was a woman ! D ' Artagnan , however , could only see enough to recognize the form of her vestments , not enough to distinguish her features . At the same instant the woman inside drew a second handkerchief from her pocket , and exchanged it for that which had just been shown to her . Then some words were spoken by the two women . At length the shutter closed . The woman who was outside the window turned round , and passed within four steps of d ' Artagnan , pulling down the hood of her mantle ; but the precaution was too late , d ' Artagnan had already recognized Mme . Bonacieux . Mme . Bonacieux ! The suspicion that it was she had crossed the mind of d ' Artagnan when she drew the handkerchief from her pocket ; but what probability was there that Mme . Bonacieux , who had sent for M. Laporte in order to be reconducted to the Louvre , should be running about the streets of Paris at half past eleven at night , at the risk of being abducted a second time ? This must be , then , an affair of importance ; and what is the most important affair to a woman of twenty-five ! Love . But was it on her own account , or on account of another , that she exposed herself to such hazards ? This was a question the young man asked himself , whom the demon of jealousy already gnawed , being in heart neither more nor less than an accepted lover . There was a very simple means of satisfying himself whither Mme . Bonacieux was going ; that was to follow her . This method was so simple that d ' Artagnan employed it quite naturally and instinctively . But at the sight of the young man , who detached himself from the wall like a statue walking from its niche , and at the noise of the steps which she heard resound behind her , Mme . Bonacieux uttered a little cry and fled . D ' Artagnan ran after her . It was not difficult for him to overtake a woman embarrassed with her cloak . He came up with her before she had traversed a third of the street . The unfortunate woman was exhausted , not by fatigue , but by terror , and when d ' Artagnan placed his hand upon her shoulder , she sank upon one knee , crying in a choking voice , "" Kill me , if you please , you shall know nothing ! "" D ' Artagnan raised her by passing his arm round her waist ; but as he felt by her weight she was on the point of fainting , he made haste to reassure her by protestations of devotedness . These protestations were nothing for Mme . Bonacieux , for such protestations may be made with the worst intentions in the world ; but the voice was all . Mme . Bonacieux thought she recognized the sound of that voice ; she reopened her eyes , cast a quick glance upon the man who had terrified her so , and at once perceiving it was d ' Artagnan , she uttered a cry of joy , "" Oh , it is you , it is you ! Thank God , thank God ! "" "" Yes , it is I , "" said d ' Artagnan , "" it is I , whom God has sent to watch over you . "" "" Was it with that intention you followed me ? "" asked the young woman , with a coquettish smile , whose somewhat bantering character resumed its influence , and with whom all fear had disappeared from the moment in which she recognized a friend in one she had taken for an enemy . "" No , "" said d ' Artagnan ; "" no , I confess it . It was chance that threw me in your way ; I saw a woman knocking at the window of one of my friends . "" "" One of your friends ? "" interrupted Mme . Bonacieux . "" Without doubt ; Aramis is one of my best friends . "" "" Aramis ! Who is he ? "" "" Come , come , you wo n ' t tell me you do n't know Aramis ? "" "" This is the first time I ever heard his name pronounced . "" "" It is the first time , then , that you ever went to that house ? "" "" Undoubtedly . "" "" And you did not know that it was inhabited by a young man ? "" "" No. "" "" By a Musketeer ? "" "" No , indeed ! "" "" It was not he , then , you came to seek ? "" "" Not the least in the world . Besides , you must have seen that the person to whom I spoke was a woman . "" "" That is true ; but this woman is a friend of Aramis -- "" "" I know nothing of that . "" "" -- since she lodges with him . "" "" That does not concern me . "" "" But who is she ? "" "" Oh , that is not my secret . "" "" My dear Madame Bonacieux , you are charming ; but at the same time you are one of the most mysterious women . "" "" Do I lose by that ? "" "" No ; you are , on the contrary , adorable . "" "" Give me your arm , then . "" "" Most willingly . And now ? "" "" Now escort me . "" "" Where ? "" "" Where I am going . "" "" But where are you going ? "" "" You will see , because you will leave me at the door . "" "" Shall I wait for you ? "" "" That will be useless . "" "" You will return alone , then ? "" "" Perhaps yes , perhaps no . "" "" But will the person who shall accompany you afterward be a man or a woman ? "" "" I do n't know yet . "" "" But I will know it ! "" "" How so ? "" "" I will wait until you come out . "" "" In that case , adieu . "" "" Why so ? "" "" I do not want you . "" "" But you have claimed -- "" "" The aid of a gentleman , not the watchfulness of a spy . "" "" The word is rather hard . "" "" How are they called who follow others in spite of them ? "" "" They are indiscreet . "" "" The word is too mild . "" "" Well , madame , I perceive I must do as you wish . "" "" Why did you deprive yourself of the merit of doing so at once ? "" "" Is there no merit in repentance ? "" "" And do you really repent ? "" "" I know nothing about it myself . But what I know is that I promise to do all you wish if you allow me to accompany you where you are going . "" "" And you will leave me then ? "" "" Yes . "" "" Without waiting for my coming out again ? "" "" Yes . "" "" Word of honor ? "" "" By the faith of a gentleman . Take my arm , and let us go . "" D ' Artagnan offered his arm to Mme . Bonacieux , who willingly took it , half laughing , half trembling , and both gained the top of Rue de la Harpe . Arriving there , the young woman seemed to hesitate , as she had before done in the Rue Vaugirard . She seemed , however , by certain signs , to recognize a door , and approaching that door , "" And now , monsieur , "" said she , "" it is here I have business ; a thousand thanks for your honorable company , which has saved me from all the dangers to which , alone I was exposed . But the moment is come to keep your word ; I have reached my destination . "" "" And you will have nothing to fear on your return ? "" "" I shall have nothing to fear but robbers . "" "" And that is nothing ? "" "" What could they take from me ? I have not a penny about me . "" "" You forget that beautiful handkerchief with the coat of arms . "" "" Which ? "" "" That which I found at your feet , and replaced in your pocket . "" "" Hold your tongue , imprudent man ! Do you wish to destroy me ? "" "" You see very plainly that there is still danger for you , since a single word makes you tremble ; and you confess that if that word were heard you would be ruined . Come , come , madame ! "" cried d ' Artagnan , seizing her hands , and surveying her with an ardent glance , "" come , be more generous . Confide in me . Have you not read in my eyes that there is nothing but devotion and sympathy in my heart ? "" "" Yes , "" replied Mme . Bonacieux ; "" therefore , ask my own secrets , and I will reveal them to you ; but those of others--that is quite another thing . "" "" Very well , "" said d ' Artagnan , "" I shall discover them ; as these secrets may have an influence over your life , these secrets must become mine . "" "" Beware of what you do ! "" cried the young woman , in a manner so serious as to make d ' Artagnan start in spite of himself . "" Oh , meddle in nothing which concerns me . Do not seek to assist me in that which I am accomplishing . This I ask of you in the name of the interest with which I inspire you , in the name of the service you have rendered me and which I never shall forget while I have life . Rather , place faith in what I tell you . Have no more concern about me ; I exist no longer for you , any more than if you had never seen me . "" "" Must Aramis do as much as I , madame ? "" said d ' Artagnan , deeply piqued . "" This is the second or third time , monsieur , that you have repeated that name , and yet I have told you that I do not know him . "" "" You do not know the man at whose shutter you have just knocked ? Indeed , madame , you believe me too credulous ! "" "" Confess that it is for the sake of making me talk that you invent this story and create this personage . "" "" I invent nothing , madame ; I create nothing . I only speak that exact truth . "" "" And you say that one of your friends lives in that house ? "" "" I say so , and I repeat it for the third time ; that house is one inhabited by my friend , and that friend is Aramis . "" "" All this will be cleared up at a later period , "" murmured the young woman ; "" no , monsieur , be silent . "" "" If you could see my heart , "" said d ' Artagnan , "" you would there read so much curiosity that you would pity me and so much love that you would instantly satisfy my curiosity . We have nothing to fear from those who love us . "" "" You speak very suddenly of love , monsieur , "" said the young woman , shaking her head . "" That is because love has come suddenly upon me , and for the first time ; and because I am only twenty . "" The young woman looked at him furtively . "" Listen ; I am already upon the scent , "" resumed d ' Artagnan . "" About three months ago I was near having a duel with Aramis concerning a handkerchief resembling the one you showed to the woman in his house--for a handkerchief marked in the same manner , I am sure . "" "" Monsieur , "" said the young woman , "" you weary me very much , I assure you , with your questions . "" "" But you , madame , prudent as you are , think , if you were to be arrested with that handkerchief , and that handkerchief were to be seized , would you not be compromised ? "" "" In what way ? The initials are only mine -- C. B. , Constance Bonacieux . "" "" Or Camille de Bois-Tracy . "" "" Silence , monsieur ! Once again , silence ! Ah , since the dangers I incur on my own account can not stop you , think of those you may yourself run ! "" "" Me ? "" "" Yes ; there is peril of imprisonment , risk of life in knowing me . "" "" Then I will not leave you . "" "" Monsieur ! "" said the young woman , supplicating him and clasping her hands together , "" monsieur , in the name of heaven , by the honor of a soldier , by the courtesy of a gentleman , depart ! There , there midnight sounds ! That is the hour when I am expected . "" "" Madame , "" said the young man , bowing ; "" I can refuse nothing asked of me thus . Be content ; I will depart . "" "" But you will not follow me ; you will not watch me ? "" "" I will return home instantly . "" "" Ah , I was quite sure you were a good and brave young man , "" said Mme . Bonacieux , holding out her hand to him , and placing the other upon the knocker of a little door almost hidden in the wall . D ' Artagnan seized the hand held out to him , and kissed it ardently . "" Ah ! I wish I had never seen you ! "" cried d ' Artagnan , with that ingenuous roughness which women often prefer to the affectations of politeness , because it betrays the depths of the thought and proves that feeling prevails over reason . "" Well ! "" resumed Mme . Bonacieux , in a voice almost caressing , and pressing the hand of d ' Artagnan , who had not relinquished hers , "" well : I will not say as much as you do ; what is lost for today may not be lost forever . Who knows , when I shall be at liberty , that I may not satisfy your curiosity ? "" "" And will you make the same promise to my love ? "" cried d ' Artagnan , beside himself with joy . "" Oh , as to that , I do not engage myself . That depends upon the sentiments with which you may inspire me . "" "" Then today , madame -- "" "" Oh , today , I am no further than gratitude . "" "" Ah ! You are too charming , "" said d ' Artagnan , sorrowfully ; "" and you abuse my love . "" "" No , I use your generosity , that 's all . But be of good cheer ; with certain people , everything comes round . "" "" Oh , you render me the happiest of men ! Do not forget this evening--do not forget that promise . "" "" Be satisfied . In the proper time and place I will remember everything . Now then , go , go , in the name of heaven ! I was expected at sharp midnight , and I am late . "" "" By five minutes . "" "" Yes ; but in certain circumstances five minutes are five ages . "" "" When one loves . "" "" Well ! And who told you I had no affair with a lover ? "" "" It is a man , then , who expects you ? "" cried d ' Artagnan . "" A man ! "" "" The discussion is going to begin again ! "" said Mme . Bonacieux , with a half-smile which was not exempt from a tinge of impatience . "" No , no ; I go , I depart ! I believe in you , and I would have all the merit of my devotion , even if that devotion were stupidity . Adieu , madame , adieu ! "" And as if he only felt strength to detach himself by a violent effort from the hand he held , he sprang away , running , while Mme . Bonacieux knocked , as at the shutter , three light and regular taps . When he had gained the angle of the street , he turned . The door had been opened , and shut again ; the mercer's pretty wife had disappeared . D ' Artagnan pursued his way . He had given his word not to watch Mme . Bonacieux , and if his life had depended upon the spot to which she was going or upon the person who should accompany her , d ' Artagnan would have returned home , since he had so promised . Five minutes later he was in the Rue des Fossoyeurs . "" Poor Athos ! "" said he ; "" he will never guess what all this means . He will have fallen asleep waiting for me , or else he will have returned home , where he will have learned that a woman had been there . A woman with Athos ! After all , "" continued d ' Artagnan , "" there was certainly one with Aramis . All this is very strange ; and I am curious to know how it will end . "" "" Badly , monsieur , badly ! "" replied a voice which the young man recognized as that of Planchet ; for , soliloquizing aloud , as very preoccupied people do , he had entered the alley , at the end of which were the stairs which led to his chamber . "" How badly ? What do you mean by that , you idiot ? "" asked d ' Artagnan . "" What has happened ? "" "" All sorts of misfortunes . "" "" What ? "" "" In the first place , Monsieur Athos is arrested . "" "" Arrested ! Athos arrested ! What for ? "" "" He was found in your lodging ; they took him for you . "" "" And by whom was he arrested ? "" "" By Guards brought by the men in black whom you put to flight . "" "" Why did he not tell them his name ? Why did he not tell them he knew nothing about this affair ? "" "" He took care not to do so , monsieur ; on the contrary , he came up to me and said , ' It is your master that needs his liberty at this moment and not I , since he knows everything and I know nothing . They will believe he is arrested , and that will give him time ; in three days I will tell them who I am , and they can not fail to let me go . ' "" "" Bravo , Athos ! Noble heart ! "" murmured d ' Artagnan . "" I know him well there ! And what did the officers do ? "" "" Four conveyed him away , I do n't know where--to the Bastille or Fort l ' Eveque . Two remained with the men in black , who rummaged every place and took all the papers . The last two mounted guard at the door during this examination ; then , when all was over , they went away , leaving the house empty and exposed . "" "" And Porthos and Aramis ? "" "" I could not find them ; they did not come . "" "" But they may come any moment , for you left word that I awaited them ? "" "" Yes , monsieur . "" "" Well , do n't budge , then ; if they come , tell them what has happened . Let them wait for me at the Pomme-de-Pin . Here it would be dangerous ; the house may be watched . I will run to Monsieur de Treville to tell them all this , and will meet them there . "" "" Very well , monsieur , "" said Planchet . "" But you will remain ; you are not afraid ? "" said d ' Artagnan , coming back to recommend courage to his lackey . "" Be easy , monsieur , "" said Planchet ; "" you do not know me yet . I am brave when I set about it . It is all in beginning . Besides , I am a Picard . "" "" Then it is understood , "" said d ' Artagnan ; "" you would rather be killed than desert your post ? "" "" Yes , monsieur ; and there is nothing I would not do to prove to Monsieur that I am attached to him . "" "" Good ! "" said d ' Artagnan to himself . "" It appears that the method I have adopted with this boy is decidedly the best . I shall use it again upon occasion . "" And with all the swiftness of his legs , already a little fatigued however , with the perambulations of the day , d ' Artagnan directed his course toward M. de Treville's . M. de Treville was not at his hotel . His company was on guard at the Louvre ; he was at the Louvre with his company . It was necessary to reach M. de Treville ; it was important that he should be informed of what was passing . D ' Artagnan resolved to try and enter the Louvre . His costume of Guardsman in the company of M. Dessessart ought to be his passport . He therefore went down the Rue des Petits Augustins , and came up to the quay , in order to take the New Bridge . He had at first an idea of crossing by the ferry ; but on gaining the riverside , he had mechanically put his hand into his pocket , and perceived that he had not wherewithal to pay his passage . As he gained the top of the Rue Guenegaud , he saw two persons coming out of the Rue Dauphine whose appearance very much struck him . Of the two persons who composed this group , one was a man and the other a woman . The woman had the outline of Mme . Bonacieux ; the man resembled Aramis so much as to be mistaken for him . Besides , the woman wore that black mantle which d ' Artagnan could still see outlined on the shutter of the Rue de Vaugirard and on the door of the Rue de la Harpe ; still further , the man wore the uniform of a Musketeer . The woman's hood was pulled down , and the man held a handkerchief to his face . Both , as this double precaution indicated , had an interest in not being recognized . They took the bridge . That was d ' Artagnan's road , as he was going to the Louvre . D ' Artagnan followed them . He had not gone twenty steps before he became convinced that the woman was really Mme . Bonacieux and that the man was Aramis . He felt at that instant all the suspicions of jealousy agitating his heart . He felt himself doubly betrayed , by his friend and by her whom he already loved like a mistress . Mme . Bonacieux had declared to him , by all the gods , that she did not know Aramis ; and a quarter of an hour after having made this assertion , he found her hanging on the arm of Aramis . D ' Artagnan did not reflect that he had only known the mercer's pretty wife for three hours ; that she owed him nothing but a little gratitude for having delivered her from the men in black , who wished to carry her off , and that she had promised him nothing . He considered himself an outraged , betrayed , and ridiculed lover . Blood and anger mounted to his face ; he was resolved to unravel the mystery . The young man and young woman perceived they were watched , and redoubled their speed . D ' Artagnan determined upon his course . He passed them , then returned so as to meet them exactly before the Samaritaine . Which was illuminated by a lamp which threw its light over all that part of the bridge . D ' Artagnan stopped before them , and they stopped before him . "" What do you want , monsieur ? "" demanded the Musketeer , recoiling a step , and with a foreign accent , which proved to d ' Artagnan that he was deceived in one of his conjectures . "" It is not Aramis ! "" cried he . "" No , monsieur , it is not Aramis ; and by your exclamation I perceive you have mistaken me for another , and pardon you . "" "" You pardon me ? "" cried d ' Artagnan . "" Yes , "" replied the stranger . "" Allow me , then , to pass on , since it is not with me you have anything to do . "" "" You are right , monsieur , it is not with you that I have anything to do ; it is with Madame . "" "" With Madame ! You do not know her , "" replied the stranger . "" You are deceived , monsieur ; I know her very well . "" "" Ah , "" said Mme . Bonacieux ; in a tone of reproach , "" ah , monsieur , I had your promise as a soldier and your word as a gentleman . I hoped to be able to rely upon that . "" "" And I , madame ! "" said d ' Artagnan , embarrassed ; "" you promised me -- "" "" Take my arm , madame , "" said the stranger , "" and let us continue our way . "" D ' Artagnan , however , stupefied , cast down , annihilated by all that happened , stood , with crossed arms , before the Musketeer and Mme . Bonacieux . The Musketeer advanced two steps , and pushed d ' Artagnan aside with his hand . D ' Artagnan made a spring backward and drew his sword . At the same time , and with the rapidity of lightning , the stranger drew his . "" In the name of heaven , my Lord ! "" cried Mme . Bonacieux , throwing herself between the combatants and seizing the swords with her hands . "" My Lord ! "" cried d ' Artagnan , enlightened by a sudden idea , "" my Lord ! Pardon me , monsieur , but you are not -- "" "" My Lord the Duke of Buckingham , "" said Mme . Bonacieux , in an undertone ; "" and now you may ruin us all . "" "" My Lord , Madame , I ask a hundred pardons ! But I love her , my Lord , and was jealous . You know what it is to love , my Lord . Pardon me , and then tell me how I can risk my life to serve your Grace ? "" "" You are a brave young man , "" said Buckingham , holding out his hand to d ' Artagnan , who pressed it respectfully . "" You offer me your services ; with the same frankness I accept them . Follow us at a distance of twenty paces , as far as the Louvre , and if anyone watches us , slay him ! "" D ' Artagnan placed his naked sword under his arm , allowed the duke and Mme . Bonacieux to take twenty steps ahead , and then followed them , ready to execute the instructions of the noble and elegant minister of Charles I. Fortunately , he had no opportunity to give the duke this proof of his devotion , and the young woman and the handsome Musketeer entered the Louvre by the wicket of the Echelle without any interference . As for d ' Artagnan , he immediately repaired to the cabaret of the Pomme-de-Pin , where he found Porthos and Aramis awaiting him . Without giving them any explanation of the alarm and inconvenience he had caused them , he told them that he had terminated the affair alone in which he had for a moment believed he should need their assistance . Meanwhile , carried away as we are by our narrative , we must leave our three friends to themselves , and follow the Duke of Buckingham and his guide through the labyrinths of the Louvre . </doc>

1670,A16,"Wipeout Pulse ( stylised as wipEout pulse ) is a futuristic racing video game developed by SCE Studio Liverpool and published by Sony Computer Entertainment for the PlayStation Portable . It was first released in December 2007 in Australia and Europe , and in February 2008 in North America . A PlayStation 2 port was released exclusively in Europe in June 2009 . The game is the seventh instalment of the Wipeout series and serves as a sequel to Wipeout Pure . It takes place in 2198 and revolves around players competing in the FX400 anti-gravity racing league . The game was developed by Sony Studio Liverpool . Production was centred around focusing on the feedback left by fans regarding Wipeout Pure , and improving on aspects where the development team thought they had failed in with the predecessor . The game features sixteen licensed music tracks from techno artists , including Kraftwerk . Wipeout Pulse received positive reviews upon release . Critics praised the graphics and presentation , although some criticised the repetitiveness and hard difficulty . From left to right clockwise , the interface displays the number of laps , the teams of competing players , speedometer , shield strength , current playing song , and lap time . Wipeout Pulse is a racing game set in 2198 , one year after the events of Wipeout Pure . As with its predecessor , the game revolves around players competing in the FX400 anti-gravity racing league . Players pilot anti-gravity ships owned by racing corporations ( collectively refereed to as "" teams "" in-game ) . There are ten teams in Wipeout Pulse , with one ship available for each – although the player will have the ability to upgrade and change the appearance of their ships . Each ship has different characteristics ; depending on the team chosen , its ship will vary in terms of handling , speed , acceleration and shield strength . Every ship is equipped with an energy shield which will protect the player from damage sustained from weapons fire or colliding with walls , although energy is taken away if this happens . If the shield completely runs out , the ship will explode and the player will be eliminated from the race . In addition , the player's ship is equipped with air brakes which can be used for manoeuvring through difficult corners at high speed . The game features a number of weapons which can be utilised to destroy other opponents or for self-defence . Defensive weapons range from shields – which make the player's ship invulnerable to damage for a short period – to land mines and stationary bombs . Offensive weaponry vary from machine guns , missiles , plasma bolts , and a "" quake "" – which comes in the form of a devastating earthquake that will damage all opponents . The campaign mode features sixteen grids divided into cells , each containing a separate event which will vary from ordinary races to tournaments . Once the player finishes the event in a single cell , they will earn "" completion points "" needed to progress to the next grid . Clearing a cell will unlock additional cells adjoining it . Returning game modes from Wipeout Pure includes single races , tournaments , time trials , and the "" Zone "" mode , which involves the player's ship automatically accelerating to extreme speeds . A returning game mode from Wipeout 3 is "" Elimination "" , which revolves around a group of competitors attempting to destroy each other the quickest in a set amount of time . Wipeout Pulse was developed by Sony Studio Liverpool ( formerly known as Psygnosis ) . Colin Berry , the lead designer of the game , stated in an interview that the team had received a lot of positive feedback from Wipeout Pure , and was willing to use parts of the feedback to "" help shape some elements of Pulse "" . According to Berry , some people had felt that the previous game was too difficult ; the ships were considered too fast and the artificial intelligence ( AI ) too advanced , whereas others thought that the game was too easy and they wanted "" something more challenging to keep them coming back "" . The development team also took steps to decrease the feeling of repetition , which was often cited as one of the main complaints of Wipeout Pure . In addition , the team altered the game's difficulty settings so that players were given the choice to change the speed of the game at any time , in the event that they "" got stuck "" . Reflecting on this , Berry said : "" We want the people who buy it , to see all the game , we do not want to lock them out "" . During development , the team decided early on to focus on creating new content rather than bringing back old race tracks which were featured in previous Wipeout games . Berry , however , acknowledged that classic tracks "" went down well "" and sought out the possibility of introducing them through future downloadable content ( DLC ) . Berry stated that by the end of Wipeout Pure , Sony Studio Liverpool had designed almost 100 tracks as potentials to include in subsequent games , although the team were only satisfied with 32 of them . The remainder of the tracks were either disregarded or amalgamated into other games . Berry reflected that the tracks using the same 3D computer graphics software as its predecessor meant that certain repetition appeared and caused the team to "" dry up on ideas "" . The developers recognised that track design was an important aspect to the game , and also accepted the difficulty in designing a track that is both memorable and enjoyable . Berry felt concerned that the team were starting to repeat design features , and thus decided to create new variables to the track design : as a result of this , the team conceptualised the "" mag strip "" – a section of a track which would feature artificial gravity so that a player could safely circumnavigate loops , steep slopes , and upside down sections . After the release of Wipeout Pure on the PlayStation Portable , rumours circulated that a port was in development for the PlayStation 2 . In January 2009 , Sony issued a statement saying : "" There are over 9.5 million PS2s in the UK and we will continue to support this large userbase with software on an ongoing basis "" . The PlayStation 2 version was released exclusively in Europe in June 2009 , featuring enhanced graphics and all of the DLC . The game also features sixteen licensed music tracks in addition to customisable soundtracks from techno artists , including Kraftwerk , DJ Fresh , and Skream . The game received positive reviews upon release . It holds an average score of 82 per cent at Metacritic , based on an aggregate of 40 reviews . Critics unanimously praised the game's visuals and presentation . Jeff Haynes of IGN stated that the game was "" Wipeout at its purest "" , praising the visual presentation of the courses , cities , and other environments . Gabe Graziani of GameSpy thought the graphics were beautiful and also commended the design of the tracks . Eduardo Zacarias of GameZone stated that Wipeout Pulse was a "" very visually pleasing game with some solid visual effects "" , and also praised the detailed tracks and ships . A reviewer from Game Revolution considered the game's level of detail to the tracks and smooth framerate to be "" staggering "" on a handheld . The reviewer also praised the "" meticulously constructed "" backdrops and "" incredibly styled "" presentation . Guy Cocker of GameSpot said that the visuals were "" superb "" , though he thought that many aspects were similar to its predecessor , Wipeout Pure . A reviewer from Edge described the visuals as "" even smoother , brighter , and sharper than Pure's "" . The various aspects of gameplay were mostly praised , although some reviewers criticised the game's repetitiveness and difficulty . Tom Bradwell from Eurogamer praised the new "" Elimination "" mode , stating that it was initially "" alarming "" and frustrating , but admitted that it "" grows to be rather good "" . Cocker enjoyed the new tracks , the difficulty levels , and the promise of downloadable content , although he noted that it had not been made available in the United States at the time of his review . Game Revolution's reviewer surmised that Wipeout Pulse was a more refined version of Wipeout Pure , stating that despite all of the solid and reliable gameplay , the game did not revolutionise the series . Regarding general gameplay , Zacarias opined that Wipeout Pulse "" does n't deliver "" despite the variety in the game modes and "" racetrack front "" . Haynes similarly gave a negative opinion on the gameplay , stating that the repetition of tracks and balance of weapons for the AI was disappointing . Graziani criticised the game's difficulty , saying that it was "" extremely challenging to the point of being impenetrable for the uninitiated "" . Edge ' s reviewer described the game as simply another instalment of Wipeout . </doc>

1474,A7,"cat health Pet owners who are health conscious may be wondering if a cat health remedy is necessary for their pet . In this article , you will learn why a daily remedy is important for good health and what to look for in a quality supplement . Prevention becomes even more important when you realize how the quality of our food , water and environment have changed over the past fifty years . For instance , the environment is more polluted than at any other time in history . Food is less nutrient-rich because it is grown in over-farmed , mineral deficient soil . It is also sprayed with pesticides . Water is treated by the city water treatment plant and is full of chemicals . These toxins adversely affect humans and they have the same effect on our beloved pets who did nothing to contribute to the mess that we are in . So let 's talk about what to look for in a good supplement because there are many on the market and some are better than others . The formulation that I recommend has antioxidants and uses herbs that cats would normally chew on in the wild if allowed freedom to roam . These herbs include Mistletoe , Echinacea , Astralagus , Milk Thistle and of course , Cat's Claw . Together , this formulation can increase lung and heart health , build immunity , provide much-need nutrients and even fight cancer and other immune-suppressing disorders . If you choose to give your pet a daily cat health remedy , you might as well give your pet the best . In addition to giving your pet a supplement , other important ways of promoting cat health are to get a tap filter to remove all those chemicals from city water and feed your pet healthy food . Make sure to read the ingredients label to ensure that it 's not the equivalent of junk food as some commercial brands are . Watch out for dyes , chemicals and cheap grains and fillers . </doc>

145,A11,"I 'm just going to play a brief video clip . Video : 50,000 pounds . On the fifth of December 1985 , a bottle of 1787 Lafitte was sold for 105,000 pounds -- nine times the previous world record . Mr. Forbes . The buyer was Kip Forbes , son of one of the most flamboyant millionaires of the 20th century . The original owner of the bottle turned out to be one of the most enthusiastic wine buffs of the 18th century . Château Lafitte is one of the greatest wines in the world , the prince of any wine cellar . Benjamin Wallace : Now , that 's about all the videotape that remains of an event that set off the longest-running mystery in the modern wine world . And the mystery existed because of a gentleman named Hardy Rodenstock . In 1985 , he announced to his friends in the wine world that he had made this incredible discovery . Some workmen in Paris had broken through a brick wall , and happened upon this hidden cache of wines -- apparently the property of Thomas Jefferson . 1787 , 1784 . He would n ' t reveal the exact number of bottles , he would not reveal exactly where the building was and he would not reveal exactly who owned the building . The mystery persisted for about 20 years . It finally began to get resolved in 2005 because of this guy . Bill Koch is a Florida billionaire who owns four of the Jefferson bottles , and he became suspicious . And he ended up spending over a million dollars and hiring ex-FBI and ex-Scotland Yard agents to try to get to the bottom of this . There 's now ample evidence that Hardy Rodenstock is a con man , and that the Jefferson bottles were fakes . But for those 20 years , an unbelievable number of really eminent and accomplished figures in the wine world were sort of drawn into the orbit of these bottles . I think they wanted to believe that the most expensive bottle of wine in the world must be the best bottle of wine in the world , must be the rarest bottle of wine in the world . I became increasingly , kind of voyeuristically interested in the question of you know , why do people spend these crazy amounts of money , not only on wine but on lots of things , and are they living a better life than me ? So , I decided to embark on a quest . With the generous backing of a magazine I write for sometimes , I decided to sample the very best , or most expensive , or most coveted item in about a dozen categories , which was a very grueling quest , as you can imagine . ( Laughter ) This was the first one . A lot of the Kobe beef that you see in the U. S. is not the real thing . It may come from Wagyu cattle , but it 's not from the original , Appalachian Hyogo Prefecture in Japan . There are very few places in the U. S. where you can try real Kobe , and one of them is Wolfgang Puck's restaurant , CUT , in Los Angeles . I went there , and I ordered the eight-ounce rib eye for 160 dollars . And it arrived , and it was tiny . And I was outraged . It was like , 160 dollars for this ? And then I took a bite , and I wished that it was tinier , because Kobe beef is so rich . It 's like foie gras -- it 's not even like steak . I almost could n ' t finish it . I was really happy when I was done . ( Laughter ) Now , the photographer who took the pictures for this project for some reason posed his dog in a lot of them , so that 's why you 're going to see this recurring character . Which , I guess , you know , communicates to you that I did not think that one was really worth the price . White truffles . One of the most expensive luxury foods by weight in the world . To try this , I went to a Mario Batali restaurant in Manhattan -- Del Posto . The waiter , you know , came out with the white truffle knob and his shaver , and he shaved it onto my pasta and he said , you know , "" Would Signore like the truffles ? "" And the charm of white truffles is in their aroma . It 's not in their taste , really . It 's not in their texture . It 's in the smell . These white pearlescent flakes hit the noodles , this haunting , wonderful , nutty , mushroomy smell wafted up . 10 seconds passed and it was gone . And then I was left with these little ugly flakes on my pasta that , you know , their purpose had been served , and so I 'm afraid to say that this was also a disappointment to me . There were several -- several of these items were disappointments . ( Laughter ) Yeah . The magazine would n ' t pay for me to go there . ( Laughter ) They did give me a tour , though . And this hotel suite is 4,300 square feet . It has 360-degree views . It has four balconies . It was designed by the architect I. M. Pei . It comes with its own Rolls Royce and driver . It comes with its own wine cellar that you can draw freely from . When I took the tour , it actually included some Opus One , I was glad to see . 30,000 dollars for a night in a hotel . This is soap that 's made from silver nanoparticles , which have antibacterial properties . I washed my face with this this morning in preparation for this . And it , you know , tickled a little bit and it smelled good , but I have to say that nobody here has complimented me on the cleanliness of my face today . ( Laughter ) But then again , nobody has complimented me on the jeans I 'm wearing . These ones GQ did spring for -- I own these -- but I will tell you , not only did I not get a compliment from any of you , I have not gotten a compliment from anybody in the months that I have owned and worn these . I do n't think that whether or not you 're getting a compliment should be the test of something's value , but I think in the case of a fashion item , an article of clothing , that 's a reasonable benchmark . That said , a lot of work goes into these . They are made from handpicked organic Zimbabwean cotton that has been shuttle loomed and then hand-dipped in natural indigo 24 times . But no compliments . ( Laughter ) Thank you . Armando Manni is a former filmmaker who makes this olive oil from an olive that grows on a single slope in Tuscany . And he goes to great lengths to protect the olive oil from oxygen and light . He uses tiny bottles , the glass is tinted , he tops the olive oil off with an inert gas . And he actually -- once he releases a batch of it , he regularly conducts molecular analyses and posts the results online , so you can go online and look at your batch number and see how the phenolics are developing , and , you know , gauge its freshness . I did a blind taste test of this with 20 people and five other olive oils . It tasted fine . It tasted interesting . It was very green , it was very peppery . But in the blind taste test , it came in last . The olive oil that came in first was actually a bottle of Whole Foods 365 olive oil which had been oxidizing next to my stove for six months . ( Laughter ) A recurring theme is that a lot of these things are from Japan -- you 'll start to notice . I do n't play golf , so I could n ' t actually road test these , but I did interview a guy who owns them . Even the people who market these clubs -- I mean , they 'll say these have four axis shafts which minimize loss of club speed and thereby drive the ball farther -- but they 'll say , look , you know , you 're not getting 57,000 dollars worth of performance from these clubs . You 're paying for the bling , that they 're encrusted with gold and platinum . The guy who I interviewed who owns them did say that he 's gotten a lot of pleasure out of them , so ... Oh , yeah , you know this one ? This is a coffee made from a very unusual process . The luwak is an Asian Palm Civet . It 's a cat that lives in trees , and at night it comes down and it prowls the coffee plantations . And apparently it 's a very picky eater and it , you know , homes in on only the ripest coffee cherries . And then an enzyme in its digestive tract leeches into the beans , and people with the unenviable job of collecting these cats' leavings then go through the forest collecting the , you know , results and processing it into coffee -- although you actually can buy it in the unprocessed form . That 's right . Unrelatedly -- ( Laughter ) Japan is doing crazy things with toilets . ( Laughter ) There is now a toilet that has an MP3 player in it . There 's one with a fragrance dispenser . There 's one that actually analyzes the contents of the bowl and transmits the results via email to your doctor . It 's almost like a home medical center -- and that is the direction that Japanese toilet technology is heading in . This one does not have those bells and whistles , but for pure functionality it 's pretty much the best -- the Neorest 600 . And to try this -- I could n ' t get a loaner , but I did go into the Manhattan showroom of the manufacturer , Toto , and they have a bathroom off of the showroom that you can use , which I used . It 's fully automated -- you walk towards it , and the seat lifts . The seat is preheated . There 's a water jet that cleans you . There 's an air jet that dries you . You get up , it flushes by itself . The lid closes , it self-cleans . Not only is it a technological leap forward , but I really do believe it 's a bit of a cultural leap forward . I mean , a no hands , no toilet paper toilet . And I want to get one of these . ( Laughter ) This was another one I could not get a loaner of . Tom Cruise supposedly owns this bed . There 's a little plaque on the end that , you know , each buyer gets their name engraved on it . ( Laughter ) To try this one , the maker of it let me and my wife spend the night in the Manhattan showroom . Lights glaring in off the street , and we had to hire a security guard and all these things . But anyway , we had a great night's sleep . And you spend a third of your life in bed . I do n't think it 's that bad of a deal . ( Laughter ) This was a fun one . This is the fastest street-legal car in the world and the most expensive production car . I got to drive this with a chaperone from the company , a professional race car driver , and we drove around the canyons outside of Los Angeles and down on the Pacific Coast Highway . And , you know , when we pulled up to a stoplight the people in the adjacent cars kind of gave us respectful nods . And it was really amazing . It was such a smooth ride . Most of the cars that I drive , if I get up to 80 they start to rattle . I switched lanes on the highway and the driver , this chaperone , said , "" You know , you were just going 110 miles an hour . "" And I had no idea that I was one of those obnoxious people you occasionally see weaving in and out of traffic , because it was just that smooth . And if I was a billionaire , I would get one . ( Laughter ) This is a completely gratuitous video I 'm just going to show of one of the pitfalls of advanced technology . This is Tom Cruise arriving at the "" Mission : Impossible III "" premiere . When he tries to open the door , you could call it "" Mission : Impossible IV . "" There was one object that I could not get my hands on , and that was the 1947 Cheval Blanc . The ' 47 Cheval Blanc is probably the most mythologized wine of the 20th century . And Cheval Blanc is kind of an unusual wine for Bordeaux in having a significant percentage of the Cabernet Franc grape . And 1947 was a legendary vintage , especially in the right bank of Bordeaux . And just together , that vintage and that chateau took on this aura that eventually kind of gave it this cultish following . But it 's 60 years old . There 's not much of it left . What there is of it left you do n't know if it 's real -- it 's considered to be the most faked wine in the world . Not that many people are looking to pop open their one remaining bottle for a journalist . So , I 'd about given up trying to get my hands on one of these . I 'd put out feelers to retailers , to auctioneers , and it was coming up empty . And then I got an email from a guy named Bipin Desai . Bipin Desai is a UC Riverside theoretical physicist who also happens to be the preeminent organizer of rare wine tastings , and he said , "" I 've got a tasting coming up where we 're going to serve the ' 47 Cheval Blanc . "" And it was going to be a double vertical -- it was going to be 30 vintages of Cheval Blanc , and 30 vintages of Yquem . And it was an invitation you do not refuse . I went . It was three days , four meals . And at lunch on Saturday , we opened the ' 47 . And you know , it had this fragrant softness , and it smelled a little bit of linseed oil . And then I tasted it , and it , you know , had this kind of unctuous , porty richness , which is characteristic of that wine -- that it sort of resembles port in a lot of ways . There were people at my table who thought it was , you know , fantastic . There were some people who were a little less impressed . And I was n ' t that impressed . And I do n't -- call my palate a philistine palate -- so it does n ' t necessarily mean something that I was n ' t impressed , but I was not the only one there who had that reaction . And it was n ' t just to that wine . Any one of the wines served at this tasting , if I 'd been served it at a dinner party , it would have been , you know , the wine experience of my lifetime , and incredibly memorable . But drinking 60 great wines over three days , they all just blurred together , and it became almost a grueling experience . And I just wanted to finish by mentioning a very interesting study which came out earlier this year from some researchers at Stanford and Caltech . And they gave subjects the same wine , labeled with different price tags . A lot of people , you know , said that they liked the more expensive wine more -- it was the same wine , but they thought it was a different one that was more expensive . But what was unexpected was that these researchers did MRI brain imaging while the people were drinking the wine , and not only did they say they enjoyed the more expensively labeled wine more -- their brain actually registered as experiencing more pleasure from the same wine when it was labeled with a higher price tag . Thank you . </content> </doc>

612,A11,"This is the first time I have ever shared this with another human being , so it is not easy for me . I keep thinking , I am different . I am not like the others ... although perhaps I am , except I pull my hair from my head and not my eyebrows or eyelashes . Oh , this is so hard but good to have someone I hope will not think I am silly or I am going mad !!! I can remember the day I started , vividly , why I do n't know , maybe some sort of turning point in my life at the age of ten . During my teenage years while going to high school it got to the point of having bald patches behind my ears . I got my hair cut to hide it , as we always had to have out hair up and you could see the bald spots clearly . I do n't remember my parents or anybody else saying anything to me about this , they were always too busy and did n't understand . I am now 48 , never got on with my parents and ran away from home when I was 14 , never went back till I was over 21 . I have never lived at home and can only stand a day there . I find it comes and goes , depending what happens in my life . I believe stress is a big factor . When I gave up smoking several years ago I had nothing to do with my hands so I took up hair pulling again , biting my nails and the skin around them . It 's worse when I am watching TV or not busy with my hands and when I have time to sit and do nothing , boredom . I usually head for the fridge or pull my hair out . Something - I am not sure what , must be happening in my life as in the last few years my weight has ballooned and my hair pulling has been bad in the last few months . I have been dieting and have now lost a lot but have been very very unhappy for a long time . I was never sexually abused by my parents , emotionally I would say , yes . When my parents spoke of their life as children I can now understand why they were like the way there were , always aloof and just out of reach . I always thought I was strange and I did something really weird , I had no idea there was a name for it until one night they featured one brave lady on a current affairs program about pulling her hair out , then I knew . Once , while I was at the doctors with my children I asked him about trichtillomania because I had heard people who have it do the same as I did , he told me not to be so silly , how could I have ADD and did I really think at my age I had it and did I want to start on all these drugs , with no cure . Obviously , that really put me off , I felt like a real idiot . That was years ago , my children are grown up now . THEN , last night because my hair pulling has been so bad in the last month I and I was at my witts end what to do , I do n't know why but I decided to type in ' pulling your hair out and eating it "" on my computer and bingo ! I could n't believe my eyes when all this info came up on your website and I could see with my own eyes that I am not alone after all these years ! I can stop it when I really try . I tell my hands not to do it and try not to think about it and it is very hard but the urge goes away in the end . Sometimes I can be pull free for months at a time then I think ' oh I have n't done that for ages and bang away it goes again ' that 's the way I describe it anyway . It is not an easy thing to accept there is something wrong with you . I have been through all the phyciatrists when I was younger , as I can not relate emotionally to my parents or children . When my Dad died last year I could not shed a tear and still can not . My Mum can not still tell me she loves me , even though I say it to spite her . Since I have grown older I have eventually been able to come to terms with the way I am and now have my ways to get around things . I am a very happy , strong , bubbly , outgoing , person on the outside but a very miserable person on the inside , with all these problems I hide very well . THANK YOU , THANK YOU !! </doc>

1282,A16,"Do you remember the debut of Napster ? Say goodbye to cds and tape cassettes ( for those that still had that feature installed in their cars ) . With the invention of Napster , music was made available for free simply by streaming the music to shared folders on the computer . The age of digital music was born overnight . Napster exploded rapidly across the United States and around the world . The younger computer advance generation could not stream fast enough their favorite artist's music to their personal music libraries . Napster was great . Who wo n't like obtaining music for free ? Well , the musicians , their agents and recording companies did not like it one bit . How would you like working for free ? Essentially Napster stole all their profits by generously making their music available to everyone without charging them a dime . Naturally , the music industry fought back . Napster was clearly violating copyright infringement laws protected under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act . Napster eventually lost the case and was forced to shut down in 2001 after not being able to comply with the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruling to block access of 100 % of infringing material when notified of that material's location on Napster's shared files . Napster may have shut down , but the age of digital music streaming did not . In the past few years other digital music streaming companies have emerged . Pandora and Spotify are both popular music streaming services . Each of these companies still offers free music to their members . Have you ever wondered how these companies are able to offer you music for free like Napster did without running into the same legal trouble as Napster ? The difference between their companies and Napster is that these companies pay the artists per song stream . In order for the artist's music to be made available to members , they need to first negotiate licensing agreements with the artist . The licensing agreements are based on monthly revenue , how many streams per month , how well known of an artist , and what country the stream is coming from . All these variables come into play when determining licensing terms . How then do these companies make money ? The model for generating money for these companies is the same . The companies let advertisers promote radio commercials onto their service in exchange for payment . Members who opt to receive the free basic membership are subjected to commercials periodically after several songs are played . If members wish to pay for an upgraded membership that allows them to listen to music without interruption of commercials , then these members pay an annual membership fee . This also helps contribute to the company's overall revenue . The digital music streaming business is constantly changing . As the technology advances and new applications are incorporated , the licensing agreements will need to evolve as well . </doc>

1146,A17,"The Grinning Man , Bristol Old Vic , review : ' blackly comic brilliance ' G iven the phenomenal worldwide success of Les Miserables , it 's surprising how few of Victor Hugo ' s novels have been cannibalised and turned into musicals . Aside from Disney's relatively recent screen-to-stage version of The Hunchback of Notre Dame , which did n't really go places , there has n't been much . Now , though , as part of Bristol Old Vic's 250th anniversary season , comes a very free adaptation of L ' Homme qui rit ( 1869 ) , a work written by Hugo while he was living in exile on the Channel Islands . A ghoulish tale of a man whose mouth was carved into a permanent smile as a child , it has been adapted before , mostly for the screen : a 1928 silent version was credited with inspiring the Joker in Batman while Gerard Depardieu starred in a 2012 French adaptation as Ursus , the mountebank who has turned the grinning Gwynplaine into a freak side-show attraction to keep them in body and soul . The Old Vic's account has been five years in development and has had £ 370 , 000 poured into it . Directed by Tom Morris , a driving force behind War Horse , the hope must be that they 're onto a winner . Louis Maskell as Grinpayne Credit : Simon Annand I wish I could cheer The Grinning Man straight into the West End but my response is the critical equivalent of a natural smile-for-camera that turns into a pained grimace . At its best , it displays a blackly comic brilliance and inventive daring that 's a joy to behold ; at its worst , it feels like rambling , convoluted storytelling that craves parental levels of indulgence , like Tim Burton on an off-day . At almost three hours , it starts to flag . Adaptor Carl Grose has shifted the action from the original setting of Queen Anne-era England and relocated it to a more period-fluid and fictionalised Bristol – the whole thing exquisitely rendered by designer Jon Bausor , converting the proscenium arch itself into a bloodied rictus grin . Our host for the evening is the cadaverous clown-figure of Barkilphedro , miserable resident goon at the court of King Clarence . He 's played with creeping , leering , frighten-the-kiddies aplomb by Julian Bleach ( a tour de force to match his treasured turn in the runaway hit "" junk opera "" Shockheaded Peter ) . Julian Bleach as Barkilphedro Credit : Simon Annand W ith tattered ruff and tipsy bearing , Barkilphedro introduces us to Clarence's three children – one of whom will become the sour-faced queen , the other two , Lord David and Duchess Josiana , will become enchanted by the scar-faced hero , now renamed Grinpayne . How this benighted youth ( sporting ear-to-ear bloodied bandage for much of the time by Louis Maskell ) came to suffer his disfigurement is told in flashback form in the circus-show within the show , using a boy-puppet and shadow-play . But is that version of events reliable ? Grinpayne's suffering is alleviated by a special potion that fogs his memory . We gradually discover more about Ursus , the pretty blind girl he 's also got in tow ( Audrey Brisson's Dea ) and Barkilphedro's sinister hand in everything . The heart of this "" cracked fairytale "" has pertinent points to make about psychological as well as physical abuse , the restrictive stories children are told about themselves , but the knotty plotting can leave you more bothered than bewitched . Musically , though , the piece ( composed by Tim Phillips and Marc Teitler , performed live ) shows tremendous promise . At times it hits chilling highs reminiscent of Sondheim ' s Sweeney Todd , at other points resembling more conventional musical fare , even getting a touch Les Mis-like . The cruelty and macabre wit needs more continuity , but that sweet-sour contradiction just about works . With some sharp trimming , the whole thing could fly . And any show that closes its first half with a maniacal choral number ( celebrating the anti-hero's bizarre newfound messianic appeal ) called A Scar is Born has got to be worth a look . </doc>

471,A4,"I have always been fascinated by the 21st century . I wish I had lived then - in the Golden Age , before London drowned . Before robots thought they could think . I have an old map of the London Tube from that distant past . Those words of Dr Webber - ' Jubilee , Bakerloo and Circle ' . They are old Tube lines . They all go through Baker Street . That tunnel where Webber's prisoners were trapped had pictures of Sherlock Holmes on the tiles . Holmes lived in Baker Street . Also , when we tried to swim into Baker Street station , the platforms had been blocked by strange metal walls . We searched the area until we found a tiny , hidden tunnel in the basement of the Planetarium . We climbed into it . It led us deep underground , until we came , at last , to Baker Street Station . I saw the ancient tiles with their pictures of Sherlock Holmes . And I saw forty or fifty people sat still and lifeless , wearing magnet-hats . Three robot guards appeared . Using robot picture language , I asked them how to put the personalities back into the victims' brains . They showed me . There was a slot inside each magnet-hat where the crystal fitted .

12,A1,"Hollywood's Favorite Villains Once upon a time , Cold War enemies , white supremacists , and evil geniuses reigned supreme as Hollywood's favorite bad guys . No more . Today , it is multinational corporations that are increasingly being cast as the über-villains of our globalized world . For all their subliminal paid promotions and subtle product placements , corporations are getting drubbed in the main story lines of our popular culture . This treatment goes far beyond documentaries like Michael Moore's polemical Fahrenheit 9 / 11 or The Corporation , an earnest if somewhat paranoid portrayal of multinational companies' role in globalization . It extends to mainstream hits like The Constant Gardener , in which the idealistic protagonists do battle with a malicious global pharmaceutical company that is bent on exploiting Africa's misery to test experimental drugs . To be sure , sociopathic corporations have populated books and films for more than a century . But corporate villains , typically multinational companies , have never been so ubiquitous as today . Is it unfair ? Most corporations , after all , are merely convenient mechanisms for ensuring that scarce global capital is used at maximum efficiency , to the benefit of all . Are famously liberal Hollywood film directors spending too much time going to anti-globalization rallies ? Perhaps . But I would submit that Hollywood's misgivings , however untutored , represent only the tip of a growing iceberg of resentment against the perceived injustices of globalization . The simple truth is that corporations represent capital , and capital – in the form of factories , equipment , machines , money , and even houses – has been the single biggest winner in the modern era of globalization . Corporate profits are bursting at the seams of investors' expectations in virtually every corner of the world . Even in moribund economies like Germany and Italy , where employment security is vanishing , corporations are swimming in cash . This phenomenon comes as no surprise to economists . Add two billion Indian and Chinese workers to the global labor force , and the value of other means of production – particularly capital and commodities ( for example , gold and oil ) – is bound to go up . And so it has , with capitalists everywhere gaining an ever larger share of the economic pie . ( In theory , capitalists in labor-abundant China and India could end up as losers , but in practice they , too , have benefited thanks to their governments' success in simultaneously liberalizing and globalizing . ) Many policymakers seem to be under the impression that surging profits are a purely cyclical phenomenon , as economies continue to grow out from the depths of the 2001 recession . Wait a bit , they predict , and wages will fully catch up later in the cycle . Not likely . Capital's piece of the pie has been getting bigger for more than 20 years , and the trend looks set to continue . Indeed , corporations' growing share of income has been a major driver behind the long , if uneven , bull market in stocks that began in the early 1990's . At the same time , inflation-adjusted wages for rich-country unskilled workers have barely budged over the last two decades . Some of these trends also have to do with the nature of modern technological change , which seems to favor capital and skilled workers disproportionately . But , regardless of their cause , rapidly growing inequalities are a powerful force for instability everywhere , from wealthy America to rapidly growing China to reform-challenged Europe . "" A rising tide lifts all boats , "" conservatives like to say . Fine , but what happens to people , like the poor of hurricane-struck New Orleans , who do n't own boats ? Growing inequality would not be such a problem if governments could simply raise taxes on the rich and strengthen subsidies to the poor . Unfortunately , any country that taxes capital too aggressively will only succeed in chasing it to regions where the tax burden is lighter . In a globalized world , national governments' ability to tax potentially mobile factors of production is sharply circumscribed . The same mechanism that pours profits into the pockets of global corporations also prevents governments from claiming a larger share of the spoils . Unfortunately , the long-term trend towards ever-lower income shares for unskilled workers is likely to continue over the coming decades , as modern technology permeates the globe , and as emerging markets like China , India , Brazil , and Eastern Europe continue to integrate into global production . This is not to say that unskilled workers are actually being made worse off by globalization in absolute terms ; the vast majority are actually breaking even or better . But unskilled workers' incomes are not keeping pace with overall economic growth , and the resulting social strains are a ticking bomb . If so , then Hollywood's cartoon-like caricatures of evil multinational corporations may some day seize mainstream consciousness , leading to political upheavals that shatter today's social contract . That wo n't be good for profits , or for the poor . Governments – and corporations – must find better ways to provide equal opportunity through improved education , broader financial markets , and other channels . Otherwise , globalization's storyline may not proceed according to the script . </doc>

241,A1,"Commission on Enterprise , Business Facilitation and Development Seventh session Geneva , 24-28 February 2003 Item 6 of the provisional agenda progress report on the implementation of the agreed conclusions and recommendations of the commission at its sixth session , including post-doha follow-up Prepared by the UNCTAD secretariat Executive summary The note on "" Improving the functioning and the structure of the intergovernmental machinery of UNCTAD "" ( TD / B / EX ( 24 ) / L. 1 ) , re-endorsed by the Trade and Development Board at its twenty-sixth executive session on 10 April 2001 , stated inter alia : "" Starting with the second session of each Commission , the fifth day of the session will be used for policy reviews of implementation by member States and the secretariat of the outcome of previous sessions , on the basis of documentation produced by the secretariat "" . Accordingly , the secretariat has prepared the present report , which contains information on the implementation of agreed conclusions and recommendations adopted at the sixth session of the Commission on Enterprise , Business Facilitation and Development and addressed to UNCTAD . The report covers three areas : electronic commerce and international transport services , competitiveness of SMEs and gender . The section on international transport services and electronic commerce highlights best practices in these interrelated fields for enhancing the competitiveness of developing countries . The section on competitiveness of SMEs takes a closer look at financial innovations for improving SME access to finance , including e-finance . The section on gender looks at mainstreaming gender in order to promote opportunities . The report deals also with the implications for the work of the Commission following the Doha Ministerial Meeting . Electronic commerce and international transport services : Best practices for enhancing the competitiveness of developing countries 3 Improving the competitiveness of SMEs in developing countries : Role of finance , including e-finance , to enhance enterprise development 6 Mainstreaming gender in order to promote opportunities 10 Implications for the work of the Commission following the Doha Ministerial Meeting 13 The report of the Commission on Enterprise , Business Facilitation and Development on its sixth session ( TD / B / COM . 3 / 46 ) contained a number of recommendations for action by UNCTAD . It also included agreed conclusions on the implications for the work of the Commission following the Doha Ministerial Meeting . These recommendations and agreed conclusions are set out below , together with the relevant action taken so far . Following the recommendations of the Commission at its fifth session , the secretariat undertook a series of actions . Recommendation UNCTAD should keep under review and monitor developments relating to economic , commercial , legal and infrastructure aspects of electronic commerce affecting international transport services , and analyse the implications thereof for developing countries , and furthermore collect and disseminate this information to member countries . Action The secretariat continued monitoring and analysing developments at the international level relating to economic , commercial and legal aspects of electronic commerce having a particular impact on international transport services , and disseminated the information to member countries through its recurrent publications such as the Review of Maritime Transport and the Transport Newsletter . In addition , information was disseminated through presentations at various regional and national seminars . One of the most important developments concerning legal aspects of electronic commerce is the on-going work in the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law ( UNCITRAL ) on the preparation of a new draft international instrument on transport law , which was reported in the Review of Maritime Transport 2002 . The draft instrument envisages the use of "" electronic record "" as well as paper transport documents and grants equal legal status to electronic communications as paper documents . The draft is still in its preliminary stages and if / when agreement on a new international instrument is reached it will provide an important step in removing legal barriers to further development of international transport . The UNCTAD secretariat is continuing to make a major substantive contribution to the work carried out under the auspices of UNCITRAL . In particular , it has provided a detailed analytical commentary on the draft , which is published by UNCITRAL as one of the two working documents of its Working Group ( A / CN . 9 / WG . III / WP . 21 / Add . 1 ; UNCTAD / SDTE / TLB / 4 ) . Recommendation UNCTAD should undertake studies on the use of traditional transport documents in international trade , particularly the extent to which negotiable bills of lading are necessary for modern-day international trade , and the extent to which they can be replaced by non-negotiable transport documents , such as sea waybills , and by electronic alternatives . Action In order to implement this recommendation the secretariat is in the process of conducting a study concerning the use of various transport documents , including negotiable and non-negotiable documents as well as electronic alternatives . To that end , a questionnaire has been widely distributed to interested parties involved in international trade and transport , including providers and users of transport , intermediaries , banks , insurers and members of the legal profession . The replies received will be reflected in a report , which will be submitted to the Commission at its next session and will also be fed into ongoing discussions at the international level aimed at preparing the necessary framework conditions for paperless trading . Recommendation UNCTAD should develop and deliver training materials , where appropriate , and disseminate information on best practices in the field of electronic commerce and international transport services for developing countries in cooperation with relevant public and private sector organizations . Action In the context of the TrainForTrade regional project "" Capacity building in the fields of transport and international trade "" ( RAF / 99 / A09 ) , the secretariat has prepared a course on multimodal transport and logistics . This course covers various elements related to electronic commerce and international transport services . In particular , it contains a module on logistics that emphasizes the essential role of information in the context of freight transport management . New challenges are described , highlighting that proper cargo tracking is a prerequisite for efficient and secure cargo movement . The module introduces the basic features of logistics system management . It refers to the use of new technologies such as electronic data interchange , the Internet and modern operational planning techniques applied in supply-chain management . It shows that information management is becoming an essential part of any industrial development . The International Institute for the Management of Logistics ( IML ) of the Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne ( EPFL ) developed this module on logistics and one IML academic staff member participated in the first delivery of the course in Bamako ( June 2001 ) . This contribution is the first demonstration of the commitment made by the EPFL during the Transport Session of the Third United Nations Conferences on the Least Developed Countries ( Brussels , May 2001 ) . The EPFL had offered to contribute to transport management training for LDCs through special programmes , scholarships and dedicated research on topics proposed by LDCs ( See A / CONF . 191 / 13 , P. 84 ) . In order to implement this recommendation the secretariat contacted a number of port authorities with experience in setting up electronic platforms to exchange data between members of the port community belonging to the public and private sectors . APEC , the training institution of the Antwerp Port Authority , hosted a two-day session in late March 2002 for a number of port experts to prepare an outline for a course on Information and communications technology in port communities . Experts from Indonesia and Spain complemented expertise from the port of Antwerp and the neighbouring port of Ghent . Two members of the UNCTAD secretariat also contributed to the session . The secretariat has continued with the next phase of the procedure for course development in collaboration with the port of Valencia ( Spain ) , which has features in common with those found in ports of developing countries . Information on best practices in electronic commerce and international transport services has been disseminated through UNCTAD's recurrent publications , such as the E-commerce and Development Report and the Transport Newsletter . The importance of logistics for order fulfilment is discussed in chapter 8 of the E-commerce and Development Report . The development of Internet-based portals for shipping services , the use of mobile phones for transmitting SMS messages regarding vessel arrival and for trucking operators , and the use of an e-mart to reduce repositioning costs of empty containers are some of the developments discussed in the Transport Newsletter . Recommendation UNCTAD should prepare guidelines for the establishment of model port community systems and logistics platforms in developing countries . Action The secretariat analysed a number of port community systems and is in the process of preparing preliminary guidelines based on its findings . A port community system is one that allows the electronic exchange of information amongst the port community . This implies that the port community must have the capability to send , receive and process information electronically . Most of the port community systems have been developed and are operated by an independent organization specifically established for this purpose by the port community . In general , users pay an annual subscription fee plus a charge for each transaction . The core function of the system is to allow the exchange of information by EDIFACT or XML messages . Some systems maintain data files such as dangerous cargo lists . The port authority has been one of the key players . In Singapore , the community system has been developed and is operated by a fully owned subsidiary of PSA Corporation ; it focuses on services provided by the port as well as exchanging messages within the community . One of the most important actors in the community is the customs administration , as it controls the release of goods . Most community systems have been developed to interface with customs systems that imply that customs have a computerized system . UNCTAD's technical cooperation work in customs reform is creating the capacity in customs administrations to exchange information electronically with the port community and thus facilitate the development of port community systems . IMPROVING THE COMPETITIVENESS OF SMEs IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES : ROLE OF FINANCE , INCLUDING E-FINANCE , TO ENHANCE ENTERPRISE DEVELOPMENT Recommendation UNCTAD should , through its Intergovernmental Working Group of Experts on International Standards of Accounting and Reporting , complete its work on a user-friendly accounting framework for small and medium-sized enterprises ( SMEs ) that will allow them to produce transparent , reliable and uniform financial and business information , and report back to the Commission as soon as possible . Action Since the last session of the Commission , the Intergovernmental Working Group of Experts on International Standards of Accounting and Reporting has completed drafting its guidelines for accounting by SMEs . It deliberated on the proposed guidelines at its nineteenth session , held in Geneva from 25 to 27 September 2002 . The final guidelines are expected to be issued in the near future once wider consultation on the drafts has been completed . Recommendation UNCTAD should strengthen its technical corporation programmes for entrepreneurship , including where appropriate in cooperation with the International Trade Centre in order to improve meaningfully the creditworthiness of SMEs by linking its business development services to financial services through partnerships between national programmes such as the Entrepreneurship Development Programme ( EMPRETEC ) and banks . Action During 2002 , UNCTAD responded to requests by countries for assistance in improving SME access to finance , including by combining financial services with business services . After the relevant stakeholders in the SME and financial communities had been interviewed , workshops were held or planned to permit a public-private sector dialogue on how market failure could be resolved . In the case of Uganda these activities resulted in the establishment of a plan of action and a task force headed by the Ugandan Bankers Association and the Bank of Uganda . A set of recommendations was sent to the Minister of Finance , Planning and Economic Development for immediate action . It is expected that Enterprise Uganda ( EMPRETEC ) , as a member of the task force , will pursue the idea of concluding partnerships with various banks , assisting them in identifying creditworthy SMEs . A request from the Romanian Minister for SMEs made possible an initial assessment of the situation of SMEs and the willingness of the banking community to service them . The European Commission will also begin to assist in facilitating SME access to finance . At the EMPRETEC Directors Meeting , held from 9 to 11 October 2002 , a session was devoted to experiences combining financial and non-financial services . EMPRETEC Ghana is the most advanced , with six different initiatives . Given the complex nature of these initiatives , it has decided to create a finance company - the EMPRETEC Finance Company - to manage them and is seeking a licence . Recommendation UNCTAD should monitor the development of new products and innovative financial mechanisms pertinent to the EMPRETEC programme so that participants can more easily access them , including environmentally and socially responsible investment funds . Action During 2002 , UNCTAD continued its research on best practices in financial innovations for SMEs , focusing more on mechanisms to finance technology . The results of this work are contained in the issues note "" Financing technology for SMEs "" and the background paper "" Providing finance for technology-based SMEs "" . For example , SMEloan Hong Kong ( China ) has introduced new appraisal and monitoring methods for lending based on information that is relatively easily obtained from SMEs , such as who their customers are , how much business they do and how much cash they will collect . The SMEloan model analyses the triangular relationship between cash flows , sales and accounts receivable . It uses the Internet to obtain cash flow information on a real-time basis , thus reducing loan-servicing tasks and costs . The Expert Meeting on Improving the Competitiveness of SMEs through Enhancing Productive Capacity : Financing Technology was held from 28 to 30 October 2002 . The experts considered national policies and programmes in both the public and private sectors to finance the technology that SMEs need in order to compete in the global economy . EMPRETEC Ghana has developed a number of services to facilitate access to finance . Its most profitable service is training bank loan officers how to evaluate SME risks . It also has a $ 700 , 000 revolving loan programme funded by the United Nations Development Programme ( UNDP ) that does not require collateral . It started a mutual loan guarantee association ( MEGA ) with donor assistance support whereby Empretecos in the scheme can borrow up to six times what they have deposited with the bank . EMPRETEC is managing part of the national export development investment fund , thereby facilitating SMEs' participation in it . It has signed a memorandum of understanding with a leasing company whereby it submits applications , provides consultancy services to those SMEs selected and receives a percentage of the leasing fee in return . It has set up credit sourcing services in four of its regional centres to assist Empretecos ; this lowers interest rates and increases loan maturities over what SMEs could obtain on their own . Another example is the EMPRETEC centre in Colombia , which has an agreement with the national credit guarantee agency whereby it certifies EMPRETEC business plans . When submitted to the participating banks , these business plans are accepted as the 80 per cent collateral requirement . Recommendation UNCTAD should continue its work on business linkages , including interfirm cooperation and partnerships , as one of the most efficient ways to access finance , technology , skills and markets . Actions UNCTAD has elaborated a project proposal to assist Governments that wish to start or strengthen linkage programmes in their countries . It consists of policy advice and capacity building so that SMEs are partnership-ready . It also describes the most effective mentoring and coaching programmes that would have to be put in place by the large enterprises . On the basis of this proposal , Uganda has obtained donor funding to start a pilot programme in 2003 . In addition , a linkage component was added to the women entrepreneurs programme , funding for which was provided by the German Government at the Third United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries . UNCTAD also assisted Sebrae in organizing a roundtable on business linkages during the Inter-American Development Bank's Micro Forum in Brazil , which was attended by over 3,000 SMEs , government officials and support agencies . The roundtable featured presentations by transnational corporations ( TNCs ) on their linkage programmes ; during the roundtable they committed themselves to working with Brazilian chief executive officers to help them design similar programmes . Lastly , as a follow-up to the World Investment Report 2001 , which featured linkage programmes in 14 countries , a video was produced on best practices in Penang , Malaysia . The purpose of the video is to demonstrate to the public and private sectors exactly how the process works and how to make it most effective in terms of its positive impact on growth , development and competitiveness . The video showcases the roles played by all the partners - Government , SME support agencies and the TNCs themselves . According to the Chief Minister of Penang , such partnerships have been an important component in Malaysia's growth and development . During the annual meeting of the World Association of SMEs in Changzhou , China , held from 19 to 21 September 2002 , a member of the secretariat chaired a panel session and made a presentation on business linkages . The Committee of Donor Agencies for SME Development took up the topic of best practices in business linkages at its annual meeting in Turin , Italy from 16 to 18 September 2002 . It decided to form a small working group headed by UNCTAD to discuss guidelines for donor interventions in this field . A number of multilateral and bilateral agencies have started programmes , and there is a huge diversity in the types of activities undertaken and their impacts . At the Symposium on the United Nations Global Compact and Swiss Business , held in Geneva on 29 October 2002 and co-organised by UNCTAD , the United Nations Global Compact Office and the Swiss Government , the issue of linkages was stressed as one important channel through which companies , particularly TNCs , can make a contribution to the development of host countries . During the seminar , which was attended by more than 200 representatives of Swiss business ( mostly SMEs themselves ) , one of the five parallel workshops in the afternoon was specifically dedicated to the subject of linkages . At the meeting of the Investment Advisory Council held in Johannesburg on 31 August 2002 during the World Summit on Sustainable Development , special attention was given to private sector development , especially SMEs . It was acknowledged that SME-TNC linkages could be powerful channels for diffusing knowledge and skills between firms . To achieve these linkages , UNCTAD was encouraged to help SMEs to become partnership-ready through its SME capacity-building programmes . Recommendation UNCTAD should incorporate the aspects of e-finance and e-commerce that are more relevant to the needs of SMEs into UNCTAD technical cooperation activities and ensure coordination and synergies with other international organizations active in this field . Action The results of UNCTAD's research work and papers presented by e-finance experts at UNCTAD events are widely available to users worldwide through the UNCTAD website . Many other international organizations , including development banks , use those materials when organizing their training and other events in cooperation with UNCTAD . In December 2002 the World Bank organized a conference on "" new technologies for small and medium-size enterprise finance "" with the active participation of UNCTAD and with UNCTAD materials providing most of the background reading . Elements of e-finance are increasingly being incorporated into the activities of Trade Points . The Trade Point Programme was officially transferred to the World Trade Point Federation on 4 November 2002 , with UNCTAD still providing support to its secretariat , as well as capacity building for Trade Points . In October 2002 , the Federation signed a partnership agreement with one of the main credit insurance and credit rating providers , Coface . Under this agreement , Coface grants the Federation and its clients access to its international credit rating ( @ rating ) services through the Federation's website . This service aims at building trust in international trade transactions concluded by Trade Point client companies and increasing the international credibility of these companies . UNCTAD's EMPRETEC programme is exploring the possibility of incorporating an e-commerce training module in its menu of products and services , but interest among users is low , as is the case for most SMEs . Recommendation UNCTAD should organize regular forums , including regional seminars and group training , to sensitize Governments , central banks , financial service providers and the corporate sector in developing and transition countries to the advantages of electronic finance at the local , regional and global levels . Action UNCTAD organized a side event entitled "" E-Finance for Development "" in the framework of the International Conference on Financing for Development , convened by the United Nations in Monterrey , Mexico , in March 2002 . This side event was attended by many participants , including representatives of Governments , the private sector , non-governmental organizations and academia . Special e-finance-related sessions were organized at the UNCTAD regional e-commerce workshop in Curaçao , Netherlands Antilles ( June 2002 ) and at the UNCTAD-ESCAP Asia-Pacific regional conference on e-commerce strategies in Bangkok , Thailand ( November 2002 ) . UNCTAD prepared a study entitled "" E-finance for development : Global trends , national experiences and SMEs "" , which was reported at various forums . It became chapter 6 of UNCTAD's E-commerce and Development Report 2002 . The report is posted on the UNCTAD e-commerce website and is expected to be widely used , as the experience with previous reports has proved , by policy makers and business practitioners in developing and transition economies , thus sensitizing them to the importance of the correct policy choices and sequencing , as well as the adoption of best business practices to ensure better SME access to e-finance . Recommendation UNCTAD should encourage Governments , central banks and financial institutions to provide information on e-finance for the purposes of analysis , intergovernmental deliberations and technical cooperation . Action The importance of data on the state of e-finance and the need to undertake capacity building in information gathering and dissemination in that field have been constantly emphasized by UNCTAD publications , as well at the events organized by UNCTAD . Recommendation UNCTAD should mainstream gender in all areas of work , as appropriate . In doing so , a focal point on gender should be identified in each division of UNCTAD , with the responsibility to integrate the gender dimension in all substantive areas of the division , without prejudice to the work of the overall coordination of the focal point on women designated by the Secretary-General . Action Divisional focal points on gender have been nominated in each division of UNCTAD . To ensure that gender mainstreaming goes beyond establishing gender units and gender focal points , the secretariat's follow-up activities have focused on designing , for pilot implementation , capacity-building technical assistance proposals in the areas of gender sensitization for trade policy makers and gender statistics . UNCTAD prepared a background paper for The Least Developed Countries Report 2002 on "" Trade liberalization , gender and rural poverty in African LDCs "" . Its key policy conclusion is that "" rural women will not necessarily benefit from trade liberalization unless there are a range of measures to address the gender-intensified disadvantages and gender-imposed constraints "" . The paper stresses the importance of access to capital in ensuring that women are not excluded from the benefits of economic growth . UNCTAD organized the pre-UNLDC III workshop in Cape Town in March 2001 on "" LDCs : Building capacities to mainstream gender in development strategies "" . Subsequently , UNCTAD with financial support from the Government of Japan and UNDP consolidated all the documentation and the outcome in a publication entitled "" LDCs : Building capacities to mainstream gender in development strategies "" , which was released recently and is being widely distributed . Since one of the major obstacles for rural women in LDCs concerns mobility and lack of access to transport , the secretariat is collaborating with the International Forum on Rural Transport Development in the design and development of a capacity-building technical assistance proposal on "" Making global bicycle markets work for the poor "" to contribute to greater mobility for girls in LDCs . Another example of UNCTAD's work on gender is the close cooperation between the UNCTAD secretariat , which services the Commission on Science and Technology for Development , and the Commission's Gender Advisory Board to ensure that gender remains a cross-cutting issue in the deliberation and outcome of this substantive theme . UNCTAD's Science and Technology for Development Network ( STDev ) ( http://www.unctad.org/stdev ) has also created a space for "" Gender , Science and Technology "" . Here one can find information on the Gender Advisory Board , as well as links to relevant documents on gender . Activities carried out in accordance with more specific recommendations are described below . Recommendation UNCTAD should review its capacity-building programmes , particularly EMPRETEC and MED 2000 , so that they are gender-sensitive and can effectively provide training and advice to improve women entrepreneurs' access to finance , e-finance and e-commerce . Action In the Expert Meeting on Improving the Competitiveness of SMEs in Developing Countries : The Role of Finance , Including E-Finance , to Enhance Enterprise Development "" held in Geneva from 22 to 24 October 2001 , the experts considered the problems faced by women entrepreneurs in obtaining credit and examined successful programmes for improving women's access to finance . They concluded that it is vital to increase the number of women working as advisers and other staff in banks in order to improve banks' awareness of and capability to work with women entrepreneurs . The UNCTAD secretariat has taken the initiative of compiling a database to promote networks of women entrepreneurs and business associations . Moreover , pursuant to paragraph 26 of the "" Report of the Expert Meeting on Mainstreaming Gender in order to Promote Opportunities "" ( TD / B / COM . 3 / 40 ) , a specific training and mentoring programme targeted at women entrepreneurs has been prepared by EMPRETEC El Salvador , with the assistance of EMPRETEC Uruguay , under the supervision of the UNCTAD secretariat . The first workshop for women entrepreneurs took place during the first half of November 2002 . In addition , UNCTAD , together with Enterprise Ethiopia and Enterprise Uganda , launched a project for women entrepreneurs , financed by the Government of Germany , in August 2002 . It seeks to develop gender-sensitive training and business services for women entrepreneurs . It enhances their access to business development services in order to enable them to establish and / or strengthen their SMEs by overcoming obstacles to accessing finance and technology , so that they can survive and compete in increasingly global economies and participate in business linkages with larger companies , for example affiliates of transnational corporations . Recommendation UNCTAD should , in cooperation with the International Telecommunication Union ( ITU ) , ( i ) carry out analytical and case-study-based work on gender and information and communication technologies ( ICT ) , identifying the specific opportunities in the digital economy for women ; ( ii ) develop sex-disaggregated indicators and contribute to the collection of data on ICT and the telecommunications sector in order to identify the impact of ICT on women and women's impact on ICT ; ( iii ) identify policies for mainstreaming gender in national ICT policy-making , including the telecommunications sector , with a view to enhancing the participation of women in the digital economy and thus contributing towards increasing the competitiveness of developing countries ; and ( iv ) develop recommendations on mainstreaming gender in ICT policy for inclusion in the outcome of the World Summit on the Information Society ( WSIS ) , to be held in Geneva in 2003 and in Tunisia in 2005 . Action UNCTAD has prepared a study entitled "" Gender , E-commerce and development "" , which is included as a chapter in the E-commerce and Development Report 2002 . It outlines different opportunities and challenges which women face in the digital economy . It illustrates how ICT enhance business opportunities for self-employed women in developing countries and how they create new employment in ICT-related services industries . It also discusses the main barriers which women have to overcome in order to benefit fully from the new technologies . The study makes a number of policy recommendations for mainstreaming gender in ICT policy , including in policy areas related to enhancing human capacity and training , improving access to telecommunications infrastructure , new technologies and the Internet , providing finance to SMEs and promoting new business opportunities or employment for women in the ICT sector . UNCTAD secretariat staff meet regularly with staff from the ITU secretariat working on ICT and gender . UNCTAD has participated in Geneva-based events on ICT and gender organized by ITU in preparation for the WSIS , and in this context has provided ITU with inputs to the preparation of recommendations on mainstreaming gender in ICT policy-making . As part of its ongoing work on e-commerce strategies , the UNCTAD secretariat included the topic of gender on the agenda of the Expert Meeting on Electric Commerce Strategies for Development ( held in Geneva from 10 to 12 July 2002 ) and the Asia-Pacific regional conference on e-commerce strategies ( held jointly with the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific ( ESCAP ) in Bangkok from 20 to 22 November 2002 ) . Agreed conclusion in the field of trade facilitation With regard to the plan for "" Capacity Building and Technical Cooperation for Developing Countries , especially LDCs , and Economies in Transition in Support of their Participation in the WTO Doha Work Programme "" ( UNCTAD / RMS / TCS / 1 ) , which reflects the specific requirements of the least developed and African countries , the secretariat has initiated a comprehensive work programme in the area of trade facilitation , building on UNCTAD's accumulated experience without negatively affecting its ongoing activities . The work programme would provide , in line with paragraph 27 of the Doha Ministerial Declaration , enhanced technical assistance and capacity building with long-term sustainable impact to further expedite the movement , release and clearance of goods , including goods in transit . This programme would identify the major issues and address policy analysis and development , human resources development and institutional development . It would also identify trade facilitation needs and priorities to allow developing countries to better evaluate the implications of closer multilateral cooperation for their development policies and objectives . Actions Project proposals in the field of trade facilitation In addition to the project proposal included in Part C of document UNCTAD / TCS / RMS / 1 , another project proposal has been prepared for financing by the 4th Tranche of the Development Account . This proposal covers analysis of potential impact of the adoption of binding rules on trade facilitation at WTO . The expected outcome of these projects is to assist in building a consensus among developing countries as to the modalities of future negotiations on trade facilitation rules . The approach underlying these proposals is that the application of international standards for trade facilitation requires tailor-made execution adapted to local frameworks . As opposed to traditional technical assistance based on foreign expertise , long-term capacity building should rely on local and regional know-how . The purpose of this new approach is to guarantee ownership by the beneficiaries and the formation of lasting learning and innovating trade and transport facilitation structures . Local , national and regional facilitation clusters , gathering together private and public sector participants , will be guided to monitor and improve trade and transport corridors , and supply and distribution chains . Capacity building is seen as a multi-layer process , combining institution-building , human resource development and collaborative networks . Extensive use of knowledge management schemes based on ICT is also foreseen where skills can be gained from direct on-the-job learning rather than through individual or group training . The above-mentioned projects will take advantage of the considerable experience accumulated by UNCTAD in trade facilitation through its wide range of analytical work and technical assistance activities that take into account the specificities of developing countries , as well as through the introduction of information technology tools in the areas of cargo tracking ( ACIS ) and customs automation ( ASYCUDA ) . Consensus building The secretariat organized , in November 2002 , an Expert Meeting on Efficient Transportation and Trade Facilitation in the post-Doha context . This meeting was aimed at contributing to a better understanding of current implementation and development issues related to trade facilitation , including security , capacity building and the consequences of the potential adoption of binding rules . Supporting documents for the meeting were prepared . Representatives of the secretariat regularly attend meetings of the WTO's Council for Trade in Goods on trade facilitation , and make adhoc contributions as required ( e . g . the paper on transit issues , presented when Article V ( on freedom of transit ) was discussed ) . In the context of its post-Doha work , taking into account paragraph 27 ( on trade facilitation ) of the Doha Declaration , the secretariat will continue to assist developing countries in identifying their trade facilitation needs and priorities . Training activities The secretariat has undertaken various actions regarding the organization of training activities in the field of trade facilitation . At the request of Austria , a proposal has been formulated to organize - jointly with the United Nations Industrial Development Organization ( UNIDO ) - two workshops ( in Addis Ababa and Ouagadougou ) , plus one high-level meeting ( in Vienna ) , on trade facilitation and trade barriers to trade . For the regional South Asian and Andean Community , a joint proposal has been prepared to hold two workshops covering tariffs and trade facilitation issues . The organization of these workshops has been requested and will be funded by the European Union ( DG Trade ) . In cooperation with ESCAP , a series of seminars on trade facilitation are being designed and will be delivered through the International Institute for Trade and Development in Bangkok . Agreed conclusion in the field of electronic commerce The Commission recognizes the importance of creating and maintaining an environment that is favourable to the future development of electronic commerce , as provided for in paragraph 34 of the Doha Ministerial Declaration . Support is required in order to bridge the digital divide so as to create new opportunities for the expansion of trade . To this end , the Commission stresses the need for strengthened and adequately resourced assistance to respond to those needs , as outlined in document UNCTAD / RMS / TCS / 1 . Actions Expert Meeting UNCTAD held the Expert Meeting on E-Commerce Strategies and Development ( 10-12 July 2002 ) . Up to 100 experts attended the meeting , including many from developing countries and also experts from international organizations such as ITU , the World Bank , the International Labour Organization , UNCITRAL and UNDP , and representatives of G-8's DOT Force and the UN ICT Task Force . The meeting addressed the issue of strategies that developing countries could formulate and implement in order to promote e-commerce and the development of ICT generally . The experiences of developed and developing countries provided the major inputs into the discussion . The focus was on strategies relating to human resources development and training for e-commerce , legal and regulatory issues , and telecommunications , infrastructure and access . The experts recognized that strategies relating to other areas such as e-finance , transport and distribution were equally important . Emphasis was placed on the linkages and interactions between e-commerce strategies and other aspects of national development strategies . Regional seminars on e-commerce Two regional level events were held in 2002 - the High-level Regional Workshop on E-commerce and ICT for Central America and the Caribbean ( Curaçao , 25-27 June ) and the High-level Regional Meeting on E-commerce Strategies for Development , in cooperation with UN / ESCAP ( Bangkok , 20-22 November ) . The two meetings provided an opportunity for ( a ) raising awareness about various aspects of e-commerce and ICT strategies , ( b ) identifying policies and strategies that can create an enabling environment for e-commerce in developing countries , ( c ) supporting national capacity-building in e-strategy making , and ( d ) exchanging information about national and regional experiences regarding e-commerce and ICT . Attention was paid to the issue of developing a participatory approach to national e-commerce strategy making , as well as to regional and global initiatives in support of developing countries . Annual publication The secretariat published its E-commerce and Development Report 2002 . This annual report provides information on major developments in e-commerce of particular interest to developing countries and policy recommendations . It is intended to allow developing countries greater access to knowledge about e-commerce issues and thus contribute to their capacity building and their ability to develop policies and strategies for e-commerce . Other activities The secretariat also carried out other activities , including participating as a member in the UN ICT Task Force and in preparations for the World Summit on the Information Society . Furthermore , it participated in a number of regional and national events in which it provided advisory services in areas such as legal and regulatory issues and e-finance . Agreed conclusion regarding cooperation with international organizations To maximize benefits in the fields of competence of this Commission , UNCTAD is encouraged to continue collaboration with other relevant international organizations , such as the World Trade Organization , the UN regional commissions and specialized institutions , as appropriate . Action The secretariat has been instrumental in the coordination within the UN system in the field of trade facilitation . The High Level Committee on Programmes ( HLCP ) of the UN Executive Board had requested UNCTAD to convene a meeting with a view to identifying trade facilitation issues to be dealt with in a coordinated manner within the agencies members of the HLCP . The meeting took place on 5 April 2002 and resulted in the creation of a cooperative network of multilateral agencies working on trade facilitation issues within the UN system - ILO , the World Trade Organization , the World Bank , the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations , the International Monetary Fund , UNIDO , the Economic Commission for Europe on behalf of the Regional Commissions , the Chief Executives Board Secretariat and UNCTAD . Work on SME promotion is coordinated in the international community by the Committee of Donor Agencies for SME Development . It met in September 2002 in Turin , Italy . UNCTAD is an active member of this Committee and has driven its work forward in two areas : SME finance and business linkages . UNCTAD is also a member of the Working Group of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development on SMEs and participates in it sessions . The Working Group met in December 2002 and is preparing for its ministerial meeting in 2004 . It has two major themes to which UNCTAD is contributing : financing technology and ICT diffusion and use by SMEs .

1378,A1,"Doodle . ly iPad Application Discussing "" thinking graphically "" and the benefits of doodling ( particularly during meetings ) the panel all remarked on the connection between seemingly distracting scribbles and improvements in retaining information . Doug Jaeger , former President of the Art Directors Club and Professor at SVA , remarked that he had recently leafed through his notebooks from high school history and the doodles caused him to remember facts rather than reading the notes themselves . Lance Ulanoff , Editor-in-Chief of Mashable , has brought his doodling to a rarefied level – not only using them as creative tools in his professional responsibilities , but also often including them as integral parts of the articles on Mashable . As a co-founder of Doodle . ly , Evan Vogel clearly sees the desire for a digital representation of the sketchbook that provides and experience as close as possible to the physical one as possible . Within the doodle . ly application , a selection of media ( including pencils , crayons and markers ) takes the experience of drawing on an iPad very close to that ideal . Of the entire panel , Ulanoff was the sole proponent for the use of a stylus for his sketching rather than just using a fingertip , remarking that the muscle-memory from years of drawing made the process uncomfortable without one . Interestingly , he used fingers and gestures when using his tablet for everything else that could be discerned from the audience – confirming that ( for him ) the implement was important , not the medium . Image via CrunchBase Alexis Ohanian , co-Founder of Reddit , revealed that some of his doodles have led the approachable public persona of the companies he has been involved in . The "" Reddit Alien "" for example , started as one of his sketches and evolved into the mascot we know today . The entire session is available online through this Livestream link : Video The Doodle . ly application makes the sharing of sketches and integral part of their creation . The social part of doodling , particularly the communal process , was mentioned as an upcoming improvement to the platform . The panel agreed that the tactile art of sketching need not be lost to the digital environment , but rather can , and should , become an important part of the new social experience .

281,A14,"In producing a signlist and analysing its contents , it is obviously very important to consider the question of what actually constitutes a "" sign "" . Much has changed since the traditional Assyriological signlists were first produced , both in Assyriology and in the description and analysis of writing and writing systems in general . The minimal unit of written language - and this applies equally to logo-syllabic scripts such as cuneiform as it does to alphabetic scripts - is the grapheme . One might describe this as the smallest contrastive unit of writing . By substituting one such unit for another , a significant change in meaning ( using the term in its broad sense ) occurs . Grapheme is not an unproblematic term ( notice , for instance , that there is no one-to-one relationship between graphemes and phonemes ) but it is both defensible and useful , as far as the present study of cuneiform is concerned , at least . There are many and various indications of what ancient scribes considered units in cuneiform ; in light of these , a set of criteria is being drawn up to allow the identification of signs . The CDP project will catalogue and analyse these units , these graphemes . Thus for the signlist , the sign is a grapheme . There are two further levels at which cuneiform signs can be described . Graphemes may appear in several different , yet equally valid , forms ; these are labelled allographs . Each instance - the actual mark or set of marks one sees in the clay - is an example of an allograph of a grapheme ; these are labelled graphs . To illustrate the difference between graph , allograph and grapheme , consider alphabetic writing . Readers of alphabetic writing , as they look at what they are reading , see a long string of graphs . Effortlessly they identify each graph as a valid instance of a particular letter or mark of punctuation , that is , as a depiction of a grapheme . Even in the highly controlled graphic environment of print there is still a lot of allographic variation : the grapheme / a / , for instance , may be a roman ' a ' or an italic ' a ' , ( in most typefaces a completely different form ) . All of these are recognised without hesitation by skilled readers as being different versions of the same thing , allographs of the grapheme / a / , and therefore , in our alphabetic script , inviting the same range of phonological realisation . We see those different graphic shapes , and in our head appears the noise ' a ' or ' ay ' or whatever else the context dictates . For a more detailed discussion , see the terminology section . In the study of cuneiform , work has been concentrated at the graphemic level . Great efforts have been made to identify the cuneiform signs , and there are standard lists that name and illustrate them . But little work has been done at the allographic level , which is the level of a truly useful sign list , nor at the graphic level , the level at which the identifying characteristics of individual scribes are to be found . The reasons for this are partly </doc>

274,A1,"' The sooner we dispatch the snobbery that "" West is best , "" the better . ' You must have had your head buried in a mountain of Big Macs this year not to know that obesity is killing us . Accusations are piling up alongside our collective fat mountain . Politicians , schools , hospitals and food manufacturers are to blame . And those of us not of broom handle stature are lazy , uneducated or just plain greedy . Such irresponsibility is threatening the very heart of our nation . The war on fat is upon us , as are weapons of mass hysteria . Diet this , fit club that . But is anybody actually tackling the real issues ? Why do we have such a problem with food ? What is a healthy body image ? How come we are overeating when millions die from food shortages ? Well the good news is , there are actually a fair number of books to help us savour all issues regarding food . Here are five to give you some fibre to chew on . Fat is a Feminist Issue Susie Orbach , Arrow £ 7.99 Rightly , Orbach's classic has been selling for over 25 years . It blows from the table the myth that if only we remembered the millions starving in Africa we would n ' t over indulge . Rather , she suggests that parents chastising children for leftovers on their plate and reminding them of starving children , are the problem . Accordingly our society has become obsessed with engulfing all in our way and incapable of telling when our bodies are full . Not convinced ? Try her exercise of leaving a mouthful of food on your plate and throwing it away - not for the faint stomached ! Add to that , psychological pressures leading to "" comfort eating "" and it 's no wonder we are in a mess . The expectations on women especially , to smile passively , lead us to swallowing our anger and depression . Again there are numerous exercises to help us take control of our bodies and minds . A far more useful book than those proscribing foods , which often lead to cravings followed by guilty bingeing . What Would Jesus Eat ? Dr Don Colbert , STL £ 16.99 WWJD bracelets are out . What you really need is a WWJE fridge magnet . Well you do if you go along with Dr Don Colbert anyway . If you want a decent book on the whys and wherefores of healthy food then this is as good as any . There is nothing too groundbreaking however with the mantra of wholegrains - good , French Fries - bad , forming the general advice . The Christian physician also takes a welcome look at the need for free range cattle and kosher meats rather than intensive farming . But , and with such a title there has to be a but , to justify good eating Colbert relies on the often spurious use of bible verses . For example , Jesus referring to God being like a mother hen , points to the fact that he ate chicken - apparently . What is in essence a useful book , becomes a sad reflection of the fact that some Christians will only follow common sense if preceded by "" Jesus said ... "" PS . If you are really keen there is an accompanying cookbook . Fat Land Greg Critser , Penguin £ 6.99 Critser like so many of us , was overweight . It was only when he nearly caused an accident and was called "" fatso "" he decided to do something about it . This decision led to a journey into the world of fat reduction and a discovery of some of the real causes behind America's obesity problem . Critser was quick to realise that obesity is intricately linked to class and wealth . The book is full of frightening figures showing how poor communities are more likely to suffer obesity related health problems than the rich . The availability of decent education that is not sponsored by Pizza Hut , MacDonalds or other such health aficionados is limited . As is good proactive , preventative healthcare . These are not exactly revolutionary claims but Crister's exploration of how "" bad foods "" such as sugar and fats are subsidised more than healthy foods is illuminating . Do n't be put off by the American slant as much of the book has relevance in the UK too ; not least because we are fast following in their footsteps , both culturally and in body shape . We are provided with a well researched , readable book that exposes some of the real causes of Western obesity . It is not just individual greed and lack lustre will power that is to blame . So We Shall Reap Colin Tudge , Penguin £ 8.99 Highly critical of the short termism and lack of diversity in our food production , Tudge argues that instead of starvation being a reality for the majority world , all people should be able to eat for time immemorial . That is , if we change our attitudes . Tudge , a zoologist and a Research Fellow at the Centre of Philosophy at LSE does not eschew science . He is not an organic fetishist with simplistic answers , but he does rigorously examine the need for more regional farming and learning from traditional methods . The sooner we dispatch the snobbery that "" West is best , "" the better . Alongside his historical account of humanity's ability to farm , he writes that we are spiritual beings and therefore have a need to look after the land and wildlife around us . Our status as intelligent beings also brings with it the compunction to design sustainable farming methods that will provide food for tens of thousands of years . Sadly he does not examine fully these claims . I passionately believe he is right , but on a daily basis , humanity refuses to live its responsibility . Let's just hope that some people may start to act on this important book . The Apologist Jay Rayner , Atlantic Books £ 10 After discovering one of his columns has led to the suicide of a restaurateur , food critic Marc , decides to apologise . This leads to an all-consuming desire to apologise to everybody he has sinned against - ever . The UN are quick to pick up on his passion and make him Chief Apologist and task him with leading countries to apologise to each other for historical hurts . A new life starts for this man who has struggled with the meaning of a healthy body image since childhood . As weight is lost , Marc discovers that gluttony and greed affect far more than a person's feeding cycle . Is love of good food a crime ? Do we assume that only rich people have sophisticated taste buds ? How do we learn to love one another and ourselves ? All these questions and more are tackled with dark humour interspersed with descriptions of food , which are almost erotic in detail . Forget diets , forget health gurus , Jay Rayner has the answer to our obesity ; we are broken human beings . We might sort out one problem but are just too good at simply causing another . A superb morality tale for all those who think greed is simple issue . </doc>

1610,A16,"• Higher incidence of aches and pains • Hearing loss , especially limited to the one ear most exposed to the snoring • High levels of fatigue and daytime sleepiness • Fibromyalgia • Depression or poorer mental health • Memory impairment One Mayo Clinic study found that the bed partners of people who snore woke at least partially an average of 21 times per hour . This is nearly as often as the 27 times per hour that the "" snorers "" were awakened by their own documented sleep disorders ( such as sleep apnea ) . Both bed partners may be suffering from a sleep-disordered breathing and sleep deprivation although only one may have the real problem . Often those who snore do not take complaints from their bed partner seriously or act in denial , which further exacerbates the problem . A Unique Approach Snoring and sleep apnea are conditions inflicted during sleep . During the night , the normal tongue and jaw positions allow air to pass through the throat effortlessly . The tongue is forward , the jaw is closed and the airway is open . When a person suffers from sleep apnea , his / her airway is blocked periodically through the night depending on the severity of the sleep apnea . The mouth is open , the tongue and soft tissue relaxes and collapses into the throat . This causes the person to snore and possibly have sleep apnea episodes . </doc>

1376,A17,"Smooth , sleek and sophisticated , the ASKO D5223XXLCS may surprise a prospective buyer by the fact that it only sells for a little more or less than a thousand dollars . With no comparison with other ASKO XXL series dishwashers , this particular model can already offer the most basic features , options and much more . The consumer can expect safety , affordability , customization and style all rolled into one machine . Interior Features The has 7 temperature settings and 6 wash / dry options to choose from . Though the dishwasher model can not produce the 8 temperature and 12 wash / dry options that other models have , what it has is enough to provide just the right conditions for the dishes to be washed and dried thoroughly . With PowerZone washing options , the dishwasher can deliver just the right amount of water pressure on the dishes . There is a ASKO D5223XXLCS PowerZone option for pots and pans and another one for cutlery . The dishwasher operates with a 7 spray wash system . It has a Self-Cleaning Triple Filtration System ( SCS ) for easy cleanup . Armed with safety features , the ASKO D5223XXLCS should be safe to operate around small children . Of course , supervision is still highly advised . In the case that children do get near the appliance without the presence of the adults , the KidSafe feature should act as a backup . The dishwasher model comes with a 2 plus 1 year warranty on labors and parts . This is a backup on the otherwise very durable and rust-free materials used to build the dishwasher . Exterior Features The frame , the filter , the spray arms and the tank are all made of stainless steel . Stainless steel is well-chosen for its rust-free characteristic . The FlexiRacks feature help in accommodating different types of wares into the dishwasher . The racks can be reorganized and adjusted to suit the current load . The door handle is curved instead of the more usual towel bar door handle style . This offers more convenience to the user . The ASKO D5223XXLCS dishwasher operates at a mere 50 dB ( A ) . So , it will not disturb the household when it is on . The racks can be adjusted to suit oddly-shaped , tall or wide objects . The dishwasher is safe to use , whether the consumer has a child in tow or not . It is also an easy to use and install product – a dream-come-true for people who hate to read or reread manuals . The product is built to last but the manufacturer still backs it up with a pretty good warranty . Disadvantages There is no door handle style option . The consumer has to be content with just one style – the curved door handle one . The additional features found in other ASKO XXL dishwashers could be a little more reassuring . </doc>

811,A16,"The wind has great power as we have all experienced on particularly windy days . It can be very destructive , ripping off roofs and toppling trees , as during hurricanes and storms . But this power can be harnessed more benevolently to generate electricity . Wind turbines use the power in the wind to drive large aerodynamic blades , similar to helicopter blades , these blades turn a generator , which generates electricity . The amount of electricity generated is related to the strength of the wind , so the stronger the wind the more electricity is generated . Wind is a clean form of electricity generation , it requires no fuel at all . So once a wind generator is operational it has very low running costs . There are draw backs , the wind does not blow all of the time , so sometimes it is not possible to generate . This intermittency of electricity supply means that there has to be a backup electricity generation capacity in the system . Wind can be used at small as well as large scale and can be sited almost anywhere , depending upon the size of the installation . Larger turbines do require open space with uninterrupted wind , but small turbines can be roof mounted or placed near a building . Large scale wind can generate at close to current market price for electricity and is cheaper than some conventional fuels . </doc>

493,A8,"Thursday , 8 August , 2002 , 15 : 53 GMT 16 : 53 UK Turkmen leader to rename calendar Niyazov spends lavishly on spectacular palaces Turkmenistan President Saparmurat Niyazov has announced his intention to officially rename all 12 months of the year in commemoration of the country's heroes and most potent national symbols . It seems like he lives on another planet Turkmen man Mr Niyazov proposes to rename January Turkmenbashi after his official name , which means Head of all the Turkmen . Other months will be renamed to honour famous Turkmen poets and writers . He also wants the seven days of the week to be renamed , with uplifting phrases such as Young Day for Tuesday and Spirituality Day for Saturday . Mr Niyazov , who was attending Turkmenistan's annual People's Council , also said he wants to call the month of April "" Mother "" . In response , a speaker at the council suggested calling the month by the full name of the president's deceased mother , Gurbansoltan , which the president said he would consider . Public opinion Mr Niyazov already has several schools , cities , airports and even a meteorite named after him . Niyazov has ruled Turkmenistan unchallenged since 1985 Many people on the streets of Turkmenistan seemed unperturbed , but others were bitter regarding their leader's latest plans . "" This is a joke , the entire civilized world lives by the same calendar but Niyazov decides to set us apart once again , "" one man told the AFP news agency . "" It seems like he lives on another planet . "" Cult of personality The People's Council also called on Thursday for the eccentric leader to remain in power until his death , rejecting Mr Niyazov's proposal to step down and hold elections in 2010 , Reuters news agency reported . He was made president for life in 1999 . Mr Niyazov has ruled the country since he was appointed Communist Party chief in 1985 when it was still part of the Soviet Union . He quickly developed a cult of personality surrounding himself , suppressing legitimate political opposition . He has spent vast sums of money on lavish palaces and statues of himself , despite the country's increasing poverty . Much of the cash for such grandiose projects is thought to stem from deals involving Turkmenistan's rich oil and gas reserves . </doc>

E. 2242 / 98-99 Chapter 1 : Hospital , Community Health and Ambulance Trusts Case No. E. 2242 / 98-99 - Inadequate arrangements for care following discharge ; inadequate response to request for independent review Complaint against : Lincoln and Louth NHS Trust Summary of case Mrs P was treated by the Trust for a broken hip following a fall at home in April 1997 . Her son , Mr L , complained that , despite the family's concerns that she was becoming increasingly confused , Mrs P was discharged without a psychiatric assessment . The Ombudsman's professional assessors concluded that Mrs P's pre-discharge assessment was adequate ; her discharge was appropriately planned ; and the necessary support for her discharge home was put in place . The Ombudsman did not uphold this aspect of the complaint . Mr L also complained about the Trust's handling of two requests he made for independent review ( IR ) . The Ombudsman concluded that the Trust did not deal adequately with either request . They failed to refer the first to the convener , as required by national guidance , and instead attempted further local resolution . When this was unsuccessful and Mr L made a second request for IR , the Trust failed to respond because of staffing difficulties and procedural weaknesses . This aspect of the complaint was upheld . The Trust apologised to Mr L and confirmed that they had taken steps to improve complaint handling procedures . </doc>

Rule 72 In camera procedure to consider relevance or admissibility of evidence Where there is an intention to introduce or elicit , including by means of the questioning of a victim or witness , evidence that the victim consented to an alleged crime of sexual violence , or evidence of the words , conduct , silence or lack of resistance of a victim or witness as referred to in principles ( a ) through ( d ) of rule 70 , notification shall be provided to the Court which shall describe the substance of the evidence intended to be introduced or elicited and the relevance of the evidence to the issues in the case . In deciding whether the evidence referred to in sub-rule 1 is relevant or admissible , a Chamber shall hear in camera the views of the Prosecutor , the defence , the witness and the victim or his or her legal representative , if any , and shall take into account whether that evidence has a sufficient degree of probative value to an issue in the case and the prejudice that such evidence may cause , in accordance with article 69 , paragraph 4 . For this purpose , the Chamber shall have regard to article 21 , paragraph 3 , and articles 67 and 68 , and shall be guided by principles ( a ) to ( d ) of rule 70 , especially with respect to the proposed questioning of a victim . Where the Chamber determines that the evidence referred to in sub-rule 2 is admissible in the proceedings , the Chamber shall state on the record the specific purpose for which the evidence is admissible . In evaluating the evidence during the proceedings , the Chamber shall apply principles ( a ) to ( d ) of rule 70 . Rule 73 Privileged communications and information Without prejudice to article 67 , paragraph 1 ( b ) , communications made in the context of the professional relationship between a person and his or her legal counsel shall be regarded as privileged , and consequently not subject to disclosure , unless : ( a ) The person consents in writing to such disclosure ; or ( b ) The person voluntarily disclosed the content of the communication to a third party , and that third party then gives evidence of that disclosure . Having regard to rule 63 , sub-rule 5 , communications made in the context of a class of professional or other confidential relationships shall be regarded as privileged , and consequently not subject to disclosure , under the same terms as in sub-rules 1 ( a ) and 1 ( b ) if a Chamber decides in respect of that class that : ( a ) Communications occurring within that class of relationship are made in the course of a confidential relationship producing a reasonable expectation of privacy and non-disclosure ; ( b ) Confidentiality is essential to the nature and type of relationship between the person and the confidant ; and ( c ) Recognition of the privilege would further the objectives of the Statute and the Rules . In making a decision under sub-rule 2 , the Court shall give particular regard to recognizing as privileged those communications made in the context of the professional relationship between a person and his or her medical doctor , psychiatrist , psychologist or counsellor , in particular those related to or involving victims , or between a person and a member of a religious clergy ; and in the latter case , the Court shall recognize as privileged those communications made in the context of a sacred confession where it is an integral part of the practice of that religion . The Court shall regard as privileged , and consequently not subject to disclosure , including by way of testimony of any present or past official or employee of the International Committee of the Red Cross ( ICRC ) , any information , documents or other evidence which it came into the possession of in the course , or as a consequence , of the performance by ICRC of its functions under the Statutes of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement , unless : ( a ) After consultations undertaken pursuant to sub-rule 6 , ICRC does not object in writing to such disclosure , or otherwise has waived this privilege ; or ( b ) Such information , documents or other evidence is contained in public statements and documents of ICRC . Nothing in sub-rule 4 shall affect the admissibility of the same evidence obtained from a source other than ICRC and its officials or employees when such evidence has also been acquired by this source independently of ICRC and its officials or employees . If the Court determines that ICRC information , documents or other evidence are of great importance for a particular case , consultations shall be held between the Court and ICRC in order to seek to resolve the matter by cooperative means , bearing in mind the circumstances of the case , the relevance of the evidence sought , whether the evidence could be obtained from a source other than ICRC , the interests of justice and of victims , and the performance of the Court's and ICRC's functions . Rule 74 Self-incrimination by a witness Unless a witness has been notified pursuant to rule 190 , the Chamber shall notify a witness of the provisions of this rule before his or her testimony . Where the Court determines that an assurance with respect to self-incrimination should be provided to a particular witness , it shall provide the assurances under sub-rule 3 , paragraph ( c ) , before the witness attends , directly or pursuant to a request under article 93 , paragraph ( 1 ) ( e ) . ( a ) A witness may object to making any statement that might tend to incriminate him or her . ( b ) Where the witness has attended after receiving an assurance under sub-rule 2 , the Court may require the witness to answer the question or questions . ( c ) In the case of other witnesses , the Chamber may require the witness to answer the question or questions , after assuring the witness that the evidence provided in response to the questions : ( i ) Will be kept confidential and will not be disclosed to the public or any State ; and ( ii ) Will not be used either directly or indirectly against that person in any subsequent prosecution by the Court , except under articles 70 and 71 . Before giving such an assurance , the Chamber shall seek the views of the Prosecutor , ex parte , to determine if the assurance should be given to this particular witness . In determining whether to require the witness to answer , the Chamber shall consider : ( a ) The importance of the anticipated evidence ; ( b ) Whether the witness would be providing unique evidence ; ( c ) The nature of the possible incrimination , if known ; and ( d ) The sufficiency of the protections for the witness , in the particular circumstances . If the Chamber determines that it would not be appropriate to provide an assurance to this witness , it shall not require the witness to answer the question . If the Chamber determines not to require the witness to answer , it may still continue the questioning of the witness on other matters . In order to give effect to the assurance , the Chamber shall : ( a ) Order that the evidence of the witness be given in camera ; ( b ) Order that the identity of the witness and the content of the evidence given shall not be disclosed , in any manner , and provide that the breach of any such order will be subject to sanction under article 71 ; ( c ) Specifically advise the Prosecutor , the accused , the defence counsel , the legal representative of the victim and any Court staff present of the consequences of a breach of the order under subparagraph ( b ) ; ( d ) Order the sealing of any record of the proceedings ; and ( e ) Use protective measures with respect to any decision of the Court to ensure that the identity of the witness and the content of the evidence given are not disclosed . Where the Prosecutor is aware that the testimony of any witness may raise issues with respect to self-incrimination , he or she shall request an in camera hearing and advise the Chamber of this , in advance of the testimony of the witness . The Chamber may impose the measures outlined in sub-rule 7 for all or a part of the testimony of that witness . The accused , the defence counsel or the witness may advise the Prosecutor or the Chamber that the testimony of a witness will raise issues of self-incrimination before the witness testifies and the Chamber may take the measures outlined in sub-rule 7 . If an issue of self-incrimination arises in the course of the proceedings , the Chamber shall suspend the taking of the testimony and provide the witness with an opportunity to obtain legal advice if he or she so requests for the purpose of the application of the rule . Rule 75 Incrimination by family members A witness appearing before the Court , who is a spouse , child or parent of an accused person , shall not be required by a Chamber to make any statement that might tend to incriminate that accused person . However , the witness may choose to make such a statement . In evaluating the testimony of a witness , a Chamber may take into account that the witness , referred to in sub-rule 1 , objected to reply to a question which was intended to contradict a previous statement made by the witness , or the witness was selective in choosing which questions to answer . Section II Disclosure Rule 76 Pre-trial disclosure relating to prosecution witnesses The Prosecutor shall provide the defence with the names of witnesses whom the Prosecutor intends to call to testify and copies of any prior statements made by those witnesses . This shall be done sufficiently in advance to enable the adequate preparation of the defence . The Prosecutor shall subsequently advise the defence of the names of any additional prosecution witnesses and provide copies of their statements when the decision is made to call those witnesses . The statements of prosecution witnesses shall be made available in original and in a language which the accused fully understands and speaks . This rule is subject to the protection and privacy of victims and witnesses and the protection of confidential information as provided for in the Statute and rules 81 and 82 . Rule 77 Inspection of material in possession or control of the Prosecutor The Prosecutor shall , subject to the restrictions on disclosure as provided for in the Statute and in rules 81 and 82 , permit the defence to inspect any books , documents , photographs and other tangible objects in the possession or control of the Prosecutor , which are material to the preparation of the defence or are intended for use by the Prosecutor as evidence for the purposes of the confirmation hearing or at trial , as the case may be , or were obtained from or belonged to the person . Rule 78 Inspection of material in possession or control of the defence The defence shall permit the Prosecutor to inspect any books , documents , photographs and other tangible objects in the possession or control of the defence , which are intended for use by the defence as evidence for the purposes of the confirmation hearing or at trial . Rule 79 Disclosure by the defence The defence shall notify the Prosecutor of its intent to : ( a ) Raise the existence of an alibi , in which case the notification shall specify the place or places at which the accused claims to have been present at the time of the alleged crime and the names of witnesses and any other evidence upon which the accused intends to rely to establish the alibi ; or ( b ) Raise a ground for excluding criminal responsibility provided for in article 31 , paragraph 1 , in which case the notification shall specify the names of witnesses and any other evidence upon which the accused intends to rely to establish the ground . With due regard to time limits set forth in other rules , notification under sub-rule 1 shall be given sufficiently in advance to enable the Prosecutor to prepare adequately and to respond . The Chamber dealing with the matter may grant the Prosecutor an adjournment to address the issue raised by the defence . Failure of the defence to provide notice under this rule shall not limit its right to raise matters dealt with in sub-rule 1 and to present evidence . This rule does not prevent a Chamber from ordering disclosure of any other evidence . Rule 80 Procedures for raising a ground for excluding criminal responsibility under article 31 , paragraph 3 The defence shall give notice to both the Trial Chamber and the Prosecutor if it intends to raise a ground for excluding criminal responsibility under article 31 , paragraph 3 . This shall be done sufficiently in advance of the commencement of the trial to enable the Prosecutor to prepare adequately for trial . Following notice given under sub-rule 1 , the Trial Chamber shall hear both the Prosecutor and the defence before deciding whether the defence can raise a ground for excluding criminal responsibility . If the defence is permitted to raise the ground , the Trial Chamber may grant the Prosecutor an adjournment to address that ground . Rule 81 Restrictions on disclosure Reports , memoranda or other internal documents prepared by a party , its assistants or representatives in connection with the investigation or preparation of the case are not subject to disclosure . Where material or information is in the possession or control of the Prosecutor which must be disclosed in accordance with the Statute , but disclosure may prejudice further or ongoing investigations , the Prosecutor may apply to the Chamber dealing with the matter for a ruling as to whether the material or information must be disclosed to the defence . The matter shall be heard on an ex parte basis by the Chamber . However , the Prosecutor may not introduce such material or information into evidence during the confirmation hearing or the trial without adequate prior disclosure to the accused . Where steps have been taken to ensure the confidentiality of information , in accordance with articles 54 , 57 , 64 , 72 and 93 , and , in accordance with article 68 , to protect the safety of witnesses and victims and members of their families , such information shall not be disclosed , except in accordance with those articles . When the disclosure of such information may create a risk to the safety of the witness , the Court shall take measures to inform the witness in advance . The Chamber dealing with the matter shall , on its own motion or at the request of the Prosecutor , the accused or any State , take the necessary steps to ensure the confidentiality of information , in accordance with articles 54 , 72 and 93 , and , in accordance with article 68 , to protect the safety of witnesses and victims and members of their families , including by authorizing the non-disclosure of their identity prior to the commencement of the trial . Where material or information is in the possession or control of the Prosecutor which is withheld under article 68 , paragraph 5 , such material and information may not be subsequently introduced into evidence during the confirmation hearing or the trial without adequate prior disclosure to the accused . Where material or information is in the possession or control of the defence which is subject to disclosure , it may be withheld in circumstances similar to those which would allow the Prosecutor to rely on article 68 , paragraph 5 , and a summary thereof submitted instead . Such material and information may not be subsequently introduced into evidence during the confirmation hearing or the trial without adequate prior disclosure to the Prosecutor . Rule 82 Restrictions on disclosure of material and information protected under article 54 , paragraph 3 ( e ) Where material or information is in the possession or control of the Prosecutor which is protected under article 54 , paragraph 3 ( e ) , the Prosecutor may not subsequently introduce such material or information into evidence without the prior consent of the provider of the material or information and adequate prior disclosure to the accused . If the Prosecutor introduces material or information protected under article 54 , paragraph 3 ( e ) , into evidence , a Chamber may not order the production of additional evidence received from the provider of the initial material or information , nor may a Chamber for the purpose of obtaining such additional evidence itself summon the provider or a representative of the provider as a witness or order their attendance . If the Prosecutor calls a witness to introduce in evidence any material or information which has been protected under article 54 , paragraph 3 ( e ) , a Chamber may not compel that witness to answer any question relating to the material or information or its origin , if the witness declines to answer on grounds of confidentiality . The right of the accused to challenge evidence which has been protected under article 54 , paragraph 3 ( e ) , shall remain unaffected subject only to the limitations contained in sub-rules 2 and 3 . A Chamber dealing with the matter may order , upon application by the defence , that , in the interests of justice , material or information in the possession of the accused , which has been provided to the accused under the same conditions as set forth in article 54 , paragraph 3 ( e ) , and which is to be introduced into evidence , shall be subject mutatis mutandis to sub-rules 1 , 2 and 3 . Rule 83 Ruling on exculpatory evidence under article 67 , paragraph 2 The Prosecutor may request as soon as practicable a hearing on an ex parte basis before the Chamber dealing with the matter for the purpose of obtaining a ruling under article 67 , paragraph 2 .

Responses to motions or requests filed under seal shall also be filed under seal . A Chamber may , on a motion or request under sub-rule 1 , hold a hearing , which shall be conducted in camera , to determine whether to order measures to prevent the release to the public or press and information agencies , of the identity or the location of a victim , a witness or other person at risk on account of testimony given by a witness by ordering , inter alia : ( a ) That the name of the victim , witness or other person at risk on account of testimony given by a witness or any information which could lead to his or her identification , be expunged from the public records of the Chamber ; ( b ) That the Prosecutor , the defence or any other participant in the proceedings be prohibited from disclosing such information to a third party ; ( c ) That testimony be presented by electronic or other special means , including the use of technical means enabling the alteration of pictures or voice , the use of audio-visual technology , in particular videoconferencing and closed-circuit television , and the exclusive use of the sound media ; ( d ) That a pseudonym be used for a victim , a witness or other person at risk on account of testimony given by a witness ; or ( e ) That a Chamber conduct part of its proceedings in camera . Rule 88 Special measures Upon the motion of the Prosecutor or the defence , or upon the request of a witness or a victim or his or her legal representative , if any , or on its own motion , and after having consulted with the Victims and Witnesses Unit , as appropriate , a Chamber may , taking into account the views of the victim or witness , order special measures such as , but not limited to , measures to facilitate the testimony of a traumatized victim or witness , a child , an elderly person or a victim of sexual violence , pursuant to article 68 , paragraphs 1 and 2 . The Chamber shall seek to obtain , whenever possible , the consent of the person in respect of whom the special measure is sought prior to ordering that measure . A Chamber may hold a hearing on a motion or a request under sub-rule 1 , if necessary in camera or ex parte , to determine whether to order any such special measure , including but not limited to an order that a counsel , a legal representative , a psychologist or a family member be permitted to attend during the testimony of the victim or the witness . For inter partes motions or requests filed under this rule , the provisions of rule 87 , sub-rules 2 ( b ) to ( d ) , shall apply mutatis mutandis . A motion or request filed under this rule may be filed under seal , and if so filed shall remain sealed until otherwise ordered by a Chamber . Any responses to inter partes motions or requests filed under seal shall also be filed under seal . Taking into consideration that violations of the privacy of a witness or victim may create risk to his or her security , a Chamber shall be vigilant in controlling the manner of questioning a witness or victim so as to avoid any harassment or intimidation , paying particular attention to attacks on victims of crimes of sexual violence . Subsection 3 Participation of victims in the proceedings Rule 89 Application for participation of victims in the proceedings In order to present their views and concerns , victims shall make written application to the Registrar , who shall transmit the application to the relevant Chamber . Subject to the provisions of the Statute , in particular article 68 , paragraph 1 , the Registrar shall provide a copy of the application to the Prosecutor and the defence , who shall be entitled to reply within a time limit to be set by the Chamber . Subject to the provisions of sub-rule 2 , the Chamber shall then specify the proceedings and manner in which participation is considered appropriate , which may include making opening and closing statements . The Chamber , on its own initiative or on the application of the Prosecutor or the defence , may reject the application if it considers that the person is not a victim or that the criteria set forth in article 68 , paragraph 3 , are not otherwise fulfilled . A victim whose application has been rejected may file a new application later in the proceedings . An application referred to in this rule may also be made by a person acting with the consent of the victim , or a person acting on behalf of a victim , in the case of a victim who is a child or , when necessary , a victim who is disabled . Where there are a number of applications , the Chamber may consider the applications in such a manner as to ensure the effectiveness of the proceedings and may issue one decision . Rule 90 Legal representatives of victims A victim shall be free to choose a legal representative . Where there are a number of victims , the Chamber may , for the purposes of ensuring the effectiveness of the proceedings , request the victims or particular groups of victims , if necessary with the assistance of the Registry , to choose a common legal representative or representatives . In facilitating the coordination of victim representation , the Registry may provide assistance , inter alia , by referring the victims to a list of counsel , maintained by the Registry , or suggesting one or more common legal representatives . If the victims are unable to choose a common legal representative or representatives within a time limit that the Chamber may decide , the Chamber may request the Registrar to choose one or more common legal representatives . The Chamber and the Registry shall take all reasonable steps to ensure that in the selection of common legal representatives , the distinct interests of the victims , particularly as provided in article 68 , paragraph 1 , are represented and that any conflict of interest is avoided . A victim or group of victims who lack the necessary means to pay for a common legal representative chosen by the Court may receive assistance from the Registry , including , as appropriate , financial assistance . A legal representative of a victim or victims shall have the qualifications set forth in rule 22 , sub-rule 1 . Rule 91 Participation of legal representatives in the proceedings A Chamber may modify a previous ruling under rule 89 . A legal representative of a victim shall be entitled to attend and participate in the proceedings in accordance with the terms of the ruling of the Chamber and any modification thereof given under rules 89 and 90 . This shall include participation in hearings unless , in the circumstances of the case , the Chamber concerned is of the view that the representative's intervention should be confined to written observations or submissions . The Prosecutor and the defence shall be allowed to reply to any oral or written observation by the legal representative for victims . ( a ) When a legal representative attends and participates in accordance with this rule , and wishes to question a witness , including questioning under rules 67 and 68 , an expert or the accused , the legal representative must make application to the Chamber . The Chamber may require the legal representative to provide a written note of the questions and in that case the questions shall be communicated to the Prosecutor and , if appropriate , the defence , who shall be allowed to make observations within a time limit set by the Chamber . ( b ) The Chamber shall then issue a ruling on the request , taking into account the stage of the proceedings , the rights of the accused , the interests of witnesses , the need for a fair , impartial and expeditious trial and in order to give effect to article 68 , paragraph 3 . The ruling may include directions on the manner and order of the questions and the production of documents in accordance with the powers of the Chamber under article 64 . The Chamber may , if it considers it appropriate , put the question to the witness , expert or accused on behalf of the victim's legal representative . For a hearing limited to reparations under article 75 , the restrictions on questioning by the legal representative set forth in sub-rule 2 shall not apply . In that case , the legal representative may , with the permission of the Chamber concerned , question witnesses , experts and the person concerned . Rule 92 Notification to victims and their legal representatives This rule on notification to victims and their legal representatives shall apply to all proceedings before the Court , except in proceedings provided for in Part 2 . In order to allow victims to apply for participation in the proceedings in accordance with rule 89 , the Court shall notify victims concerning the decision of the Prosecutor not to initiate an investigation or not to prosecute pursuant to article 53 . Such a notification shall be given to victims or their legal representatives who have already participated in the proceedings or , as far as possible , to those who have communicated with the Court in respect of the situation or case in question .

When a notification for participation as provided for in sub-rules 2 and 3 has been given , any subsequent notification as referred to in sub-rules 5 and 6 shall only be provided to victims or their legal representatives who may participate in the proceedings in accordance with a ruling of the Chamber pursuant to rule 89 and any modification thereof . In a manner consistent with the ruling made under rules 89 to 91 , victims or their legal representatives participating in proceedings shall , in respect of those proceedings , be notified by the Registrar in a timely manner of : ( a ) Proceedings before the Court , including the date of hearings and any postponements thereof , and the date of delivery of the decision ; ( b ) Requests , submissions , motions and other documents relating to such requests , submissions or motions . Where victims or their legal representatives have participated in a certain stage of the proceedings , the Registrar shall notify them as soon as possible of the decisions of the Court in those proceedings .

The Registry shall keep a record of all notifications . Where necessary , the Registrar may seek the cooperation of States Parties in accordance with article 93 , paragraph 1 ( d ) and ( l ) . For notification as referred to in sub-rule 3 and otherwise at the request of a Chamber , the Registrar shall take necessary measures to give adequate publicity to the proceedings . In doing so , the Registrar may seek , in accordance with Part 9 , the cooperation of relevant States Parties , and seek the assistance of intergovernmental organizations . Rule 93 Views of victims or their legal representatives A Chamber may seek the views of victims or their legal representatives participating pursuant to rules 89 to 91 on any issue , inter alia , in relation to issues referred to in rules 107 , 109 , 125 , 128 , 136 , 139 and 191 .

At commencement of the trial and subject to any protective measures , the Court shall ask the Registrar to provide notification of the request to the person or persons named in the request or identified in the charges and , to the extent possible , to any interested persons or any interested States . Those notified shall file with the Registry any representation made under article 75 , paragraph 3 . Rule 95 Procedure on the motion of the Court In cases where the Court intends to proceed on its own motion pursuant to article 75 , paragraph 1 , it shall ask the Registrar to provide notification of its intention to the person or persons against whom the Court is considering making a determination , and , to the extent possible , to victims , interested persons and interested States . Those notified shall file with the Registry any representation made under article 75 , paragraph 3 . If , as a result of notification under sub-rule 1 : ( a ) A victim makes a request for reparations , that request will be determined as if it had been brought under rule 94 ; ( b ) A victim requests that the Court does not make an order for reparations , the Court shall not proceed to make an individual order in respect of that victim . Rule 96 Publication of reparation proceedings Without prejudice to any other rules on notification of proceedings , the Registrar shall , insofar as practicable , notify the victims or their legal representatives and the person or persons concerned . The Registrar shall also , having regard to any information provided by the Prosecutor , take all the necessary measures to give adequate publicity of the reparation proceedings before the Court , to the extent possible , to other victims , interested persons and interested States . In taking the measures described in sub-rule 1 , the Court may seek , in accordance with Part 9 , the cooperation of relevant States Parties , and seek the assistance of intergovernmental organizations in order to give publicity , as widely as possible and by all possible means , to the reparation proceedings before the Court . Rule 97 Assessment of reparations Taking into account the scope and extent of any damage , loss or injury , the Court may award reparations on an individualized basis or , where it deems it appropriate , on a collective basis or both . At the request of victims or their legal representatives , or at the request of the convicted person , or on its own motion , the Court may appoint appropriate experts to assist it in determining the scope , extent of any damage , loss and injury to , or in respect of victims and to suggest various options concerning the appropriate types and modalities of reparations . The Court shall invite , as appropriate , victims or their legal representatives , the convicted person as well as interested persons and interested States to make observations on the reports of the experts . In all cases , the Court shall respect the rights of victims and the convicted person . Rule 98 Trust Fund Individual awards for reparations shall be made directly against a convicted person . The Court may order that an award for reparations against a convicted person be deposited with the Trust Fund where at the time of making the order it is impossible or impracticable to make individual awards directly to each victim . The award for reparations thus deposited in the Trust Fund shall be separated from other resources of the Trust Fund and shall be forwarded to each victim as soon as possible . The Court may order that an award for reparations against a convicted person be made through the Trust Fund where the number of the victims and the scope , forms and modalities of reparations makes a collective award more appropriate . Following consultations with interested States and the Trust Fund , the Court may order that an award for reparations be made through the Trust Fund to an intergovernmental , international or national organization approved by the Trust Fund . Other resources of the Trust Fund may be used for the benefit of victims subject to the provisions of article 79 . Rule 99 Cooperation and protective measures for the purpose of forfeiture under articles 57 , paragraph 3 ( e ) , and 75 , paragraph 4 The Pre-Trial Chamber , pursuant to article 57 , paragraph 3 ( e ) , or the Trial Chamber , pursuant to article 75 , paragraph 4 , may , on its own motion or on the application of the Prosecutor or at the request of the victims or their legal representatives who have made a request for reparations or who have given a written undertaking to do so , determine whether measures should be requested . Notice is not required unless the Court determines , in the particular circumstances of the case , that notification could not jeopardize the effectiveness of the measures requested . In the latter case , the Registrar shall provide notification of the proceedings to the person against whom a request is made and so far as is possible to any interested persons or interested States . If an order is made without prior notification , the relevant Chamber shall request the Registrar , as soon as is consistent with the effectiveness of the measures requested , to notify those against whom a request is made and , to the extent possible , to any interested persons or any interested States and invite them to make observations as to whether the order should be revoked or otherwise modified . The Court may make orders as to the timing and conduct of any proceedings necessary to determine these issues . Section IV Miscellaneous provisions Rule 100 Place of the proceedings In a particular case , where the Court considers that it would be in the interests of justice , it may decide to sit in a State other than the host State .

The Registrar shall ensure the proper conduct of the transfer , in liaison with the authorities of the State of enforcement and the authorities of the host State . When the purposes of the transfer have been fulfilled , the Court shall return the sentenced person to the State of enforcement . The person shall be kept in custody during his or her presence before the Court . The entire period of detention spent at the seat of the Court shall be deducted from the sentence remaining to be served .

Any concerned third State or sending State may provide additional information to assist the Court . The Court may not proceed with a request for the surrender of a person without the consent of a sending State if , under article 98 , paragraph 2 , such a request would be inconsistent with obligations under an international agreement pursuant to which the consent of a sending State is required prior to the surrender of a person of that State to the Court .

148,A1,"So I am a pediatric cancer doctor and stem-cell researcher at Stanford University where my clinical focus has been bone marrow transplantation . Now , inspired by Jill Bolte Taylor last year , I did n't bring a human brain , but I did bring a liter of bone marrow . And bone marrow is actually what we use to save the lives of tens of thousands of patients , most of whom have advanced malignancies like leukemia and lymphoma and some other diseases . So , a few years ago , I 'm doing my transplant fellowship at Stanford . I 'm in the operating room . We have Bob here , who is a volunteer donor . We 're sending his marrow across the country to save the life of a child with leukemia . So actually how do we harvest this bone marrow ? Well we have a whole O. R. team , general anesthesia , nurses , and another doctor across from me . Bob's on the table , and we take this sort of small needle , you know , not too big . And the way we do this is we basically place this through the soft tissue , and kind of punch it into the hard bone , into the tuchus -- that 's a technical term -- and aspirate about 10 mls of bone marrow out , each time , with a syringe . And hand it off to the nurse . She squirts it into a tin . Hands it back to me . And we do that again and again . About 200 times usually . And by the end of this my arm is sore , I 've got a callus on my hand . Let alone Bob , Whose rear end looks something more like this , like swiss cheese . So I 'm thinking , you know , this procedure has n ' t changed in about 40 years . And there is probably a better way to do this . So I thought of a minimally invasive approach . And a new device that we call the Marrow Miner . This is it . And the Marrow Miner , the way it works is shown here . Our standard see-through patient . Instead of entering the bone dozens of times , we enter just once , into the front of the hip or the back of the hip . And we have a flexible , powered catheter with a special wire loop tip that stays inside the crunchy part of the marrow and follows the contours of the hip , as it moves around . So it enables you to very rapidly aspirate , or suck out , rich bone marrow very quickly through one hole . We can do multiple passes through that same entry . No robots required . And , so , very quickly , Bob can just get one puncture , local anesthesia , and do this harvest as an outpatient . So I did a few prototypes . I got a small little grant at Stanford . And played around with this a little bit . And our team members developed this technology . And eventually we got two large animals , and pig studies . And we found , to our surprise , that we not only got bone marrow out , but we got 10 times the stem cell activity in the marrow from the Marrow Miner , compared to the normal device . This device was just FDA approved in the last year . Here is a live patient . You can see it following the flexible curves around . There will be be two passes here , in the same patient , from the same hole . This was done under local anesthesia , as an outpatient . And we got , again , about three to six times more stem cells than the standard approach done on the same patient . So why should you care ? Bone marrow is a very rich source of adult stem cells . You all know about embryonic stem cells . They 've got great potential but have n ' t yet entered clinical trials . Adult stem cells are throughout our body , including the blood-forming stem cells in our bone marrow . Which we 've been using as a form of stem-cell therapy for over 40 years . In the last decade there 's been an explosion of use of bone marrow stem cells to treat the patient's other diseases such as heart disease , vascular disease , orthopedics , tissue engineering , even in neurology to treat Parkinson's , and diabetes . We 've just come out , we 're commercializing , this year , generation 2.0 of the Marrow Miner . The hope is is that this gets more stem cells out . Which translates to better outcomes . It may encourage more people to sign up to be potential live saving bone marrow donors . It may even enable you to bank your own marrow stem cells , when you 're younger and healthier , to use in the future , should you need it . And ultimately -- and here 's a picture of our bone marrow transplant survivors , who come together for a reunion each year at Stanford . Hopefully this technology will let us have more of these survivors in the future . Thanks . ( Applause ) </content> </doc>

892,A4,""" Hoot-toot ! "" said Uncle Ebenezer , "" dinnae fly up in the snuff at me . We 'll agree fine yet . And , Davie , my man , if you 're done with that bit parritch , I could just take a sup of it myself . Ay , "" he continued , as soon as he had ousted me from the stool and spoon , "" they 're fine , halesome food -- they 're grand food , parritch . "" He murmured a little grace to himself and fell to . "" Your father was very fond of his meat , I mind ; he was a hearty , if not a great eater ; but as for me , I could never do mair than pyke at food . "" He took a pull at the small beer , which probably reminded him of hospitable duties , for his next speech ran thus : "" If ye 're dry ye 'll find water behind the door . "" To this I returned no answer , standing stiffly on my two feet , and looking down upon my uncle with a mighty angry heart . He , on his part , continued to eat like a man under some pressure of time , and to throw out little darting glances now at my shoes and now at my home-spun stockings . Once only , when he had ventured to look a little higher , our eyes met ; and no thief taken with a hand in a man's pocket could have shown more lively signals of distress . This set me in a muse , whether his timidity arose from too long a disuse of any human company ; and whether perhaps , upon a little trial , it might pass off , and my uncle change into an altogether different man . From this I was awakened by his sharp voice . "" Your father 's been long dead ? "" he asked . "" Three weeks , sir , "" said I. "" He was a secret man , Alexander -- a secret , silent man , "" he continued . "" He never said muckle when he was young . He 'll never have spoken muckle of me ? "" "" I never knew , sir , till you told it me yourself , that he had any brother . "" "" Dear me , dear me ! "" said Ebenezer . "" Nor yet of Shaws , I dare say ? "" "" Not so much as the name , sir , "" said I. "" To think o ' that ! "" said he . "" A strange nature of a man ! "" For all that , he seemed singularly satisfied , but whether with himself , or me , or with this conduct of my father's , was more than I could read . Certainly , however , he seemed to be outgrowing that distaste , or ill-will , that he had conceived at first against my person ; for presently he jumped up , came across the room behind me , and hit me a smack upon the shoulder . "" We 'll agree fine yet ! "" he cried . "" I 'm just as glad I let you in . And now come awa ' to your bed . "" To my surprise , he lit no lamp or candle , but set forth into the dark passage , groped his way , breathing deeply , up a flight of steps , and paused before a door , which he unlocked . I was close upon his heels , having stumbled after him as best I might ; and then he bade me go in , for that was my chamber . I did as he bid , but paused after a few steps , and begged a light to go to bed with . "" Hoot-toot ! "" said Uncle Ebenezer , "" there 's a fine moon . "" "" Neither moon nor star , sir , and pit-mirk , "" [ 2 ] said I. "" I cannae see the bed . "" [ 2 ] Dark as the pit . "" Hoot-toot , hoot-toot ! "" said he . "" Lights in a house is a thing I dinnae agree with . I 'm unco feared of fires . Good-night to ye , Davie , my man . "" And before I had time to add a further protest , he pulled the door to , and I heard him lock me in from the outside . I did not know whether to laugh or cry . The room was as cold as a well , and the bed , when I had found my way to it , as damp as a peat-hag ; but by good fortune I had caught up my bundle and my plaid , and rolling myself in the latter , I lay down upon the floor under lee of the big bedstead , and fell speedily asleep . </doc>

758,A14,"This paper looks at conservation policy responses to the potential loss of biodiversity benefits in Kenya from the conversion of essentially wild and undeveloped land to developed agriculture . One fundamental issue is the extent to which traditional owners and users of land have the right to benefit from the development potential of their land to further their economic and social progress , even if by so doing they create domestic and global externalities through the loss of biodiversity . Property rights are central to the debate , and we discuss here the interaction between three completely different property rights : the state over its own land , private land owners over their land , and the state over individual wild animals which migrate between state and privately owned land </doc>

190,A14,"Distr . 19 September 2003 Original : ENGLISH Opening address Ms. Heli Jeskanen-Sundström , Director General , Statistics Finland Construction of an information society is the strategic goal of many countries . The building of an information society is not a detached process , but is tied to other social policy . Social change - especially when it is rapid - presents constant new challenges to decision-makers . There is a need for knowledge about the present status quo and its background and for relevant , reliable facts about the development trends in society . Capacity for continuous renewal and ability to adapt to changing customer needs are the prerequisites for staying competitive in business . New capabilities and ways of acting are also demanded of members of society . It is no longer enough to view change from the national perspective ; the effects of globalisation extend to the public sector , business enterprises , non-governmental organisations and ordinary citizens in every country . Countries want to compare their own development with that of others and seek for best practices . In this work , official statistics play an important role . The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ( OECD ) started systematic development of statistics on the information society in the 1990s , although the first pilot statistics on the phenomenon were already produced in the 1980s , that is , two decades ago . The development of statistics on the information society has progressed in steps - initially through clarification of concepts and definitions , then by exploitation of existing statistical data and eventually by designing statistics requiring new data collections . The OECD's exhaustive publication Monitoring the Information Economy 2002 contains scores of quantitative indicators for the monitoring of the state of the information society in different countries . In Europe , the eEurope 2002 indicators of the Commission of the European Union are used to monitor the progress towards the information society in the Member States . Besides quantitative monitoring , qualitative measuring is also applied to the eEurope programme . Thus , examples of follow-up systems already exist for a world-wide monitoring mechanism . Many countries already produce regular statistics depicting the information society , but the capability to compile them varies considerably from country to country . Some international recommendations are already available on the instruments - framework , concepts , definitions and classifications - that are needed in the compilation of these statistics but work on then is not finalised . Experience has shown that the development of a new statistical system takes several years . As an example of this , the first draft of the Handbook of Environmental Accounting that has just been completed was produced as far back as the early 1990s . The Fundamental Principles of Official Statistics approved by the United Nation ( UN ) in 1994 offer a good foundation on which statistical organisations throughout the world can build their activity . These principles state as follows : "" Official statistics provide an indispensable element in the information system of a democratic society , serving the government , the economy and the public with data about the economic , demographic , social and environmental situation . To this end , official statistics that meet the test of practical utility are to be compiled and made available on an impartial basis by official statistical agencies to honour citizens' entitlement to public information . "" The UN's statement emphasises that official statistics must be compiled according to scientific methods and internationally recognised classifications and definitions . Protection of suppliers' data must be unconditional . The statement further stresses the importance of co-ordination and co-operation . These fundamental principles of the UN are the preconditions without which production and functioning of official statistics can not even be started . Statistics describing the information society must also be developed in compliance with these principles . In its Declaration of Principles document , the World Summit on the Information Society will most probably adopt the key principles relating to the establishment of a sustainable information society . These will form the cornerstones on which the Summit's action plan and monitoring system will be built . The Declaration ( Draft , July 2003 ) sets out targets on the following areas : Information and communication infrastructure Access to information and knowledge The role of governments , the business sector and civil society in the promotion of ICTs for development Capacity building : human resources development , education and training Building confidence and security in the use of ICTs Enabling environment Promotion of development-oriented ICT-applications for all Cultural identity and linguistic diversity , local content and media development Ethical dimensions of the Information Society International and regional co-operation The declaration emphasises the need of an adequate information and communication ( IC ) infrastructure and the necessity to raise people's skills and competence , opportunities for the exploitation of ICT applications in all areas of life , and support of cultural diversity and creativity . These goals also serve as pointers for the statistical system that is needed to monitor their achievement . The importance of education and competence can not be emphasised enough when we speak about the development of the information society . From the perspective of a producer of official statistics it is satisfying to note that a Plan of Action , putting emphasis on the role of statistics in the monitoring process is also being drafted in support of the goals set in the declaration . Realisation of the goals of the information society will almost certainly be chiefly measured with qualitative instruments . Achievement of the targets relating to the legal environment or removal of constraints will probably be easiest to monitor with country-specific status reports and lists of actions . Monitoring of the attainment of the set goals also needs quantitative measures . Fortunately these do not have to be produced from scratch . International organisations already today produce a host of statistical information that can also be exploited for the monitoring of this declaration . The declaration concerning the development of the information society is not the first or only programme targeted at globally equitable human development . The UN's Millennium Development Goals were adopted by the UN Millennium Summit held in 2000 . Monitoring of the attainment of these goals has already started and several indicators used in it are also relevant for the monitoring of the declaration on the information society . International organisations should ensure that the indicators and statistics used in the monitoring of the other global programmes can also be exploited in the monitoring process that is about to be initiated now . The workload of national statistical offices should be minimised by maximising co-ordination between the statistical systems of international organisations . Systematic statistical monitoring requires organisation , co-ordination and division of responsibilities among international bodies . The system has to be efficient , and overlapping should be avoided . It would be prudent to draw up an inventory of the information international organisations already possess and of the recommendations that have been issued . For instance , the International Telecommunication Union ( ITU ) , the United Nations Educational , Scientific and Cultural Organization ( UNESCO ) , and the UN already collect statistical data that can be utilised . Successful selection of the essential ones , or so-called core indicators , of all the possible available measures is a major challenge to the monitoring of information society development . International organisations must also make sure that national statistical offices have at their disposal uniform and relevant concept definitions and other standards that support the compilation of statistics . Several examples of this already exist . Literacy of citizens is the decisive condition to the development of the information society . UNESCO conducts extensive collections of data on people's educational levels and participation rates in education in different countries . The ITU , for its part , follows the development and penetration of the telecommunications infrastructure in many countries . Existing mass communication and cultural statistics can provide data on printed media , and on digital content production and use in different countries . Besides providing classifications and methodological recommendations , international organisations already also offer tangible data collection instruments for statistical offices . The UN and the OECD , for instance , have published recommendations on how the information sector should be defined . The OECD has also reached unanimity about the definition of electronic commerce . Model questionnaires have been developed and approved within the OECD for inquiry surveys measuring the use of information and communication technologies . The purpose of these recommendations is to support the work of national statistical offices and ensure the availability of internationally comparable data . Unfortunately , monitoring of the progress of the information society can not be based on mere average figures for different countries . Besides producing data on literacy , diffusion of equipment stock or spread of Internet use , we should also know to what extent disparities in these occur between regions , or by socio-economic group or gender . Diverse national and international digital divide index calculation exercises have already been made . It is also necessary to monitor the impact of the taken measures on bridging this divide . There is also much international interest in statistics that can be utilised to analyse the coping of women and girls as exploiters of information technology . Over the past few years , the UN's city group - the Voorburg Group - which focuses on the development of statistics on service industries has been giving consideration to the development of statistics depicting the information society . The members of the group , thus far mainly statistical offices of developed countries , have had the opportunity to exchange information about their experiences and about best practices . The UN's Statistics Commission has discussed the establishment of a new forum for less developed countries . It might be defensible to suggest that while a monitoring system is being devised for the WSIS process , such a contact group be established within the framework of some subdivision of the UN . It would also be important to include the future users of the data in the development process at the international level . It is equally justified to wonder how international organisations could give assistance to less advanced countries in the development and compilation of basic statistics and indicators describing the information society . If support is given to the projects that are launched to implement the declaration , it would also be logical to support the development of the statistics that are needed in its monitoring . Commercial research institutes and private consulting companies produce a great deal of information about the penetration and use of information technology in different countries . The data are collected at the commission of customers who also pay for them , so demand for this kind of information quite obviously exists , and some of it is even available free of charge on the Internet . Why could the World Summit monitoring system not be based on this ? Use of statistics produced by commercial research institutes and consulting companies , as well as country-specific comparisons must be approached with certain reservations . The main concern relates to transparency of the used methods , which are often not publicly disclosed . Present research extends to a limited number of countries , mostly only those with the greatest economic influence . Data on developing countries are rarely available . The examined branches of industry or levels of education may deviate from those of official classifications , so the basic information otherwise available on them can not be used . Commercial research institutes generally only produce information that sells , which is fairly understandable . However , there is no commercial demand for many measures , such as those concerning equality between regions and genders , that are vital in the monitoring of information society development . When the World Summit adopts the Plan of Action , it entails initiation of an implementation and monitoring activity that will span over several years at both national and international levels . The information society perspective will become integrated into national policies . It also implicates that statistical offices will become bound by and committed to the development of statistics that serve the monitoring . Official statistics are expected , first and foremost , to give an accurate account of what is going on in society . Statistical offices must be able to provide relevant , reliable and up-to-date numerical information and support to decision-makers . Fulfilling this task is a major challenge to statistical offices at a time when society keeps changing fast and their resources are quite limited . The best foundation for statistics on the information society is a good infrastructure of official statistics . New data can often be effectively produced by reclassifying the data from household inquiries or statistics on manufacturing or foreign trade , or by attaching supplementary questions to existing survey inquiries . The cost of developing a new statistical system can be minimised by the exploitation of existing systems . Statistical monitoring of the information society has to be adapted to the other work and operating frameworks of statistical offices . At its next meeting in two year's time , the World Summit on the Information Society expects a follow-up report on the principles adopted at this meeting . This means that we have to be able to describe the present status quo and the development over the coming years . When new statistics are being developed it is good to bear in mind that the targets of statistical monitoring can not change from one year to the next , but time series are needed . The development work takes several years and requires close co-operation with the suppliers and users of data . When national information society programmes are being drawn up it is good if statistical offices can contribute to the work right from the beginning . A programme for the monitoring of strategies and action plans is vital , how else could their compilers obtain follow-up data on the present development that are impartial and independent , and comply with the ethical rules of statistics and research . As an example from my own country , Finland , I can quote that , keen to monitor progress , the Finnish Government charged Statistics Finland , in its first national Information Society Strategy in 1995 , with the responsibility to provide reports at regular intervals and to conduct occasional studies on the programme's impacts in society . Giving out a strategy means that we should be able to measure the development towards the given targets . Ever since then , Statistics Finland has participated closely in the national work on the development of the information society , and this work has also borne good fruit . Kofi Annan , Secretary-General of the United Nations , writes in the foreword of the UNCTAD E-Commerce and Development Report 2002 : "" If the world is serious about achieving the Millennium Development Goal of halving the number of people living in extreme poverty by the year 2015 , ICT must figure prominently in the effort . Everyone - governments , civil society , private sector businesses - has a vital stake in fostering digital opportunity and putting ICT at the service of development . "" Extensive adoption of ICT and raising of skills levels are global challenges of the information society . There are intermediate steps and clear milestones in the achievement of these targets . The WSIS requires monitoring of the key principles of the declaration . How capable is the international statistical community of responding to the challenge thrown at it ? How the task should be organised and the work of international organisations co-ordinated is a major challenge . Successful and relevant outlining of the frame of reference into which the indicators derived from the declaration can be placed is crucially important . Naturally , concepts and definitions need universal approval and introduction . All this must be well on the way by the Summit in Tunis in two years' time . Producing globally exhaustive statistics on the development of society would be an ambitious goal even with a longer timetable than this . I believe , however , that national statistical offices are keen to take up the challenge , provided the procedures and guidelines are agreed upon . </doc>

127,A7,"The Basic search help article covers all the most common issues , but sometimes you need a little bit more power . This document will highlight the more advanced features of Google Web Search . Have in mind though that even very advanced searchers , such as the members of the search group at Google , use these features less than 5 % of the time . Basic simple search is often enough . As always , we use square brackets [ ] to denote queries , so [ to be or not to be ] is an example of a query ; [ to be ] or [ not to be ] are two examples of queries . Phrase search ( "" "" ) By putting double quotes around a set of words , you are telling Google to consider the exact words in that exact order without any change . Google already uses the order and the fact that the words are together as a very strong signal and will stray from it only for a good reason , so quotes are usually unnecessary . By insisting on phrase search you might be missing good results accidentally . For example , a search for [ "" Alexander Bell "" ] ( with quotes ) will miss the pages that refer to Alexander G. Bell . Search within a specific website ( site : ) Google allows you to specify that your search results must come from a given website . For example , the query [ iraq site : nytimes . com ] will return pages about Iraq but only from nytimes . com . The simpler queries [ iraq nytimes . com ] or [ iraq New York Times ] will usually be just as good , though they might return results from other sites that mention the New York Times . You can also specify a whole class of sites , for example [ iraq site : . gov ] will return results only from a . gov domain and [ iraq site : . iq ] will return results only from Iraqi sites . Terms you want to exclude ( - ) Attaching a minus sign immediately before a word indicates that you do not want pages that contain this word to appear in your results . The minus sign should appear immediately before the word and should be preceded with a space . For example , in the query [ anti-virus software ] , the minus sign is used as a hyphen and will not be interpreted as an exclusion symbol ; whereas the query [ anti-virus - software ] will search for the words ' anti-virus ' but exclude references to software . You can exclude as many words as you want by using the - sign in front of all of them , for example [ jaguar - cars - football - os ] . The - sign can be used to exclude more than just words . For example , place a hyphen before the ' site : ' operator ( without a space ) to exclude a specific site from your search results . Fill in the blanks ( * ) The * , or wildcard , is a little-known feature that can be very powerful . If you include * within a query , it tells Google to try to treat the star as a placeholder for any unknown term ( s ) and then find the best matches . For example , the search [ Google * ] will give you results about many of Google's products ( go to next page and next page -- we have many products ) . The query [ Obama voted * on the * bill ] will give you stories about different votes on different bills . Note that the * operator works only on whole words , not parts of words . Search exactly as is ( + ) Google employs synonyms automatically , so that it finds pages that mention , for example , childcare for the query [ child care ] ( with a space ) , or California history for the query [ ca history ] . But sometimes Google helps out a little too much and gives you a synonym when you do n't really want it . By attaching a + immediately before a word ( remember , do n't add a space after the + ) , you are telling Google to match that word precisely as you typed it . Putting double quotes around a single word will do the same thing . The OR operator Google's default behavior is to consider all the words in a search . If you want to specifically allow either one of several words , you can use the OR operator ( note that you have to type ' OR ' in ALL CAPS ) . For example , [ San Francisco Giants 2004 OR 2005 ] will give you results about either one of these years , whereas [ San Francisco Giants 2004 2005 ] ( without the OR ) will show pages that include both years on the same page . The symbol | can be substituted for OR . ( The AND operator , by the way , is the default , so it is not needed . ) Exceptions Search is rarely absolute . Search engines use a variety of techniques to imitate how people think and to approximate their behavior . As a result , most rules have exceptions . For example , the query [ for better or for worse ] will not be interpreted by Google as an OR query , but as a phrase that matches a ( very popular ) comic strip . Google will show calculator results for the query [ 34 * 87 ] rather than use the ' Fill in the blanks' operator . Both cases follow the obvious intent of the query . Here is a list of exceptions to some of the rules and guidelines that were mentioned in this and the Basic Search Help article : Exceptions to ' Every word matters ' Words that are commonly used , like ' the , ' ' a , ' and ' for , ' are usually ignored ( these are called stop words ) . But there are even exceptions to this exception . The search [ the who ] likely refers to the band ; the query [ who ] probably refers to the World Health Organization -- Google will not ignore the word ' the ' in the first query . Synonyms might replace some words in your original query . ( Adding + before a word disables synonyms . ) A particular word might not appear on a page in your results if there is sufficient other evidence that the page is relevant . The evidence might come from language analysis that Google has done or many other sources . For example , the query [ overhead view of the bellagio pool ] will give you nice overhead pictures from pages that do not include the word ' overhead . ' Punctuation that is not ignored Punctuation in popular terms that have particular meanings , like [ C ++ ] or [ C # ] ( both are names of programming languages ) , are not ignored . The dollar sign ( $ ) is used to indicate prices . [ nikon 400 ] and [ nikon $ 400 ] will give different results . The hyphen - is sometimes used as a signal that the two words around it are very strongly connected . ( Unless there is no space after the - and a space before it , in which case it is a negative sign . ) The underscore symbol _ is not ignored when it connects two words , e . g . [ quick_sort ] . </doc>
